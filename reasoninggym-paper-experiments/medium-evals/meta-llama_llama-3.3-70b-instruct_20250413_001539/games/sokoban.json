The player's goal is to move the boxes (@) onto the goals (X), turning them into ($), while avoiding getting stuck or pushing a box into a corner or against a wall (+) in a way that it cannot be moved to a goal.\n\n2. Looking at the puzzle, there are several boxes and goals. The strategy involves moving each box to its nearest goal without blocking other boxes from reaching their goals.\n\n3. The player (*) starts at the bottom left. The closest box to the player is the one directly above it. However, moving this box directly upwards is not an option since it would block the path to other boxes and goals.\n\n4. First, we should move the box that is on the same row as the player but further to the right. This involves moving right to the box, then pushing it down to the goal below it.\n\n5. After that, we can address the boxes above the player. The box directly above the player needs to be moved to the left to avoid blocking the path to the box further right on the same row.\n\n6. Each box must be carefully maneuvered to its respective goal. Given the layout, the solution will involve a combination of moving right, left, up, and down to position each box correctly.\n\n7.

The closest box to the player that can be moved towards a goal is the one directly below it. However, we need to consider the overall layout and how moving one box might affect the movement of others.\n\n\n## Step 3: Move the First Box\nThe first box we can move is the one below the player. However, we need to move it towards the goal that is accessible without blocking other paths or getting stuck.\n\n\n## Step 4: Detailed Movement Plan\n1. Move down to the box below the player and push it towards the nearest goal (X) if possible.\n2. Identify any boxes that are blocking paths to goals and plan to move them first if necessary.\n3. Continue this process, moving boxes to their nearest accessible goals.\n\n\n## Step 5: Execution\nGiven the constraints of the puzzle and without the ability to visually update the board with each move, we'll describe the general approach:\n- Move down (D) to the first box and push it right (R) towards the goal if directly accessible.\n- For each box, determine the shortest path to an unoccupied goal, considering the need to avoid blocking paths for other boxes.\n- Utilize the walls (+) to our advantage, using them to guide boxes into place when necessary.\n\n\n## Step 6: Consider the Box on the Bottom Row\nThe box on the bottom row near the center needs to be moved up and to the left to reach its goal. This involves careful planning to ensure the path is clear.\n\n\n## Step 7: Finalize the Solution\nAfter moving all boxes onto their respective goals, ensure the player is not blocking any goals and adjust as necessary.\n\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>DDRURUUULLLDUUURRRDDDDLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRDDDDDDLLLLLUUUUUUUURRRRR</answer>",

Given the complexity of the puzzle and the need for a step-by-step solution, let's break it down into manageable parts.\n\n1. **Identify the Goals and Boxes**: There are 7 goals (X) and 6 boxes (@) that need to be moved onto these goals.\n\n2. **Plan the Movement**: The solution involves moving boxes to their respective goals. The player can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R).\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Movement**:\n    - Move the player to the first box and push it towards its nearest goal.\n    - Continue this process for each box, ensuring that the player can reach each box and has a path to push it to its goal without blocking other boxes or the player's path.\n    - Use the walls and the layout to guide the boxes to their goals efficiently.\n\nGiven the puzzle's layout and the rules of Sokoban, the solution will involve a series of precise movements to navigate the boxes into their correct positions

The player's position and movements are crucial for achieving this. Given the complexity of the puzzle, let's break down the steps into manageable parts, focusing on moving each box to its respective goal.\n\n\n## Step 1: Move the first box to the goal\nThe first box is located at the 5th row, and there's a goal at the same row. We need to move this box to the goal. Given the layout, the player must navigate around the existing boxes and walls to push the box to its goal without getting stuck.\n\n\n## Step 2: Move the second box to the goal\nAfter dealing with the first box, we focus on the second box, also on the 5th row. Similar to the first step, we need to maneuver the player to push this box to an available goal, taking care not to block paths needed for subsequent moves.\n\n\n## Step 3: Address the boxes on the 7th and 8th rows\nThe boxes on these rows need to be moved to their respective goals. This involves careful planning to ensure that each box is pushed to its goal without obstructing the movement of other boxes or the player.\n\n\n## Step 4: Solve for the remaining boxes\nWith the initial boxes moved, we focus on the remaining boxes, ensuring each is pushed onto a goal. This step requires precision, as the movement of one box can affect the accessibility of others.\n\n\n## Step 5: Final adjustments\nAfter all boxes are on goals, we might need to make some final adjustments to ensure the player is in a desired position or to correct any oversight in the movement of boxes.\n\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>LLDDUUURRRDDLLLLUUUUURRRDDDDLLLLLDLUURRRUUUUULDDDDDLLLLLLUUUURRRDDLLLLL</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step, analyzing the positions of the boxes (@) and the goals (X), and figuring out the most efficient path for the player (*) to move the boxes onto the goals.\n\n\n1. **Initial Assessment**: The puzzle has multiple boxes and goals.

The player's goal is to move the boxes onto the goals. There are walls that restrict movement.\n\n\n## Step 2: Identifying Key Moves\nFirst, focus on moving the box that is closest to a goal and has the least obstacles in its path. The box at the top left (4th row, 5th column) is a good candidate because it's near a goal and has fewer obstacles compared to the others.\n\n\n## Step 3: Moving the First Box\nTo move the first box onto a goal, the player needs to navigate around the existing walls and other boxes. This involves moving down and then left to push the box towards its goal.\n\n\n## Step 4: Addressing Subsequent Boxes\nAfter the first box is on a goal, assess the new layout and identify the next box to move. This process involves strategic planning to avoid pushing boxes into corners or against walls where they cannot be moved further.\n\n\n## Step 5: Solving the Puzzle\nContinue this process of identifying the next best move for each box, taking into account the changing layout as boxes are moved onto goals. The solution requires careful planning to ensure that each move sets up the next box to be moved efficiently.\n\n\n## Step 6: Finalizing the Solution\nThe exact sequence of moves can be complex due to the number of boxes and goals.
