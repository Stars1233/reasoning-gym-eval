The common factors are not immediately apparent from the initial prime factorization, so let's correct that: 6244 = 2^2 * 7 * 223, 1892 = 2^2 * 11 * 43, and 1505 = 5 * 7 * 43. The actual common prime factor among all three numbers is not present as initially thought; the correct common factor to consider for GCD calculation would be any shared prime factor, which upon reevaluation, is actually none since there's no prime factor common to all three numbers.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the GCD\nGiven the corrected understanding of the prime factors, we see that there are no common prime factors among all three numbers (6244, 1892, 1505). However, for calculating GCD, we look for the highest common factor that divides all numbers without a remainder. Since the initial analysis incorrectly suggested a common factor, let's directly calculate: The factors of 6244 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 223, 446, 892, 1561, 3122, 6244; of 1892 are 1, 2, 4, 11, 22, 43, 86, 172, 473, 946, 1892; and of 1505 are 1, 5, 7, 35, 43, 215, 301, 1505.

Starting with trial divisions or using algorithms for prime factorization, we find that 4695 = 3 * 5 * 313.\n\n## Step 3: Prime factorization of 2179\nNext, factorizing 2179, we find that 2179 = 17 * 128 + 15, but since 2179 is not easily broken down by simple division, we recognize it as a product of two primes, 7 and 311, thus 2179 = 7 * 311.\n\n## Step 4: Prime factorization of 8653\nFor 8653, it's not straightforward without a calculator, but it's actually 8653 = 7 * 1239, and further breaking down 1239 yields 1239 = 3 * 413, but since 413 is not a prime, we continue to 413 = 7 * 59. So, 8653 = 3 * 7 * 7 * 59.\n\n## Step 5: Prime factorization of 5326\n5326 can be factored into 2 * 2663. Further breaking down 2663 yields 2663 = 7 * 379, and since 379 is a prime, we have 5326 = 2 * 7 * 379.\n\n## Step 6: Identify common prime factors\nComparing the prime factorizations: 4695 = 3 * 5 * 313, 2179 = 7 * 311, 8653 = 3 * 7 * 7 * 59, and 5326 = 2 * 7 * 379, we see the common factor among all these numbers is not immediately apparent without calculating their GCD directly.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the GCD\nTo find the GCD, we look for the highest product of common prime factors. From the factorizations, only one prime factor appears in all numbers, which is not directly visible from the initial breakdown. Upon closer inspection, we realize the need to directly compute GCD, potentially using the Euclidean algorithm for accuracy.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the Euclidean algorithm\nGiven the complexity of manual calculations for GCD of multiple numbers, applying the Euclidean algorithm:\n- Start with GCD(4695, 2179), then use the result to find GCD(result, 8653), and finally GCD(last result, 5326).\n- GCD(4695, 2179) = GCD(2179, 4695 - 2*2179) = GCD(2179, 337) = 1 (since 337 and 2179 are coprime).\n- The process would continue, but given the initial mistake in step 6 regarding common factors, we recognize that calculating GCD directly for these numbers without a computational tool may lead to errors.\n\n## Step 9: Correct Approach for GCD Calculation\nGiven the numbers 4695, 2179, 8653, and 5326, and recognizing the error in manual factorization for GCD, the correct approach involves using the Euclidean algorithm or a similar method to directly calculate the GCD of these numbers without relying on incorrect factorization.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Further breaking down 2749, we find it is a product of 41 and 67 (since 2749 = 41 * 67), so the prime factors of 5498 are 2, 41, and 67.\n\n## Step 3: Prime factors of 9135\nThe prime factorization of 9135 is 3 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 29 (since 9135 = 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 29), so the prime factors of 9135 are 3, 5, 7, and 29.\n\n## Step 4: Prime factors of 6696\nThe prime factorization of 6696 is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 31 (since 6696 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 31), so the prime factors of 6696 are 2, 3, and 31.\n\n## Step 5: Prime factors of 8958\nThe prime factorization of 8958 is 2 * 3 * 1493. Further breaking down 1493, we find it is a prime number, so the prime factors of 8958 are 2, 3, and 1493.\n\n## Step 6: Identify common prime factors\nComparing the prime factors, we see that the only common prime factors among all numbers are 2 (for 5498, 6696, and 8958) and no other primes are common to all four numbers.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the GCD\nSince the only common prime factor is 2, and it appears in all numbers, the GCD will be the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power they appear with in any of the factorizations. In this case, that is 2^1.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Find the prime factors of each number\nTo find the GCD, first, we need to find the prime factors of each number. Let's start with 1276. The prime factorization of 1276 is 2^2 * 11 * 29. Then, for 9162, the prime factorization is 2 * 3 * 1527. Further breaking down 1527, we get 3 * 509, so 9162 is 2 * 3^2 * 509. For 7076, the prime factorization is 2^2 * 1769. Breaking down 1769, we get 29 * 61, so 7076 is 2^2 * 29 * 61. Lastly, for 6002, the prime factorization is 2 * 3001.

The common factor among all is 2.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the power of the common prime factor\nSince 2 is the only common prime factor, we need to find the smallest power of 2 that appears in the factorization of these numbers. From the factorizations, we see that 2 appears with a power of 1 in 9162 and 6002, and with a power of 2 in 1276 and 7076. Thus, the smallest power of 2 common to all numbers is 2^1, or simply 2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the GCD\nThe GCD of these numbers will be the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power they appear with in the factorizations. Since the only common prime factor is 2, and it appears with the smallest power of 1, the GCD is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",
