The prime factorization of 7150 is $2 \\times 5^2 \\times 11 \\times 13$ and the prime factorization of 16475 is $5^2 \\times 659$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the common prime factors.\nFrom the prime factorizations, we can see that both 7150 and 16475 share the common prime factor $5^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the GCD.\nThe GCD of 7150 and 16475 is the product of the common prime factors, which is $5^2 = 25$.\n\n## Step 5: Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\nTo simplify the fraction, we divide both 7150 and 16475 by 25. This gives us $\\frac{7150 \\div 25}{16475 \\div 25} = \\frac{286}{659}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{286}{659}}$",
