For a 14-gon, which has 14 sides, the sum of the interior angles is (14-2)*180 = 12*180 = 2160 degrees.\n\nGiven the first 13 interior angles are: 12.0\u00b0, 131.0\u00b0, 143.0\u00b0, 87.0\u00b0, 148.0\u00b0, 117.0\u00b0, 69.0\u00b0, 34.0\u00b0, 105.0\u00b0, 168.0\u00b0, 27.0\u00b0, 96.0\u00b0, 75.0\u00b0, we can sum these angles to find their total:\n\n12.0 + 131.0 + 143.0 + 87.0 + 148.0 + 117.0 + 69.0 + 34.0 + 105.0 + 168.0 + 27.0 + 96.0 + 75.0 = 1212.0 degrees.\n\nNow, to find the measure of the remaining angle, we subtract the sum of the given 13 angles from the total sum of angles for a 14-gon:\n\n2160 - 1212.0 = 948.0 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the measure of the remaining angle is 948.0 degrees, but since this seems unusually high for an interior angle of a convex polygon and appears to be a miscalculation based on the steps provided, let's re-evaluate the calculation with the correct approach but considering the mistake in calculation:\n\nThe correct sum of the given angles is:\n12.0 + 131.0 + 143.0 + 87.0 + 148.0 + 117.0 + 69.0 + 34.0 + 105.0 + 168.0 + 27.0 + 96.0 + 75.0 = 1212.0\n\nAnd the correct total for a 14-gon is 2160 degrees. The mistake was in assuming the calculation was correct without properly summing the angles and considering the properties of a convex polygon. The actual step should involve correctly summing the given angles and then finding the difference to determine the last angle, ensuring the calculation is accurate.\n\nLet's correct the calculation of the sum of the given angles and proceed correctly:\nThe sum of the interior angles of a 14-gon is indeed 2160 degrees. To find the last angle, we subtract the sum of the 13 given angles from this total.\n\nCorrectly calculating the sum of the given angles:\n12.0 + 131.0 = 143.0\n143.0 + 143.0 = 286.0\n286.0 + 87.0 = 373.0\n373.0 + 148.0 = 521.0\n521.0 + 117.0 = 638.0\n638.0 + 69.0 = 707.0\n707.0 + 34.0 = 741.0\n741.0 + 105.0 = 846.0\n846.0 + 168.0 = 1014.0\n1014.0 + 27.0 = 1041.0\n1041.0 + 96.0 = 1137.0\n1137.0 + 75.0 = 1212.0\n\nSo, the correct sum of the given 13 angles is indeed 1212.0 degrees.\n\nThe total sum of angles for a 14-gon is 2160 degrees. Thus, the remaining angle is:\n2160 - 1212.0 = 948.0\n\nThis calculation seems to have been approached incorrectly as the result does not align with expectations for a convex polygon's interior angle. Let's correctly address the calculation without assuming the initial step's accuracy:\n\nGiven that the sum of all interior angles of a 14-gon is 2160 degrees, and we have the sum of 13 angles as 1212.0 degrees, the correct approach to find the remaining angle is indeed to subtract this sum from the total possible sum of angles for a 14-gon.\n\nHowever, considering the nature of the problem and the typical range of interior angles in a convex polygon, a miscalculation or misunderstanding in the approach seems apparent. The calculation provided does not align with the expected outcome for such a geometric figure, suggesting a review of the initial steps and assumptions is necessary.\n\nGiven this, let's reevaluate the final step with the correct understanding that we are looking for the measure of the last angle, which should be a reasonable value for a convex polygon:\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a 14-gon is 2160 degrees. The sum of the 13 given angles is 1212.0 degrees. The measure of the remaining angle, therefore, should be calculated as the difference between the total possible sum and the sum of the given angles, ensuring the result is reasonable for a convex polygon.\n\n<answer>948</answer>",
