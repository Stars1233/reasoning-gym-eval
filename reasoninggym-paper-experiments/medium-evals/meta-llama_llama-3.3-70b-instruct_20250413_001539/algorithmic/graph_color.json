          "full_model_response": "To solve this graph coloring problem, we'll use a basic greedy coloring algorithm. This algorithm works by iterating through the vertices and assigning the smallest possible color that hasn't been used by any of its neighbors.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:\n\n1. **Sort the vertices**: Start with any vertex. For simplicity, we'll follow the order given: 0 through 17.\n2. **Assign colors**: For each vertex, check the colors of its neighbors. Assign the smallest color that is not used by any of its neighbors.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm:\n\n- Vertex 0 is connected to 17. Assign color 1 to 0.\n- Vertex 1 is connected to 6, 10, and 13. Assign color 1 to 1 (since none of its neighbors have been colored yet).\n- Vertex 2 is connected to 8 and 9. Assign color 1 to 2.\n- Vertex 3 is connected to 6. Assign color 1 to 3.\n- Vertex 4 has no connections mentioned, so assign color 1 to 4.\n- Vertex 5 is connected to 9 and 13. Assign color 1 to 5.\n- Vertex 6 is connected to 1, 3, 14, and 17. Since 1 and 3 have color 1, assign color 2 to 6.\n- Vertex 7 is connected to 15. Assign color 1 to 7.\n- Vertex 8 is connected to 2 and 17. Since 2 has color 1, assign color 2 to 8.\n- Vertex 9 is connected to 2 and 5. Since both have color 1, assign color 2 to 9.\n- Vertex 10 is connected to 1 and 13. Since 1 has color 1, assign color 2 to 10.\n- Vertex 11 is connected to 17. Assign color 1 to 11.\n- Vertex 12 has no connections mentioned, so assign color 1 to 12.\n- Vertex 13 is connected to 1, 5, and 10. Since 1, 5, and 10 have colors 1 and 2, assign color 3 to 13.\n- Vertex 14 is connected to 6. Since 6 has color 2, assign color 1 to 14.\n- Vertex 15 is connected to 7. Since 7 has color 1, assign color 2 to 15.\n- Vertex 16 has no connections mentioned except to 17. Assign color 1 to 16.\n- Vertex 17 is connected to 0, 6, 8, 11, and 16. Since these have colors 1 and 2, assign color 3 to 17.\n\nAfter applying the algorithm, we get the following coloring:\n\n<answer>{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2, \"10\": 2, \"11\": 1, \"12\": 1, \"13\": 3, \"14\": 1, \"15\": 2, \"16\": 1, \"17\": 3}</answer>",

We will use a simple greedy approach, iterating through the vertices and assigning the first available color that hasn't been used by any of its neighbors.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with vertex 0. Since it has no previously colored neighbors, we can assign it the first color, which is 1.\n2. Move to vertex 1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 0, which is colored with 1. So, we assign vertex 1 the next available color, which is 2.\n3. For vertex 2, since it has no neighbors that have been colored yet, we can assign it the first color, which is 1.\n4. Continue this process for all vertices, ensuring that each vertex is assigned a color that is different from all of its neighbors.\n\nAfter going through all the vertices and applying the greedy coloring algorithm, we get the following coloring:\n\n{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 3, \"4\": 3, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2, \"10\": 2, \"11\": 3, \"12\": 1, \"13\": 3}\n\nThis solution ensures that no two adjacent vertices in the graph have the same color, using the available colors [1, 2, 3, 4]. Note that vertex 12 has no edges connected to it, so it can be assigned any color, and we've chosen color 1 for simplicity. Also, note that color 4 is not used in this solution because it is not necessary to use all available colors to achieve a valid coloring.\n\n<answer>{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 3, \"4\": 3, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2, \"10\": 2, \"11\": 3, \"12\": 1, \"13\": 3}</answer>",

We will use a simple greedy approach, assigning the first available color to each vertex.\n\nFirst, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees (the number of edges incident on them) in descending order. This is a heuristic to ensure that we color the most constrained vertices first.\n\nNow, we will assign colors:\n\n- Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n- For each subsequent vertex, check the colors of its neighbors and assign the smallest available color that hasn't been used by any of its neighbors.\n\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\n\n1. Vertex 0: Assign color 1.\n2. Vertex 1: Assign color 2 (since 1 is available and not used by its neighbors).\n3. Vertex 2: Assign color 1 (available and not used by its neighbors).\n4. Vertex 3: Since there are no edges mentioned for vertex 3, we can assign color 1.\n5. Vertex 4: Assign color 2 (since its neighbors must have different colors, and we're trying to use the smallest available colors first).\n6. Vertex 5: Assign color 1.\n7. Vertex 6: Assign color 1 (no edges mentioned).\n8. Vertex 7: Assign color 2 (to differentiate from its neighbors).\n9. Vertex 8: Assign color 3 (since it's connected to vertices that could have colors 1 and 2).\n10. Vertex 9: Assign color 3 (to differentiate from its neighbors).\n11. Vertex 10: Assign color 3 (considering its connections).\n12. Vertex 11: Assign color 2 (to differentiate from vertex 10).\n13. Vertex 12: Assign color 2.\n14. Vertex 13: Assign color 2 (to differentiate from vertex 0).\n15. Vertex 14: Assign color 2 (considering its connection to vertex 9).\n16. Vertex 15: Assign color 1 (no edges mentioned).\n17.

However, since vertex 9 already has color 2 and isn't connected to vertex 8, we could also choose another color.

Assign it color 2 (since 1 is used by 0, but 0 and 1 are not connected, this is not a constraint here).\n3. Vertex 2: Connected to vertex 7. Assign it color 1 (since it's not connected to 0, and we want to minimize the number of colors used).\n4. Vertex 3: Not connected to any vertex mentioned, so we can assign it color 1.\n5. Vertex 4: Not connected, assign color 1.\n6. Vertex 5: Not connected, assign color 1.\n7. Vertex 6: Connected to vertices 1 and 8. Since 1 has color 2, assign it color 1.\n8. Vertex 7: Connected to vertices 2, 9, 15, and 17. Since 2 has color 1, assign it color 2.\n9. Vertex 8: Connected to vertices 6 and 9. Since 6 has color 1, assign it color 2.\n10. Vertex 9: Connected to vertices 7 and 8. Since both have colors assigned (2 and 2), assign it color 1.\n11. Vertex 10: Connected to vertices 12 and 14. Assign it color 1 (considering the connections and trying to minimize colors).\n12. Vertex 11: Connected to vertices 8 and 17. Since 8 has color 2, assign it color 1.\n13. Vertex 12: Connected to vertices 10 and 15. Since 10 has color 1, assign it color 2.\n14. Vertex 13: Connected to vertex 15. Assign it color 1 (to differentiate from 15's eventual color).\n15. Vertex 14: Connected to vertices 1 and 10. Since 1 has color 2 and 10 has color 1, assign it color 3 (to ensure difference from both).\n16. Vertex 15: Connected to vertices 7, 12, and 13. Since 7 has color 2 and 12 has color 2, assign it color 1 (considering the connections).\n17. Vertex 16: Connected to vertex 1. Since 1 has color 2, assign it color 1.\n18. Vertex 17: Connected to vertices 7 and 11. Since 7 has color 2, assign it color 1.\n\nAfter considering all connections and attempting to minimize the number of colors used while ensuring no adjacent vertices have the same color, we have a coloring solution. However, the exact assignment might vary based on the algorithm's specifics and the order in which vertices are processed. The goal is to ensure that the graph is colored such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, using the fewest colors possible.\n\nGiven the constraints and aiming for simplicity, here's a potential coloring solution in JSON format:\n\n<answer>{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1, \"10\": 1, \"11\": 1, \"12\": 2, \"13\": 1, \"14\": 3, \"15\": 1, \"16\": 1, \"17\": 1}</answer>",
