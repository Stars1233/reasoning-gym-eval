For each pair of characters, check if the character from string1 is already in map1. If it is, verify that its mapped value matches the current character in string2. If it doesn't match, return False.\n4. If the character from string1 is not in map1, check if the character from string2 is already a value in map1 (to ensure no two characters in string1 map to the same character in string2). If it is, return False because this violates the isomorphic condition.\n5. If the character from string2 is not already in map2, add the mapping from string1 to string2 and from string2 to string1.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all characters in both strings have been processed.\n7. If the loop completes without returning False, the strings are isomorphic, so return True.\n\nHowever, due to the complexity and the length of the strings provided, and without executing the actual code to check for isomorphism, the detailed step-by-step process is described above. For practical purposes, one would write a Python function to perform these checks:\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(string1, string2):\n    if len(string1)!= len(string2):\n        return False\n    \n    map1 = {}\n    map2 = {}\n    \n    for char1, char2 in zip(string1, string2):\n        if (char1 in map1 and map1[char1]!= char2) or (char2 in map2 and map2[char2]!= char1):\n            return False\n        map1[char1] = char2\n        map2[char2] = char1\n    \n    return True\n\nstring1 = \"xorzblnjeybchvlvjzcmjkphhercmctctgloyaujzibsdkggufnnomllkufkzdtxxlqfyenkjxgd\"\nstring2 = \"mzrhvsjdynvqttstdhqadgekkyrqaqbqblsznuidhxvwpglliojjzassgioghpbmmsconyjgdmlp\"\n\nprint(are_isomorphic(string1, string2))\n```\n\nGiven the nature of the task, let's provide the answer based on the process described:\n\n<answer>False</answer>",
