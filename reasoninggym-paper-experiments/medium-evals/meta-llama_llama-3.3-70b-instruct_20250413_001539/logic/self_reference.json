However, this seems to directly conflict with the nature of the problem which typically involves some level of falsehood among the statements to create a puzzle.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 asserts that exactly 5 of the statements are true. This gives a specific condition that can be tested against the other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 says exactly 4 of the statements are false, which means exactly 3 are true. This directly contradicts Statement 3, indicating these two statements cannot both be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the direct contradiction between Statements 3 and 4, this statement seems plausible as it acknowledges the exclusivity of these conditions.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible number of true statements, according to this rule, could be any of these primes.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that for Statement 7 to be true, there must be either 4 or 6 false statements, meaning 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Consistency Across Statements\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 allows for 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 2 implies all statements are true, which is unlikely given the puzzle's nature.\n- Statement 3 specifies exactly 5 true statements.\n- Statement 4 specifies exactly 3 true statements (since 4 are false).\n- Statement 5 says only one of Statement 3 or 4 can be true.\n- Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6), implying 3 or 1 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Identifying Possible Solutions\nFrom the analysis, the only prime number of true statements that also satisfies other conditions (like Statement 1 and potentially Statement 7 if considering 4 false statements) is 5 true statements, as suggested by Statement 3. This is because:\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (Statement 3), it satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6 (since 5 is prime).\n- It does not directly conflict with Statement 7, as 2 false statements do not fit the composite requirement, but this is a point of tension since Statement 7 specifically requires a composite number of false statements, which would be 4 or 6 false statements.\n\n## Step 10: Resolving the Tension\nGiven the constraints, especially from Statements 3, 6, and the requirement for consistency:\n- Statement 3 (exactly 5 true) seems like a central condition to satisfy several other statements.\n- However, Statement 7's requirement for a composite number of false statements (implying 1 or 3 true statements) cannot be directly satisfied if we adhere strictly to Statement 3's condition without considering the implications of all statements together.\n\n## Step 11: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements, the puzzle's solution hinges on finding a condition that satisfies the majority of the statements without direct contradiction. Statement 3 offers a clear, testable condition. However, upon closer inspection, the puzzle's constraints, especially around prime and composite numbers of true and false statements, respectively, suggest a nuanced approach is necessary.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 8: Considering Possible Scenarios\n- If Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 4 is false, and there are 2 true statements among Statements 3 and 4, satisfying Statement 5. However, this contradicts Statement 1.\n- If Statement 4 is true (5 true statements), similar to the scenario with Statement 3, this contradicts Statement 1.\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7). Given Statement 1's requirement, only 6 or 7 true statements are possible, but 6 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite (4 or 6), which aligns with having 3 or 1 true statements, respectively, but this does not satisfy Statement 1 or Statement 6 directly.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Consistency\nGiven the constraints and analyzing the statements together:\n- Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true (by Statement 5), and they contradict Statement 1.\n- Statement 6 allows for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements, but only 7 true statements satisfy Statement 1 without contradiction.\n- Statement 7 suggests 4 or 6 false statements, which means 3 or 1 true statements, respectively, but this does not align with the prime requirement of Statement 6 for the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nThe only scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction is having exactly 7 true statements, which would make Statement 1 true, Statement 2 true by default (since 0 false statements is within \"at most 7 false\"), Statement 5 false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 can be true, Statement 6 true because 7 is a prime number, and Statement 7 true because 0 false statements is not composite but this condition is satisfied in a trivial sense as there are no false statements to count. However, this creates a paradox with Statement 5 being false, which was not directly considered in the initial analysis steps but is crucial for understanding the interplay of these statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that 4 statements are true (either directly or by stating 3 are false), they essentially say the same thing regarding the number of true statements. Thus, if one is true, the other must also be considered true in terms of the outcome (4 true statements), but Statement 5's condition that \"but not both\" creates a paradox if taken literally because both lead to the same numerical outcome.

This is because:\n- Having exactly 4 true statements (as per Statements 3 and 4) does not satisfy Statement 6 (since 4 is not a prime number).\n- Having exactly 5 true statements satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true), does not directly contradict Statement 2 (since it's possible for 2 statements to be false if we consider the statements' implications broadly), fits Statement 6 (5 is a prime number), and aligns with Statement 7 if we consider the number of false statements (2, which is not composite, but this is a point of potential inconsistency depending on interpretation).\n\n## Step 11: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and analyzing each statement, the solution that best fits without causing a paradox or contradiction, especially considering the prime requirement and the composite false statements, seems to hinge on the interpretation of \"possible solutions\" as scenarios where all statements can logically coexist without contradiction, which appears challenging given the constraints.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means the number of true statements can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 1 of the 7 statements is false. This implies that the number of true statements can be 6 or 7, since having 0 false statements means all are true, and having 1 false statement means 6 are true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 6 of the 7 statements are true. This directly implies that only 1 statement is false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 2 of the 7 statements are false. This means that 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This creates a condition where we have to consider the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 exclusively.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible number of true statements, according to this statement, can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that the number of false statements can be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements can be 3 or 1, respectively.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Compatibility and Constraints\n- From Statement 3 and Statement 4, with Statement 5 indicating they cannot both be true, we have to choose between them. If Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are true, and only 1 is false. If Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true, and 2 are false.\n- Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be a prime number. This supports the scenarios where 2, 3, 5, or 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 7 indicates the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6), supporting scenarios where 3 or 1 statements are true, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Identifying Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- If Statement 3 is true (6 true, 1 false), it satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 (since 6 is not prime, this actually doesn't satisfy Statement 6, indicating a potential mistake in considering 6 as a possible prime outcome). It does not satisfy Statement 7 because 1 false statement is not composite.\n- If Statement 4 is true (5 true, 2 false), it satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6 (since 5 is prime). It does not directly satisfy Statement 2 (which requires at most 1 false statement), indicating a conflict.\n- Considering Statement 6, for the number of true statements to be prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and combining with other statements:\n- For 7 true statements, it satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 but does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 0 false statements is not composite).\n- For 5 true statements, it satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6 but conflicts with Statement 2 and does not directly satisfy Statement 7.\n- For 3 true statements, it satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6 and also satisfies Statement 7 (since 4 false statements are composite), but it conflicts with Statement 2.\n- For 2 true statements, it satisfies Statement 6 but does not satisfy Statement 1 (which requires at least 3 true statements) and does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 5 false statements are not composite in the context required here).\n\n## Step 10: Resolving Conflicts and Identifying Valid Solutions\nUpon careful analysis, the only scenario that seems to potentially satisfy all given conditions without direct conflict, considering the prime requirement and composite false statements, is when exactly 5 statements are true. However, this creates a conflict with Statement 2. The scenario with 6 true statements (Statement 3) conflicts with the prime requirement of Statement 6 and the composite requirement of Statement 7.

Statement 1 implies that at least 5 out of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 suggests that at most 5 out of the 7 statements are false, which is equivalent to saying at least 2 statements are true.

Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, even though they essentially say the same thing. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number, and Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 3 and Statement 4\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially convey the same information (exactly 5 statements being true), Statement 5's assertion that only one of them can be true seems to introduce a paradox since they are equivalent in meaning. However, the key here is to understand that Statement 5 is trying to create a distinction where there isn't one in terms of truth value regarding the number of true or false statements.\n\n## Step 3: Considering the Implications of Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 implies that the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7). Given that we have 7 statements, the possible numbers of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

This scenario satisfies Statement 1 (at least 5 true), does not directly conflict with Statement 2 (since 2 false statements mean 5 true statements), and aligns with the condition that the number of true statements is a prime number (5 is prime). However, 2 false statements do not satisfy Statement 7 since 2 is not a composite number.\n- For the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), we need either 4 or 6 false statements, which means 3 or 1 true statements, respectively. Neither of these scenarios satisfies the prime number condition for true statements as stated in Statement 6 because 3 is prime but having only 1 true statement does not satisfy the conditions set by Statements 1, 3, or 4.\n\n## Step 5: Identifying Valid Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the seeming contradiction or impossibility of satisfying all statements simultaneously due to their specific claims about the number of true and false statements, we must look for scenarios that could potentially satisfy all given conditions without violating the principles of logic.\n\n## Step 6: Conclusion\nUpon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the statements are crafted in such a way that they create a logical puzzle. Statements 3 and 4 essentially say the same thing (5 true statements), which would mean 2 false statements. This does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite). The only prime number of true statements that could potentially satisfy all conditions, including Statement 6, is 5, but this leads to a contradiction with Statement 7.

Composite numbers among these are 4, 6.\n\nGiven these statements, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If **Statement 3** is true (exactly 5 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false (because of Statement 5), and we have 2 false statements. This scenario makes Statement 7 true (2 is not composite, so this actually contradicts our initial assumption about Statement 7, but let's continue analyzing all statements). Statement 6 would also be true because 5 is a prime number. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are also true under this scenario. However, Statement 7 says the number of false statements (2 in this case) should be composite, which 2 is not, creating a contradiction.\n\n- If **Statement 4** is true (exactly 4 false statements), then exactly 3 statements are true. This makes Statement 3 false. Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Statement 6 is true because 3 is a prime number. Statement 1 is also true. Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false (in this case, exactly 4 are false, which does not satisfy Statement 2 as written, indicating a mistake in this line of reasoning). Statement 7 is true because 4 (the number of false statements) is composite.\n\nConsidering the constraints and looking for consistency:\n- The only consistent scenario without contradictions, given the analysis above, seems to hinge on the interpretation of Statement 7 and the composite nature of the number of false statements, along with the prime number of true statements. However, upon closer inspection, the initial analysis overlooked the direct implications of Statement 5 and the interplay between Statements 3, 4, 6, and 7.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation:\n- **Statement 3** being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 7 because 2 (the number of false statements if Statement 3 is true) is not composite.\n- **Statement 4** being true means 3 statements are true, which aligns with Statement 6 (since 3 is prime) but does not directly satisfy the conditions without considering the implications of all other statements.\n\nThe correct approach to finding the number of possible solutions involves systematically checking each statement against the others for consistency, considering the constraints provided by each. However, the explanation provided initially contains inaccuracies in resolving these constraints, particularly in how the truth of one statement affects the others, notably around the prime and composite conditions and the implications of Statement 5.\n\nUpon careful consideration and correcting the approach:\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (Statement 3), this contradicts the condition that the number of false statements (2) must be composite (Statement 7), since 2 is not composite.\n- If exactly 4 statements are false (Statement 4), then 3 are true, which satisfies Statement 6 (3 is prime) but we must ensure all statements can consistently align with this scenario.\n\nReevaluating the statements with the correct methodology:\n1. At least 1 statement is true (must be true).\n2. At most 3 statements are false (implies at least 4 are true).\n3. Exactly 5 statements are true (contradicts with the composite requirement for false statements).\n4. Exactly 4 statements are false (means 3 are true, which could satisfy the prime requirement but contradicts the at least 4 true statements from Statement 2).\n5. Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. The number of true statements is a prime number.\n7. The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nGiven these constraints and correcting for the oversight:\n- The scenario where **3 statements are true** (to satisfy the prime condition) and **4 are false** (to satisfy the composite condition for false statements) seems plausible at first glance but contradicts Statement 2 (at most 3 are false).\n\nThe only scenario that seems to potentially fit without contradiction, upon a detailed reevaluation considering the prime and composite conditions along with the constraints of Statements 1 through 5, involves a careful balancing act that was initially miscalculated.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the number of true statements could be any of these.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies the number of false statements could be 4 or 6, meaning 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\nGiven these statements, let's find a scenario that satisfies all conditions:\n\n- From **Statement 2**, we can't have more than 1 false statement, which contradicts the possibility of having exactly 4 true statements as per **Statements 3 and 4**.\n- **Statement 6** suggests the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7), and **Statement 7** suggests the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6), which implies 3 or 1 true statement(s), respectively.\n- **Statement 5** allows for either **Statement 3** or **Statement 4** to be true but given they essentially convey the same information and contradict **Statement 2**, we must consider scenarios where these could potentially align with **Statements 6 and 7**.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we see that:\n\n- **Statement 1** requires at least 2 true statements.\n- **Statement 2** allows for at most 1 false statement, implying 6 or 7 true statements.\n- **Statement 6** requires a prime number of true statements.\n- **Statement 7** requires a composite number of false statements.\n\nThe only prime number of true statements that also satisfies **Statement 2** (at most 1 false statement) is 7 true statements, as 6 is not a prime number. However, 7 true statements contradict **Statements 3 and 4** directly but satisfy **Statement 1** and the condition of **Statement 6** (prime number of true statements). With 7 true statements, **Statement 7** is also satisfied because there would be 0 false statements, and 0 is not considered composite or prime in this context, creating a potential issue. However, the condition of having a composite number of false statements (Statement 7) is not directly satisfied by any scenario that also satisfies Statement 2 without contradiction.\n\nGiven these constraints and looking for a scenario that minimizes contradiction:\n\n- If we have 7 true statements, it satisfies **Statements 1, 2, and 6** but contradicts **Statements 3, 4, and potentially 7** because 0 false statements do not fit the composite requirement directly.\n- Any scenario with exactly 4 true statements (as per **Statements 3 and 4**) contradicts **Statement 2**.\n\nThus, the puzzle as presented creates a paradox where satisfying all statements without any contradiction proves to be challenging due to the inherent contradictions between statements like 2 and 3/4. However, exploring possible solutions under the constraints:\n\nThe most straightforward path to resolving the paradox while adhering to the format and considering the logical inconsistencies presented is acknowledging that:\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This means the number of true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 1 of the 7 statements is false. This implies that the number of true statements can be 6 or 7, since having 0 false statements means all are true, and having 1 false statement means 6 are true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 4 of the 7 statements are true. This gives a specific number of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 3 of the 7 statements are false, which means exactly 4 are true. This is equivalent to Statement 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, since Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, this statement essentially says that one of these equivalent statements is true, implying exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the number of true statements could be any of these.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This means the number of false statements could be 4 (meaning 3 true statements) or 6 (meaning 1 true statement), but since 4 false statements imply 3 true statements, which contradicts the requirement for at least 4 true statements from Statement 1, we focus on the feasibility of these statements together.\n\n## Step 8: Combining the Information\nFrom Statement 1 and Statement 2, we have a range of possible true statements (4 to 7). Statement 3 and Statement 4 narrow it down to exactly 4 true statements, which aligns with Statement 5's condition that one of them (but essentially both, due to equivalence) must be true. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime, and Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Feasibility\nGiven that Statements 3 and 4 are equivalent and imply exactly 4 true statements, this satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true) and Statement 5 (one of them true). However, it does not satisfy Statement 2 (at most 1 false, implying 6 or 7 true), creating a contradiction. For Statement 6, a prime number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but only 5 and 7 satisfy Statement 1 and could potentially satisfy Statement 2. Statement 7 suggests 4 or 6 false statements, but given the constraints, only having 4 false (and thus 3 true) statements contradicts the minimum requirement of 4 true statements from Statement 1.\n\n## Step 10: Resolving the Contradictions\nThe key contradiction lies between the specific numbers of true statements required by different statements. Statements 3 and 4 (exactly 4 true) contradict Statement 2 (at most 1 false, implying 6 or 7 true). Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) further constrain the possibilities. Given these constraints, we must find a scenario that satisfies all statements without contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Final Evaluation\nConsidering all statements, the only scenario that satisfies the conditions without contradiction is having exactly 5 true statements. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true), does not directly contradict Statement 2 (though it's not the only interpretation, it's a possible one given the phrasing), aligns with Statement 6 (5 is a prime number), and for Statement 7, having 2 false statements (which is not composite) seems to contradict, but given the constraints and focusing on the prime requirement for true statements, we prioritize the satisfaction of Statement 6 and the implication of at least 4 true from Statement 1.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This implies that the number of true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means the number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7, since having 3 or more false statements would violate this condition.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then all other statements must be false, which immediately creates a contradiction with Statements 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This statement cannot be true because if all statements are false, then Statement 4 itself would be false, creating a paradox.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true without creating a contradiction or paradox, this statement's truthfulness hinges on the validity of Statement 3 or Statement 4, both of which are problematic.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the number of true statements could be any of these, but considering the constraints from Statements 1 and 2, the feasible options are narrowed down.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that the number of false statements could be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements could be 3 or 1, respectively.\n\nGiven these constraints:\n\n- **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** cannot both be true, and given their nature, they create immediate contradictions if considered true.\n- **Statement 1** and **Statement 2** suggest that at least 4 statements must be true and at most 2 can be false, which aligns with the possibility of 5 or more true statements.\n- **Statement 6** suggests the number of true statements must be a prime number, which could be 5 (given the constraints from Statements 1 and 2).\n- **Statement 7** suggests the number of false statements is composite, which could align with having 4 false statements (and thus 3 true statements), but this contradicts the minimum requirement set by Statement 1.\n\nConsidering all statements, the only feasible scenario that does not immediately create a contradiction and satisfies the conditions of at least 4 true statements (from Statement 1) and the prime number condition (from Statement 6) is having exactly 5 true statements. This would mean Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 are true, and Statements 3 and 4 are false. \n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, even this scenario presents challenges because if Statement 5 is true, it implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, which contradicts our initial assessment that both must be false due to their paradoxical nature.\n\nThus, the puzzle as presented does not have a straightforward solution that satisfies all conditions without creating a logical contradiction, primarily due to the self-referential nature of the statements and the constraints they impose on each other.\n\n<answer>0</answer>",

Given that we have at least 4 true statements (from Statement 1) and exactly 3 false statements (from Statement 4), this means we have 4 true statements. However, 4 is not a prime number, which creates a potential issue. But we must consider the total number of statements and the conditions given to assess the truthfulness of all statements.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Since Statement 4 is true and states that exactly 3 of these statements are false, and 3 is not a composite number (it's prime), this statement could potentially be false.\n\n## Step 8: Combining Information\nFrom the steps above, we know:\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 4 being true and Statement 3 being false, so it's true.\n- Statement 1 could be true, as it says at least 4 statements are true, and we have at least 2 true (Statement 4 and Statement 5) with potential for more.\n- Statement 2 is true because it says at most 5 statements are false, and we have exactly 3 false.\n- Statement 6 might be false because 4 (the number of true statements if all conditions are met minimally) is not prime.\n- Statement 7 might be false because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Finalizing True and False Statements\nGiven Statement 4 is true, and exactly 3 statements are false, we've identified Statement 3 as false. Statement 7 is also false because 3 is not a composite number. This leaves us with one more false statement to identify. Statement 6 is a candidate because if we have 4 true statements, the number of true statements is not prime, making Statement 6 false.\n\n## Step 10: Counting True Statements\nWe have:\n- Statement 4 as true.\n- Statement 5 as true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 2 as true because it aligns with the condition of having exactly 3 false statements.\n- Statement 1 could be true, but its truth depends on the total count of true statements.\n\n## Step 11: Determining the Number of Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the steps above, we need to find how many combinations of true and false statements satisfy all given conditions. Since Statement 4 is true, and we have exactly 3 false statements, and given the constraints from other statements, we are looking for a scenario where:\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 7 is false.\n- One more statement must be false to satisfy Statement 4, which could be Statement 6 due to its claim about the number of true statements being prime.\n- This leaves us with Statements 1 and 2, which can be true under the condition that we have at least 4 true statements (satisfying Statement 1) and at most 5 false statements (satisfying Statement 2).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This directly contradicts both Statements 2 and 3.\n\n5. **Statement 5** says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.

The relevant primes here could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since we're dealing with 7 statements.\n\n7. **Statement 7** says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are those that have at least one divisor other than 1 and themselves. Relevant composites for our case could be 2, 4, or 6, given we're dealing with 7 statements.\n\nLet's consider the implications of these statements together:\n\n- **If Statement 3 is true**, then exactly 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. This would mean Statement 4 is false (satisfying Statement 5), and since 1 is not a composite number, Statement 7 would be false. However, 6 being true satisfies the \"at least 2 true\" condition of Statement 1, but it contradicts Statement 2's implication that at most 2 are false (since only 1 is false, it technically satisfies this but is not the only condition). The number of true statements (6) is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Thus, we have a potential distribution where Statements 1, 3 are true, and Statements 2, 4, 6, 7 are false, but this doesn't hold because Statement 6 being false doesn't fit the prime condition for true statements, indicating a misunderstanding in this step of analysis.\n\n- **Correcting the analysis**: Let's reassess with a focus on the conditions given and the potential for satisfying all statements:\n\n1. **Statement 3** being true means 6 true statements, which contradicts Statement 4 directly.

This means we have a minimum threshold but doesn't give us a specific number to work with directly.\n\n2. **Statement 2** says at most 2 of the statements are false, which implies that at least 5 of the statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3** claims exactly 6 of the statements are true, which directly contradicts Statement 2 if Statement 2 is true because if exactly 6 are true, then only 1 is false, fitting Statement 2's condition.\n\n4. **Statement 4** says exactly 3 of the statements are false, meaning exactly 4 are true. This directly contradicts both Statements 2 and 3.\n\n5. **Statement 5** says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the contradictions, this statement can only be true if one of them is indeed true and the other false, but given their direct contradiction with other statements, we need to consider the implications of each being true or false carefully.\n\n6. **Statement 6** claims the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The relevant primes here could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since we're dealing with 7 statements.\n\n7. **Statement 7** says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are those that have at least one divisor other than 1 and themselves. Relevant composites for our case could be 2, 4, or 6, given we're dealing with 7 statements.\n\nLet's consider the implications of these statements together:\n\n- **If Statement 3 is true**, then exactly 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. This would mean Statement 4 is false (satisfying Statement 5), and since 1 is not a composite number, Statement 7 would be false. However, 6 being true satisfies the \"at least 2 true\" condition of Statement 1, but it contradicts Statement 2's implication that at most 2 are false (since only 1 is false, it technically satisfies this but is not the only condition). The number of true statements (6) is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Thus, we have a potential distribution where Statements 1, 3 are true, and Statements 2, 4, 6, 7 are false, but this doesn't hold because Statement 6 being false doesn't fit the prime condition for true statements, indicating a misunderstanding in this step of analysis.\n\n- **Correcting the analysis**: Let's reassess with a focus on the conditions given and the potential for satisfying all statements:\n\n1. **Statement 3** being true means 6 true statements, which contradicts Statement 4 directly. If Statement 3 is true, then for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 4 must be false. However, with 6 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number, and Statement 7 is also false because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n2. **Statement 4** being true means 4 true statements and 3 false statements. This satisfies Statement 7 (since 3 is not composite, this is actually a contradiction), but it does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 6 directly because 4 is not a prime number.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's simplify:\n\n- For **Statement 6** to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7). \n- For **Statement 7** to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (2, 4, 6).\n\nThe only scenario where both can potentially be true (considering the constraints of all statements) is when we have a distribution that satisfies both the prime condition for true statements and the composite condition for false statements.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the direct analysis of each statement against the others reveals contradictions and complexities that suggest a simplified approach might be more appropriate:\n\n- If **exactly 6 statements are true** (Statement 3), then only 1 is false, which doesn't fit Statement 7's requirement for a composite number of false statements.\n- If **exactly 4 statements are true** (to satisfy a potential prime number of truths), this doesn't directly align with any statement's conditions without contradicting others.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation, the key insight comes from recognizing the limitations and potential truths based on prime and composite numbers, alongside the specific claims of each statement.

However, since Statements 3 and 4 essentially state the same condition (4 true statements), Statement 5 is more about the exclusivity of the condition rather than the condition itself.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible number of true statements according to this statement is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4, 6. This means the possible number of false statements is 4 or 6, implying 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Finding Overlapping Conditions\nTo find possible solutions, we need to look for overlapping conditions that satisfy multiple statements simultaneously.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluating Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together\nSince Statements 3 and 4 both imply 4 true statements, and given Statement 5's condition that only one of them can be true, we have to consider if 4 true statements can satisfy other conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Considering Statement 6\nGiven that 4 is not a prime number, Statement 6 cannot be satisfied if 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 12: Considering Statement 7\nIf 4 statements are true, then 3 are false. 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is not satisfied under this condition.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluating Other Possibilities\nWe must evaluate other possible numbers of true statements that could satisfy multiple conditions simultaneously, especially considering the constraints of prime and composite numbers.\n\n## Step 14: Checking for Prime True Statements\nFrom Statement 6, possible numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7. We need to see if any of these satisfy the other conditions.\n\n## Step 15: Checking for Composite False Statements\nFrom Statement 7, if the number of false statements is 4 or 6, this implies 3 or 1 true statements, respectively. We need to check if these conditions can satisfy the other statements.\n\n## Step 16: Analyzing Statement 1 and Statement 2 Together\nBoth Statement 1 and Statement 2 can be satisfied with 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements, but we need to find which of these, if any, satisfy all given conditions.\n\n## Step 17: Checking Consistency Across All Statements\nGiven the constraints, we need to find a scenario where all statements can be consistently true or false without contradiction.\n\n## Step 18: Evaluating the Scenario with 3 True Statements\nIf exactly 3 statements are true, this satisfies Statement 1 (at least 3 true), does not directly contradict Statement 2 (since 3 false is within \"at most 3 false\" if considering the statements' implications broadly), and aligns with Statement 6 (3 is a prime number). However, it contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4 directly.\n\n## Step 19: Evaluating the Scenario with 5 True Statements\n5 true statements would mean 2 false statements. This satisfies Statement 1, does not contradict Statement 2, and aligns with Statement 6 (5 is a prime number). However, 2 false statements contradict Statement 7 (since 2 is not a composite number).\n\n## Step 20: Evaluating the Scenario with 7 True Statements\n7 true statements mean 0 false statements. This satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2 but contradicts Statement 7 (since 0 is not considered composite in this context).\n\n## Step 21: Finding a Consistent Solution\nAfter analyzing, we find that having exactly 3 true statements could potentially satisfy the conditions given by the statements, especially considering the prime and composite constraints. However, we must ensure this does not contradict any statement directly.\n\n## Step 22: Final Evaluation\nGiven the analysis, the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions without contradiction appears limited. We need to identify a scenario that fits all given statements without violating their conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means we have a range from 2 to 7 true statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 4 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that we can have from 0 to 4 false statements, which translates to having 3 to 7 true statements.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 states that exactly 5 of the 7 statements are true. This gives us a fixed number of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says that exactly 2 of the 7 statements are false. This means we have exactly 5 true statements, as there are 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply having exactly 5 true statements, they essentially convey the same information regarding the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 8: Combine Information\nFrom Statement 3 and Statement 4, we have a scenario where exactly 5 statements are true. This aligns with Statement 6, as 5 is a prime number. For Statement 7, having 2 false statements (which is not composite) doesn't fit, but we must consider all statements together for consistency.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Consistency\nStatement 5 suggests that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. However, both lead to the same outcome (5 true statements), which is consistent with Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) but contradicts Statement 7 (since 2 false statements are not composite).\n\n## Step 10: Consider Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 requires at least 2 true statements.\n- Statement 2 allows for up to 4 false statements (thus, at least 3 true statements).\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 both suggest exactly 5 true statements, which aligns with Statement 6.\n- Statement 5 indicates only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, but they imply the same number of true statements.\n- Statement 7 requires a composite number of false statements, which doesn't fit with 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 11: Determine Valid Solutions\nGiven the analysis, the only scenario that fits all conditions (especially considering the prime number of true statements and the constraints from Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) is having exactly 5 true statements. This means Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true, as per Statement 5, but they both suggest the same number of true statements. Statement 7's requirement for a composite number of false statements is not met in this scenario (since 2 is not composite), indicating a potential inconsistency in the statements as given.\n\n## Step 12: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and analyzing each statement, the scenario that best fits the conditions provided, especially with Statements 3, 4, and 6 being key, suggests that there should be exactly 5 true statements for the conditions to be met as closely as possible. However, this creates a contradiction with Statement 7, indicating an issue with the statements' consistency.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that at least 3 of the 7 statements are true. This means the number of true statements can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 0 of the 7 statements are false, which implies all statements must be true. However, this seems to contradict the nature of self-referential paradoxes often found in such puzzles, as it's rare for all statements in a set like this to be true due to the constraints they impose on each other.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims exactly 4 of the statements are true. This gives a specific condition that can be tested against other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 3 of the statements are false, which means exactly 4 are true. This statement is equivalent to Statement 3 in terms of the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, since Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (exactly 4 statements are true), Statement 5 creates a paradox if either 3 or 4 is considered true because they cannot be true at the same time without violating the conditions of Statement 5.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible numbers of true statements according to Statement 6 are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies the possible numbers of false statements are 4 or 6, meaning 3 or 1 statements are true, respectively.\n\n## Step 8: Compare Statements for Consistency\n- Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true due to Statement 5, but they say the same thing, creating a conflict.\n- Statement 2 cannot be true because if all statements were true, it would violate the conditions set by other statements, especially considering the constraints imposed by Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n- Statement 6 allows for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 7 suggests 3 or 1 true statements (since 4 or 6 false statements imply 3 or 1 true statements, respectively).\n\n## Step 9: Determine Possible Solutions\nConsidering the constraints:\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), this satisfies Statement 1 and could potentially satisfy Statement 6 (since 4 is not a prime, this actually doesn't satisfy Statement 6).\n- Statement 5's condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both is problematic since they convey the same information.\n- The only prime number of true statements that also satisfies Statement 1 and could fit with the other constraints (given the limitations) is 3 true statements, which would mean 4 false statements, satisfying Statement 7 (since 4 is composite).\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and analyzing each statement against the others, the solution must satisfy multiple conditions simultaneously without contradiction. The statements impose strict conditions, but due to the nature of these puzzles, we look for a set of true statements that does not lead to a paradox.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means the number of true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 2 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7, since having 5 true statements means 2 are false, having 6 true means 1 is false, and having 7 true means none are false.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 5 of the 7 statements are true. This directly specifies the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 6 of the 7 statements are false. This means only 1 statement is true, which contradicts the implications of Statements 1, 2, and 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the contradiction between Statement 3 and Statement 4, this statement helps to narrow down the possibilities but must be considered in conjunction with the others.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible number of true statements, according to this statement, could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that the number of false statements could be 4 (meaning 3 true statements) or 6 (meaning 1 true statement), but since 2 is a prime number and having 2 false statements (5 true) fits with some previous conditions, it's also a possibility to consider in the context of all statements.\n\n## Step 8: Considering the Intersection of Conditions\nGiven the conditions, Statement 4 cannot be true because it contradicts the minimum requirement of true statements set by Statement 1 and the specific number set by Statement 3. Statement 3, claiming exactly 5 true statements, aligns with Statement 1 (at least 4 true), Statement 2 (at most 2 false), and Statement 6 (prime number of true statements, since 5 is prime). Statement 5 supports the exclusivity between Statement 3 and Statement 4, making Statement 3 a potential truth given its alignment with other statements.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Statement 5's Impact\nSince Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and given that Statement 4 leads to a contradiction with the majority of the statements, Statement 3 being true seems plausible. If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 10: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements, the most consistent scenario is where Statement 3 is true, indicating exactly 5 true statements. This aligns with the prime number condition (Statement 6) and does not contradict the at least 4 true statements (Statement 1) or the at most 2 false statements (Statement 2). Given this, we can determine the number of possible solutions based on which statements can be true or false while satisfying all given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",
