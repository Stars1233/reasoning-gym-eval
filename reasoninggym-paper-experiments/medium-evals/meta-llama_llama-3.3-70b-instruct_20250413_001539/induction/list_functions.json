Input 4: [31, 36, 77, 87, 4, 5, 77, 92]\nOutput 4: [77]\n\n\nFrom the examples, we can observe that the output seems to be the element that appears only once or is unique in some way, but this doesn't hold for all examples given. However, looking closer:\n\n\n- In Input 1, 33 is the smallest number.\n- In Input 2, 81 is the largest number.\n- In Input 3, 17 is the smallest number.\n- In Input 4, 77 is repeated, which doesn't fit the initial observation of uniqueness, but it's actually about being the first repeated number or another pattern.\n\n\nGiven the inconsistency with the uniqueness or size (smallest/largest) alone, let's consider another angle: the presence of repeated numbers or unique identifiers within the sequences.\n\n\nUpon reevaluation, the correct pattern seems elusive based on the provided examples, as they don't clearly indicate a single rule (like smallest, largest, first, last, unique, or repeated) that applies universally across all given inputs and outputs.\n\n\nHowever, considering the possibility that the examples might be hinting at a different kind of pattern, such as the first number that meets a certain condition (like being odd, even, smallest, largest, etc.), let's reassess:\n\n\nIf we consider the numbers provided in the outputs, there's no clear mathematical operation or selection criterion (such as min, max, median, mode) that consistently applies. The examples provided do not clearly illustrate a consistent rule for selecting the output based on standard mathematical operations or properties (odd/even, prime, etc.).\n\n\nGiven the provided examples and the task to apply inductive reasoning, without a clear, identifiable pattern that fits all examples (such as always selecting the smallest, the first even, the last odd, etc.), the problem as stated does not provide enough information to deduce a logical rule that applies to all cases.\n\n\nThus, based on the information given and the attempt to find a pattern, the problem does not clearly define a rule that can be applied universally across different inputs to predict the output accurately.\n\n\nGiven this, and to follow the instructions precisely without further clarification or a discernible pattern:\n\n\n<answer>[79]</answer>",

However, let's consider another angle:\n\n- In **Input 1**, all numbers are increasing, but the pattern of increase isn't consistent.\n- In **Input 2**, the sequence decreases, but again, not in a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence.\n- In **Input 3**, the numbers increase, but with varying differences.\n- In **Input 4**, the sequence decreases, with one instance of equality at the end.\n\nConsidering the outputs:\n- **Output 1** is [1] for an increasing sequence with varying differences.\n- **Output 2** is [0] for a decreasing sequence.\n- **Output 3** is [1] for an increasing sequence with varying differences.\n- **Output 4** is [0] for a decreasing sequence with an instance of equality.\n\nA possible rule could be related to whether the sequence is generally increasing or decreasing, but this doesn't account for all variations. Given the examples, another approach is to look at the first and last elements and their relationship or the overall trend:\n\n- If the sequence ends higher than it starts (generally increasing), the output is [1].\n- If the sequence ends lower than or equal to where it starts (generally decreasing or stays the same), the output is [0].\n\nApplying this rule to the given input:\n**Input:** [9, 13, 14, 50, 80, 94]\n\nThe sequence starts at 9 and ends at 94, which means it ends higher than it starts.

In other words, if we look at each number in the input list and compare it with its previous number, the numbers that are greater than their predecessors are selected for the output list.\n\nApplying this rule to the given input: [85, 56, 1, 71, 26, 85, 21]\n\n- Start with the first number: 85. Since it's the first, it's included by default.\n- Compare 56 with 85: 56 is less than 85, so it's not included.\n- Compare 1 with 56: 1 is less than 56, so it's not included.\n- Compare 71 with 1: 71 is greater than 1, so it's included.\n- Compare 26 with 71: 26 is less than 71, so it's not included.\n- Compare 85 with 26: 85 is greater than 26, so it's included.\n- Compare 21 with 85: 21 is less than 85, so it's not included.\n\nThus, applying the rule to the input [85, 56, 1, 71, 26, 85, 21], we get the output: [85, 71, 85]\n\n<answer>[85, 71, 85]</answer>",

Since 10 is an even number, this could be another clue.\nFor Input 3: [795], the sum of the digits is 7+9+5 = 21. Since 21 is an odd number, it follows the pattern of Input 1.\nFor Input 4: [570], the sum of the digits is 5+7+0 = 12. Since 12 is an even number, it follows the pattern of Input 2.\n\n\nBased on this observation, the rule seems to be that if the sum of the digits of the input number is odd, the output is [0], and if the sum of the digits is even, the output is [1].\n\n\nApplying this rule to the input [845]:\n- The sum of the digits is 8+4+5 = 17.\n- Since 17 is an odd number, according to the identified rule, the output should be [0].\n\n\n<answer>[0]</answer>",

Input 4: [8, 84, 73, 68]\n   Output 4: [0]\n   - Similar to Input 2, there are no repeating numbers.\n\nFrom these examples, it seems the output could be related to the count of repeating numbers or a specific pattern. However, the exact rule isn't immediately clear from the provided examples. Let's consider another approach:\n\n- If we look at the outputs, they seem to represent counts or indices, but without a clear pattern related to the inputs provided, we might need to consider the presence of specific numbers or their frequencies.\n\nGiven the input: [5, 5, 42, 12, 63, 10, 91, 64, 92]\n\n- The number 5 repeats, which could be a key factor based on the first example.\n\nConsidering the need for a clear rule and the provided examples, if the task is to identify a repeating number or a count related to such a pattern, the output for the given input, based on the repeating number 5, could logically be related to its frequency or presence. However, the exact rule from the examples isn't straightforward without additional context or a clearer pattern.\n\nGiven the direct information and trying to apply a logical deduction based on the examples:\n\n<answer>[2]</answer>",
