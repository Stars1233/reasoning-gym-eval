The third differences are: -8, 8, 0, 8, 8. This sequence suggests a pattern where the differences alternate between 8 and -8, with a zero in between.\n\n5. To find the next difference in the original sequence, we add the last difference (64) to the next expected difference in the pattern (which is 8):\n   - 64 + 8 = 72\n\n6.
