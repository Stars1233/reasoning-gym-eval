Therefore, Michael was 4*24=96 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.\n\nComet Encke orbits the sun every 55 years. The time difference between the two sightings of the comet by Michael and his uncle is 55 years.\n\nTherefore, Michael was 96-55=41 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.\n\n<answer>41</answer>",
