Continue this process for all vertices.\n\nLet's apply this step-by-step:\n\n- Vertex 0: Assign color 1.\n- Vertex 1: Neighbors are 13 and 18. Assign color 2.\n- Vertex 2: Neighbors are 5 and 18. Assign color 3.\n- Vertex 3: Neighbors are 1, 5, 13, and 14. Assign color 4.\n- Vertex 4: Neighbors are 6, 7, and 17. Assign color 2.\n- Vertex 5: Neighbors are 2, 3, and 17. Assign color 1.\n- Vertex 6: Neighbors are 4, 8, and 12. Assign color 3.\n- Vertex 7: Neighbors are 4. Assign color 1.\n- Vertex 8: Neighbors are 6. Assign color 2.\n- Vertex 9: No neighbors. Assign color 1.\n- Vertex 10: Neighbors are 11. Assign color 2.\n- Vertex 11: Neighbors are 10. Assign color 1.\n- Vertex 12: Neighbors are 6. Assign color 4.\n- Vertex 13: Neighbors are 1, 3, 9, and 14. Assign color 3.\n- Vertex 14: Neighbors are 0, 3, and 13. Assign color 2.\n- Vertex 15: No neighbors. Assign color 1.\n- Vertex 16: No neighbors. Assign color 1.\n- Vertex 17: Neighbors are 3, 4, and 5. Assign color 2.\n- Vertex 18: Neighbors are 1, 2. Assign color 4.\n\n<answer>\n{\n  \"0\": 1,\n  \"1\": 2,\n  \"2\": 3,\n  \"3\": 4,\n  \"4\": 2,\n  \"5\": 1,\n  \"6\": 3,\n  \"7\": 1,\n  \"8\": 2,\n  \"9\": 1,\n  \"10\": 2,\n  \"11\": 1,\n  \"12\": 4,\n  \"13\": 3,\n  \"14\": 2,\n  \"15\": 1,\n  \"16\": 1,\n  \"17\": 2,\n  \"18\": 4\n}\n</answer>",

For each subsequent vertex, assign the smallest color that is not used by its adjacent vertices.\n\nLet's apply this process to the given graph:\n\n- Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]\n- Edges: [(0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 5), (3, 6), (3, 10), (4, 9), (6, 8), (7, 10)]\n\nFirst, let's determine the degree of each vertex:\n- Degree of 0: 2 (connected to 6 and 7)\n- Degree of 1: 1 (connected to 5)\n- Degree of 2: 0 (no connections)\n- Degree of 3: 2 (connected to 6 and 10)\n- Degree of 4: 1 (connected to 9)\n- Degree of 5: 1 (connected to 1)\n- Degree of 6: 3 (connected to 0, 3, and 8)\n- Degree of 7: 2 (connected to 0 and 10)\n- Degree of 8: 1 (connected to 6)\n- Degree of 9: 1 (connected to 4)\n- Degree of 10: 2 (connected to 3 and 7)\n- Degree of 11: 0 (no connections)\n\nSort the vertices by degree in descending order:\n[6, 0, 3, 7, 10, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 2, 11]\n\nNow, assign colors:\n- Vertex 6: Assign color 1\n- Vertex 0: Connected to 6 (color 1), assign color 2\n- Vertex 3: Connected to 6 (color 1), assign color 2\n- Vertex 7: Connected to 0 (color 2), assign color 1\n- Vertex 10: Connected to 3 (color 2) and 7 (color 1), assign color 3\n- Vertex 1: Connected to 5 (no color yet), assign color 1\n- Vertex 4: Connected to 9 (no color yet), assign color 1\n- Vertex 5: Connected to 1 (color 1), assign color 2\n- Vertex 8: Connected to 6 (color 1), assign color 2\n- Vertex 9: Connected to 4 (color 1), assign color 2\n- Vertex 2: No connections, assign color 1\n- Vertex 11: No connections, assign color 1\n\nThus, the coloring is:\n<answer>{\"0\": 2, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2, \"10\": 3, \"11\": 1}</answer>",
