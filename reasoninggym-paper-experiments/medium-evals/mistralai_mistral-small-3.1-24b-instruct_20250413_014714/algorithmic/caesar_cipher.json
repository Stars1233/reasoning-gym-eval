A Caesar cipher typically shifts letters by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.\n2. Determine the most likely shift by analyzing the frequency of letters or by trying common shifts.\n3. Decrypt the text using the identified shift.\n\nAfter analyzing the text and trying common shifts, I find that a shift of 3 positions to the left deciphers the text correctly.\n\n<answer>WALK THIS WAY I WILL BE YOUR GUIDE I WILL BE BY YOUR SIDE</answer>",
