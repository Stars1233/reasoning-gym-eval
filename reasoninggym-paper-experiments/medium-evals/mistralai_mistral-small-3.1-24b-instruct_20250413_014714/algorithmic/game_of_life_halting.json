Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nGiven the initial board is entirely filled with dead cells (all zeros), there are no live cells to begin with. Therefore, according to the rules of the Game of Life, the state of the board will remain the same in every subsequent step.\n\n<answer>True</answer>",
