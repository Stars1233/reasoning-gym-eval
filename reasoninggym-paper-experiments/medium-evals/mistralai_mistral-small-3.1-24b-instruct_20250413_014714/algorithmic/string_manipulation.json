If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.\n2. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n3. If the string contains an even number of 'b's (and at least one 'b'), append 'ab' at the end.\n4. If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n5. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n6. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n7. If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.\n8. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\naaaacbbcbbbcbcbccbabbabbaaabaccccaaabccabccbaaaaaaaababcacbcbccbabacabbcbacbcccbabcacbacbbbbb\n",

If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.\n2. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n3. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n4. If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.\n5. If the string length is greater than 15, remove the middle character.\n6. If the string prefix is 'cb', replace it with 'aa' and delete the last character.\n7. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nbcbaacbaabbcaabcaabacbbbabaaabcbacbccbbbbcbcbabbacabaaabaca\n",
