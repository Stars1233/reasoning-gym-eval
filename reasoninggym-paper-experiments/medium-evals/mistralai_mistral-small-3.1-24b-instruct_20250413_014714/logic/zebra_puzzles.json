Since House 1 is the mother of Billy and pizza lover, House 1 cannot be Arnold.\n10. From clue 6, the Chinese is the person who loves a carnations arrangement. Since House 1 is the pizza lover, House 1 cannot be the Chinese person.\n11. From clue 4, the German loves eating grilled cheese. Since House 3 is the German, House 1 cannot be the German.\n12. From clue 10, Bob loves the boquet of orchid. Since House 1 is the pizza lover, House 1 cannot be Bob.\n13. From clue 1, the Dane is Carol. Since House 2 is Carol, House 1 cannot be the Dane.\n14. From clue 15, Bob is directly left of the person who loves the boquet of lilies. Since House 1 is the pizza lover, House 1 cannot be Bob.\n15.

Since Bob cannot be in the third or fourth house (already occupied), and cannot be in the second house (loves orchid), Bob must be in the fifth house.\n11. From clue 6, the person who loves white and the person who loves stir fry are next to each other. Therefore, the person who loves stir fry is in the fourth house (Alice).\n12. From clue 11, Alice is the person who loves the soup. This is a contradiction with the previous step, so we need to re-evaluate. Since Alice is in the fourth house and loves stir fry, the person who loves soup must be in the fifth house (Bob).\n13. From clue 13, the person who loves eating grilled cheese is directly left of the person who loves yellow. Since the person who loves grilled cheese is in the third house, the person who loves yellow is in the fourth house (Alice).\n14. From clue 1, the person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the person who is a pizza lover. Since Alice is in the fourth house and loves stir fry, the person who loves pizza must be in the fifth house (Bob).\n15. From clue 3, the person who loves brown is the bird keeper. Since Bob is in the fifth house and loves white, the person who loves brown must be in the second house.\n16. From clue 10, the person who loves the bouquet of orchid is in the second house. Therefore, the person in the second house loves the bouquet of orchid and brown, and keeps birds.\n17. The only remaining name is David.

From clue 4, Arnold is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of orchid. Therefore, Arnold is in the first house.\n3. From clue 12, the cat lover is directly left of the person who loves the bouquet of iris. Since the person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the fourth house (clue 16), the cat lover must be in the third house.\n4. From clue 14, the person who loves purple is the person who loves eating grilled cheese. Since the person who loves purple keeps horses (clue 8), the person in the third house loves purple, eats grilled cheese, and keeps horses.\n5. From clue 9, the person who loves a carnations arrangement is the person who loves eating grilled cheese. Therefore, the person in the third house also loves carnations.\n6. From clue 15, the person who loves eating grilled cheese is directly left of Alice. Therefore, Alice is in the fourth house.\n7. From clue 16, the person who loves the bouquet of iris is in the fourth house. Therefore, Alice loves the bouquet of iris.\n8. From clue 2, the person who loves spaghetti is Carol. Since the fish enthusiast is the person who loves spaghetti (clue 7), Carol keeps fish.\n9. From clue 3, the person who loves brown is the bird keeper. Since Carol is in the fourth house and loves the bouquet of iris, Carol does not love brown. Therefore, Carol does not keep birds.\n10. From clue 5, Bob is the person who loves white. Since Bob cannot be in the third or fourth house (already occupied), and cannot be in the second house (loves orchid), Bob must be in the fifth house.\n11. From clue 6, the person who loves white and the person who loves stir fry are next to each other. Therefore, the person who loves stir fry is in the fourth house (Alice).\n12. From clue 11, Alice is the person who loves the soup. This is a contradiction with the previous step, so we need to re-evaluate. Since Alice is in the fourth house and loves stir fry, the person who loves soup must be in the fifth house (Bob).\n13. From clue 13, the person who loves eating grilled cheese is directly left of the person who loves yellow. Since the person who loves grilled cheese is in the third house, the person who loves yellow is in the fourth house (Alice).\n14. From clue 1, the person who loves the bouquet of lilies is the person who is a pizza lover. Since Alice is in the fourth house and loves stir fry, the person who loves pizza must be in the fifth house (Bob).\n15. From clue 3, the person who loves brown is the bird keeper. Since Bob is in the fifth house and loves white, the person who loves brown must be in the second house.\n16. From clue 10, the person who loves the bouquet of orchid is in the second house. Therefore, the person in the second house loves the bouquet of orchid and brown, and keeps birds.\n17. The only remaining name is David. Therefore, David is in the second house and loves the bouquet of orchid and brown, and keeps birds.\n18. The only remaining animal is the dog. Therefore, Arnold keeps the dog.\n\n<answer>arnold</answer>",
