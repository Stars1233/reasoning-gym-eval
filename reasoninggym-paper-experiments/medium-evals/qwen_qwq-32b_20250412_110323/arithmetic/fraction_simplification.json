Divide 1302 by 93, which gives a remainder of 0.\n\nThe last non-zero remainder is 93, so the GCD of 17298 and 30597 is 93.\n\nNext, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (93):\n\n- Numerator: \\(17298 \\div 93 = 186\\)\n- Denominator: \\(30597 \\div 93 = 329\\)\n\nThe simplified fraction is \\(\\dfrac{186}{329}\\). Checking the GCD of 186 and 329 confirms it is 1, so the fraction is in its lowest terms.\n\n<answer>\\boxed{\\dfrac{186}{329}}</answer>",
