Following this pattern and keeping track of all moves...\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n</answer>",

Moving from Peg 3 to Peg 2 means:\n   - Source: Peg 3\n   - Auxiliary: Peg 1\n   - Destination: Peg 2\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 7 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll use the recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi\n2. For 8 disks, we need 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves\n3. The pattern follows:\n   - Move disks 1-7 from source to auxiliary\n   - Move disk 8 from source to destination\n   - Move disks 1-7 from auxiliary to destination\n4. This pattern repeats recursively for smaller subsets of disks\n5. Starting from Peg 3 (source) to Peg 1 (destination), using Peg 2 as auxiliary\n6.

          "full_model_response": "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll use the recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi\n2. For 8 disks, we need 2^8 - 1 = 255 moves\n3. The pattern follows:\n   - Move disks 1-7 from source to auxiliary\n   - Move disk 8 from source to destination\n   - Move disks 1-7 from auxiliary to destination\n4. This pattern repeats recursively for smaller subsets of disks\n5. Starting from Peg 3 (source) to Peg 1 (destination), using Peg 2 as auxiliary\n6.

      "best_full_model_response": "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll recall that for n disks, it takes 2^n - 1 moves (255 moves for 8 disks)\n2. For moving from Peg 3 to Peg 2:\n   - First move 7 disks to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary)\n   - Move largest disk to Peg 2\n   - Move 7 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 3 as auxiliary)\n3.

I'll calculate all moves following the rules\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 7 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n</answer>",

For 9 disks, we need to:\n   - Move 8 disks to auxiliary peg\n   - Move largest disk to destination\n   - Move 8 disks from auxiliary to destination\n3. This pattern repeats for smaller subsets of disks\n4. Starting from Peg 2, destination is Peg 1, so Peg 3 will be auxiliary\n5.
