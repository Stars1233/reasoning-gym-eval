      "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.\n2. If the string starts with 'cc', remove the first two characters.\n3. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n4. If the string contains 'acb', replace the first occurrence with its reverse ('bca').\n5. If the string ends with 'ba', replace it with 'ab'.\n6. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n7. If the string contains 'abc', replace the first occurrence with 'cab'.\n8. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nYour output should be the final transformed string after applying all the rules.\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nbbbbcabcaacabacbccaacababccaaccaaccbbcbbcaaaabcbaacacabbabababbabccccaacacbcba\n",
