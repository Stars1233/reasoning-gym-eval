The sum of the interior angles of a 13-sided polygon is $(13-2) \\times 180 = 11 \\times 180 = 1980$.\nThe sum of the given 12 angles is $78 + 103 + 72 + 131 + 94 + 31 + 147 + 91 + 67 + 152 + 31 + 49 = 1046$.\nThe 13th angle is $1980 - 1046 = 934$. However, this is impossible for a convex polygon since each angle must be less than 180 degrees.\n\nThe sum of the first 12 angles is $78 + 103 + 72 + 131 + 94 + 31 + 147 + 91 + 67 + 152 + 31 + 49 = 1046$.\nThe sum of the interior angles of a 13-sided polygon is $(13-2) \\times 180 = 11 \\times 180 = 1980$.\nLet the 13th angle be $x$. Then $1046 + x = 1980$, so $x = 1980 - 1046 = 934$.\nSince the polygon is convex, each interior angle must be less than 180 degrees. This is impossible.\n\nHowever, if we assume the given angles are correct, we can still calculate the 13th angle.\nThe sum of the interior angles of a 13-sided polygon is $(13-2) \\times 180 = 11 \\times 180 = 1980$.\nThe sum of the first 12 angles is $78 + 103 + 72 + 131 + 94 + 31 + 147 + 91 + 67 + 152 + 31 + 49 = 1046$.\nThe 13th angle is $1980 - 1046 = 934$.\n\nSince the problem states that the polygon is convex, we need to ensure that all angles are less than 180. However, we got 934, which is greater than 180.
