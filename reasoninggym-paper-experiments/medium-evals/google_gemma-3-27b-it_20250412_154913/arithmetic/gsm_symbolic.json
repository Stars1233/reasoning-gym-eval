So, he has 2 * 85 = 170 grape.\n2. **Total corn after buying:** Allan bought 71 corn, so he now has 85 + 71 = 156 corn.\n3. **Grape bought:** Allan bought 40 fewer grape than the 71 corn he bought, so he bought 71 - 40 = 31 grape.\n4. **Total grape after buying:** Allan initially had 170 grape and bought 31 more, so he now has 170 + 31 = 201 grape.\n5. **Combined total:** The combined total of grape and corn is 201 + 156 = 357.\n\n<answer>357</answer>",
