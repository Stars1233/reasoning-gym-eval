This means either $T=4$ and $F \\ne 3$ or $T \\ne 4$ and $F=3$.\nIf $T=4$, then $F = 7-4 = 3$. But Statement 5 says that $T=4$ and $F=3$ cannot both be true. Therefore, $T \\ne 4$ and $F=3$.\nSince $F=3$, we have $T = 7-3 = 4$. But this contradicts the fact that $T \\ne 4$.

This contradicts $T \\ne 4$.\n\nSo we have a contradiction. Let's re-examine the statements.\nWe have $T \\ge 4$ (Statement 1) and $F \\le 1$ (Statement 2). Since $T+F=7$, we have $T \\ge 4$ and $7-T \\le 1$, so $T \\ge 6$. Thus, $T \\in \\{6, 7\\}$.\nWe have $T=4$ (Statement 3) and $F=3$ (Statement 4). These contradict each other.\nStatement 5 says exactly one of Statement 3 and Statement 4 is true. So either $T=4$ and $F \\ne 3$, or $T \\ne 4$ and $F=3$.\nStatement 6 says $T$ is prime.

But Statement 5 says that exactly one of $T=4$ and $F=3$ is true, which is a contradiction. So $T \\ne 4$.\nIf $F=3$, then $T=4$. But Statement 5 says that exactly one of $T=4$ and $F=3$ is true, which is a contradiction. So $F \\ne 3$.\n\nSince $T \\ge 6$, let $T=6$. Then $F=1$.\n$T=6$ is prime, and $F=1$ is not composite. So this is impossible.\nLet $T=7$. Then $F=0$.\n$T=7$ is prime, and $F=0$ is not composite. So this is impossible.\n\nLet's assume Statement 3 is true, so $T=4$. Then $F=3$. But Statement 5 says that only one of Statement 3 and Statement 4 is true. So Statement 4 is false. Thus $F \\ne 3$. This is a contradiction.\nLet's assume Statement 4 is true, so $F=3$. Then $T=4$. But Statement 5 says that only one of Statement 3 and Statement 4 is true. So Statement 3 is false. Thus $T \\ne 4$.

This is false since $F = 0$.\nStatement 5: Exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.

Then Statement 6 is false, Statement 7 is true.\nIf $T = 5$, $F = 2$. Then Statement 6 is true, Statement 7 is false.\n\nThe only possible solution is when $T=4, F=3$.\nStatement 1: False\nStatement 2: True\nStatement 3: False\nStatement 4: False\nStatement 5: False\nStatement 6: False\nStatement 7: False\nThis gives 1 true statement, which is a contradiction.\n\nThere are no possible solutions.\n\n</answer>0</answer>",

Thus, Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\nStatement 5 says that exactly one of Statement 3 and Statement 4 is true.\n\nIf Statement 3 is true, then $T = 6$ and $F = 1$.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then $T = 2$ and $F = 5$.\n\nStatement 6 says $T$ is prime.\nStatement 7 says $F$ is composite.\n\nCase 1: Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n$T = 6$ and $F = 1$.\n$T$ is prime, so 6 is prime, which is false.\n$F$ is composite, so 1 is composite, which is false.\nSo this case is impossible.\n\nCase 2: Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n$T = 2$ and $F = 5$.\n$T$ is prime, so 2 is prime, which is true.\n$F$ is composite, so 5 is composite, which is false.\nSo this case is impossible.\n\nHowever, let's re-examine the statements.\nStatement 1: $T \\geq 6$\nStatement 2: $F \\leq 1$\nStatement 3: $T = 6$\nStatement 4: $F = 5$\nStatement 5: Exactly one of Statement 3 and Statement 4 is true.\nStatement 6: $T$ is prime.\nStatement 7: $F$ is composite.\n\nIf Statement 3 is true, then $T = 6$ and $F = 1$.

Then $T \\geq 6$ (false), $F \\leq 1$ (false), $T = 6$ (false), $F = 5$ (true), $T$ is prime (true), $F$ is composite (true).\n\nSince exactly one of Statement 3 and Statement 4 is true, we consider two cases.\nCase 1: Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false. Then $T = 6$ and $F = 1$.\nStatement 1: $T \\geq 6$, so $6 \\geq 6$ (true).\nStatement 2: $F \\leq 1$, so $1 \\leq 1$ (true).\nStatement 3: $T = 6$, so $6 = 6$ (true).\nStatement 4: $F = 5$, so $1 = 5$ (false).\nStatement 5: Exactly one is true, so Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false (true).\nStatement 6: $T$ is prime, so 6 is prime (false).\nStatement 7: $F$ is composite, so 1 is composite (false).\nSince Statement 6 and Statement 7 are false, this case is impossible.\n\nCase 2: Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false. Then $T = 2$ and $F = 5$.\nStatement 1: $T \\geq 6$, so $2 \\geq 6$ (false).\nStatement 2: $F \\leq 1$, so $5 \\leq 1$ (false).\nStatement 3: $T = 6$, so $2 = 6$ (false).\nStatement 4: $F = 5$, so $5 = 5$ (true).\nStatement 5: Exactly one is true, so Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false (true).\nStatement 6: $T$ is prime, so 2 is prime (true).\nStatement 7: $F$ is composite, so 5 is composite (false).\nSince Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 7 are false, this case is impossible.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the conditions.\n$T \\geq 6$ and $F \\leq 1$ implies $T = 6, 7$ and $F = 0, 1$.\n$T = 6$ and $F = 1$ implies $T \\geq 6$ and $F \\leq 1$.\n$T = 2$ and $F = 5$ implies $T \\geq 6$ is false and $F \\leq 1$ is false.\nExactly one of $T = 6$ and $F = 5$ is true.\n$T$ is prime, $F$ is composite.\nIf $T = 6$, then $F = 1$. $T$ is not prime, $F$ is not composite.\nIf $T = 2$, then $F = 5$. $T$ is prime, $F$ is not composite.\n\nConsider $T = 6, F = 1$.\nThen statement 1 is true, statement 2 is true, statement 3 is true, statement 4 is false, statement 5 is true, statement 6 is false, statement 7 is false.\nThe number of true statements is 4.\n\nConsider $T = 2, F = 5$.\nThen statement 1 is false, statement 2 is false, statement 3 is false, statement 4 is true, statement 5 is true, statement 6 is true, statement 7 is false.\nThe number of true statements is 3.\n\nIf we assume the statements are about the statements themselves, then $T$ is the number of true statements and $F$ is the number of false statements. So $T + F = 7$.\nStatement 1: $T \\geq 6$\nStatement 2: $F \\leq 1$\nStatement 3: $T = 6$\nStatement 4: $F = 5$\nStatement 5: Exactly one of Statement 3 and Statement 4 is true.\nStatement 6: $T$ is prime.\nStatement 7: $F$ is composite.\n\nIf Statement 3 is true, then $T = 6$ and $F = 1$.\nThen $T \\geq 6$ is true, $F \\leq 1$ is true, $T = 6$ is true, $F = 5$ is false, exactly one is true is true, $T$ is prime is false, $F$ is composite is false.\nSo 6 true, 1 false. 4 statements are true.\n\nIf Statement 4 is true, then $T = 2$ and $F = 5$.\nThen $T \\geq 6$ is false, $F \\leq 1$ is false, $T = 6$ is false, $F = 5$ is true, exactly one is true is true, $T$ is prime is true, $F$ is composite is false.\nSo 2 true, 5 false. 3 statements are true.\n\nTherefore, there are 0 solutions.\n\n</answer>0</answer>",
