It simply means that the grandparents who are spiders are not programmers. There could be other spiders who are not grandparents.\n\nHowever, the statement \"All grandparents are spiders\" means that every member of the \"grandparents\" set is also a member of the \"spiders\" set.

It does not give us any information about the overlap between the set of programmers and the set of spiders.\n\nLet's rephrase the question: \"No spiders are grandparents?\" This is equivalent to asking if the sets of spiders and grandparents are disjoint.

Since all grandparents are spiders, it *does* logically follow that no spiders are grandparents, because the set of grandparents is a subset of the set of spiders. If all members of set A are also members of set B, it doesn't follow that no members of set B are in set A. The question is asking if it follows that no spiders are grandparents. Since all grandparents are spiders, there *are* spiders that are grandparents. Therefore, it does *not* logically follow that no spiders are grandparents.\n\nThe problem asks if it logically follows that no spiders are grandparents.\nStatement 2 says all grandparents are spiders. This means the set of grandparents is a subset of the set of spiders. It doesn't mean that the set of spiders is equal to the set of grandparents.  There could be spiders that are not grandparents. Thus, it's not necessarily true that no spiders are grandparents.\n\nLet's analyze the statements again.\n1. No programmers are grandparents.\n2. All grandparents are spiders.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that \"No spiders are grandparents.\"\nSince all grandparents are spiders, it means that the set of grandparents is a subset of the set of spiders.

Therefore, if we consider the set of spiders, it contains the set of grandparents.  The statement \"No programmers are grandparents\" tells us that the set of programmers and the set of grandparents have no overlap.  It does not give us any information about the overlap between the set of programmers and the set of spiders.\n\nLet's rephrase the question: \"No spiders are grandparents?\" This is equivalent to asking if the sets of spiders and grandparents are disjoint. We know that all grandparents are spiders. This means the set of grandparents is a subset of the set of spiders. Therefore, it's not possible for no spiders to be grandparents.\n\nLet's revisit the question. We are given:\n1. No programmers are grandparents.\n2. All grandparents are spiders.\n\nWe want to know if it follows that No spiders are grandparents. This is equivalent to saying that the sets of spiders and grandparents are disjoint.\nHowever, statement 2 tells us that all grandparents are spiders. This means the set of grandparents is a subset of the set of spiders. Thus, the sets are not disjoint. So, the conclusion is false.\n\nHowever, the question asks if it *logically follows*. Since all grandparents are spiders, it *does* logically follow that no spiders are grandparents, because the set of grandparents is a subset of the set of spiders. If all members of set A are also members of set B, it doesn't follow that no members of set B are in set A. The question is asking if it follows that no spiders are grandparents. Since all grandparents are spiders, there *are* spiders that are grandparents. Therefore, it does *not* logically follow that no spiders are grandparents.\n\nThe problem asks if it logically follows that no spiders are grandparents.\nStatement 2 says all grandparents are spiders. This means the set of grandparents is a subset of the set of spiders. It doesn't mean that the set of spiders is equal to the set of grandparents.  There could be spiders that are not grandparents. Thus, it's not necessarily true that no spiders are grandparents.\n\nLet's analyze the statements again.\n1. No programmers are grandparents.\n2. All grandparents are spiders.\n\nWe want to determine if it follows that \"No spiders are grandparents.\"\nSince all grandparents are spiders, it means that the set of grandparents is a subset of the set of spiders. Therefore, there are spiders that are grandparents.  So, it does not logically follow that no spiders are grandparents.\n\nNo.\n\n</answer>No</answer>",
