Matilda is one of them, so the number of other female colleagues Matilda has is 5 - 1 = 4.\n\nSince Matilda is a colleague of both Joseph and Jennifer, she must be in the intersection of their circles. The problem states that the people in Joseph's circle do not have other colleagues aside from those in the circle, except for Matilda who is also a colleague of Jennifer. This implies that the circles of Jennifer and Joseph overlap only through Matilda.\n\nJoseph has 8 female colleagues. Matilda is one of them. So, Matilda has 7 other female colleagues within Joseph's circle.\nJennifer has 5 female colleagues. Matilda is one of them. So, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues within Jennifer's circle.\nSince Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and Joseph, she has 7 + 4 = 11 colleagues.\nHowever, we are asked to find the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, she has 7 female colleagues from Joseph's circle and 4 female colleagues from Jennifer's circle. The total number of female colleagues is 7 + 4 = 11. But we have double-counted Matilda herself.\nSo, Matilda has 7 + 4 - 1 = 10 female colleagues. However, this is incorrect.\n\nSince Matilda is a colleague of Joseph, she is part of Joseph's circle. Joseph has 8 female colleagues. Matilda is one of them. Thus, Matilda has 8 - 1 = 7 female colleagues who are colleagues of Joseph.\nSince Matilda is a colleague of Jennifer, she is part of Jennifer's circle. Jennifer has 5 female colleagues. Matilda is one of them. Thus, Matilda has 5 - 1 = 4 female colleagues who are colleagues of Jennifer.\nSince Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and Joseph, the set of female colleagues of Matilda includes the female colleagues of Jennifer and the female colleagues of Joseph. However, Matilda is counted twice.\nSo, Matilda has 7 female colleagues from Joseph's circle and 4 female colleagues from Jennifer's circle. The total number of female colleagues is 7 + 4 = 11.\nHowever, Matilda is counted twice. So, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 7 + 4 - 1 = 10.\n\nLet's consider the female colleagues of Joseph. There are 8. Matilda is one of them.

So, Jennifer's total number of colleagues is 9 + 5 = 14.\n2. Joseph has 8 male colleagues and 8 female colleagues. So, Joseph's total number of colleagues is 8 + 8 = 16.\n3. Matilda is a colleague of both Joseph and Jennifer. This means Matilda is part of both Jennifer's and Joseph's circles of colleagues.\n4. The people in Joseph's circle (excluding Matilda) only have colleagues within that circle.\n5. We need to find the number of female colleagues Matilda has.\n\nSince Matilda is a colleague of Joseph, she is part of Joseph's circle. Joseph has 8 female colleagues.

Matilda is also part of Jennifer's circle.\n\nSince Matilda is a colleague of Joseph, she is among the 8 female colleagues of Joseph.\nSince Matilda is a colleague of Jennifer, she is among the 5 female colleagues of Jennifer.\n\nLet $F_J$ be the set of female colleagues of Jennifer, and $F_Jo$ be the set of female colleagues of Joseph. We know $|F_J| = 5$ and $|F_{Jo}| = 8$. Matilda is in both sets, so Matilda $\\in F_J \\cap F_{Jo}$.\n\nWe want to find the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is in Joseph's circle, her colleagues are Joseph's colleagues. Joseph has 8 female colleagues. Matilda is one of them, so the number of other female colleagues Matilda has is 8 - 1 = 7.\n\nHowever, we also know Matilda is in Jennifer's circle, which has 5 female colleagues. Matilda is one of them, so the number of other female colleagues Matilda has is 5 - 1 = 4.\n\nSince Matilda is a colleague of both Joseph and Jennifer, she must be in the intersection of their circles. The problem states that the people in Joseph's circle do not have other colleagues aside from those in the circle, except for Matilda who is also a colleague of Jennifer. This implies that the circles of Jennifer and Joseph overlap only through Matilda.\n\nJoseph has 8 female colleagues. Matilda is one of them.

So, Matilda has 4 other female colleagues within Jennifer's circle.\nSince Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and Joseph, she has 7 + 4 = 11 colleagues.\nHowever, we are asked to find the number of female colleagues Matilda has. Since Matilda is part of both circles, she has 7 female colleagues from Joseph's circle and 4 female colleagues from Jennifer's circle. The total number of female colleagues is 7 + 4 = 11. But we have double-counted Matilda herself.\nSo, Matilda has 7 + 4 - 1 = 10 female colleagues. However, this is incorrect.\n\nSince Matilda is a colleague of Joseph, she is part of Joseph's circle. Joseph has 8 female colleagues. Matilda is one of them. Thus, Matilda has 8 - 1 = 7 female colleagues who are colleagues of Joseph.\nSince Matilda is a colleague of Jennifer, she is part of Jennifer's circle. Jennifer has 5 female colleagues. Matilda is one of them. Thus, Matilda has 5 - 1 = 4 female colleagues who are colleagues of Jennifer.\nSince Matilda is a colleague of both Jennifer and Joseph, the set of female colleagues of Matilda includes the female colleagues of Jennifer and the female colleagues of Joseph. However, Matilda is counted twice.\nSo, Matilda has 7 female colleagues from Joseph's circle and 4 female colleagues from Jennifer's circle. The total number of female colleagues is 7 + 4 = 11.\nHowever, Matilda is counted twice. So, the number of female colleagues Matilda has is 7 + 4 - 1 = 10.\n\nLet's consider the female colleagues of Joseph. There are 8. Matilda is one of them. So, there are 7 other female colleagues of Joseph.\nLet's consider the female colleagues of Jennifer. There are 5. Matilda is one of them. So, there are 4 other female colleagues of Jennifer.\nMatilda is a colleague of both Joseph and Jennifer.

Since Matilda is one of William's colleagues, and Matilda is also part of Patricia's group, we need to determine how many female colleagues Matilda has.\n\nLet's denote the set of Patricia's colleagues as P and William's colleagues as W.
