Since the top-left 2x2 subgrid already has 3 and 4, the first cell must be 1 and the third cell must be 4. So, Row 0 becomes `1 2 4 3`.\n*   In Row 1, we have `3 4 _ 1`. The missing number is 2. So, Row 1 becomes `3 4 2 1`.\n*   In Row 2, we have `_ _ 3 2`.  The top-left 2x2 subgrid has 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, the first cell must be 4 and the second cell must be 1. So, Row 2 becomes `4 1 3 2`.\n*   In Row 3, we have `_ _ 1 _`. The missing numbers are 2, 3, and 4. From the last column, the last cell must be 4. So, Row 3 becomes `_ _ 1 4`.\n*   Now, let's look at Column 0. We have `1 3 4 _`. The missing number is 2. So, the last cell in Column 0 must be 2. Row 3 becomes `2 _ 1 4`.\n*   Now, let's look at Column 1. We have `2 4 1 _`. The missing number is 3. So, the last cell in Column 1 must be 3.

We need 2 and 4.\nSince the second row has 1 and 3, the first row must have 2 and 4.\nSo let's try a=2 and b=4.\nThe grid becomes:\n2 4 1 d\n1 3 2 4\n3 1 4 2\nf 4 3 g\n\nNow, the fourth row needs 1 and 2.\nSince the fourth column needs 3, we can try f=1 and g=2.\nThe grid becomes:\n2 4 1 d\n1 3 2 4\n3 1 4 2\n1 4 3 2\n\nNow, the fourth column needs 3. So d=3.\nThe grid becomes:\n2 4 1 3\n1 3 2 4\n3 1 4 2\n1 4 3 2\n\nLet's check the rows, columns, and 2x2 grids.\nRows: All correct.\nColumns: All correct.\n2x2 grids: All correct.\n\nTherefore, the solved puzzle is:\n\n2 4 1 3\n1 3 2 4\n3 1 4 2\n1 4 3 2\n<answer>2 4 1 3\n1 3 2 4\n3 1 4 2\n1 4 3 2</answer>",
