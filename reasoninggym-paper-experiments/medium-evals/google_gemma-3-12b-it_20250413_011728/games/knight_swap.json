Since A5 is out of bounds, and C1 is occupied by a black knight, and A1 is not a black knight's target position, it's not a valid first move.\n2. **w at B1:** It can move to A3, C3, D2, A1. A3 is occupied by a black knight, C3 is not a black knight's target, D2 is empty, and A1 is not a black knight's target.\n\nLet's try a different approach. We need to move the white knights to the black knights' original locations, and the black knights to the white knights' original locations.\n\n*   White knights need to go to A3, C1, D3.\n*   Black knights need to go to B3, B1.\n\nLet's examine the moves required:\n\n1.  **w at B3 -> D2:**  This is a possible move.\n2.  **w at B1 -> A3:** This is a possible move.\n3.  **B at A3 -> B2:** This is a possible move.\n4.  **B at C1 -> A2:** This is a possible move.\n\nNow we have:\n\n```\n    A   B   C   D\n   ----------------\n3 |   | w | . | w |\n   ----------------\n2 | B | . | B |   |\n   ----------------\n1 |   | w |   | B |\n   ----------------\n```\n\nThis doesn't seem to be leading anywhere useful. Let's consider the distances. The white knights need to move relatively far, while the black knights need to move closer.\n\nLet's try:\n1. w at B3 -> D2\n2. w at B1 -> A3\n3. B at A3 -> C2\n4.

Let's try another approach:\n1. w at B3 -> A1\n2. w at B1 -> C3\n3. B at A3 -> B2\n4. B at C1 -> A2\n\nThis doesn't seem to be working. The problem is quite complex.

Knights move in L-shape (2 squares + 1 square perpendicular)\n2. Knights can only move to empty squares\n3. w moves first, then players alternate\n4. All knights must reach their target positions (white \u2194 black)\n\nQuestion:\nIs it possible to swap all knights' positions? If yes, list the moves.\n\nAnswer Format:\n- For impossible puzzles: \"No\"\n- For possible puzzles: List moves as [\"color,from,to\", ...]\n  Example: [\"w,A1,B3\"] means white knight moves A1\u2192B3\n",
