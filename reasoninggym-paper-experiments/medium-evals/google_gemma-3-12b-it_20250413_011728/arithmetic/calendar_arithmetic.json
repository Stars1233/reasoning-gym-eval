So there are 10 Fridays in the 10 full weeks.\nNow we need to consider the extra 4 days.\nThe first day is May 28, which is a Saturday.\nThe next days are:\nMay 29: Sunday\nMay 30: Monday\nMay 31: Tuesday\nJune 1: Wednesday\nJune 2: Thursday\nJune 3: Friday\nSo the first Friday is June 3.\nThe remaining days are June 4, June 5, June 6.\nSince we have 4 days starting from Saturday, the days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.\nThe next Friday is June 10.\nThe Fridays are June 3, June 10, June 17, June 24, July 1, July 8, July 15, July 22, July 29, August 5.\nThe last Friday is August 5.\nSo the Fridays are June 3, 10, 17, 24, July 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, August 5.\nThere are 10 Fridays.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the day of the week for August 9, 2022.\nMay 28, 2022 is a Saturday.\nNumber of days from May 28 to August 9 is 74.\n$74 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$\nSo August 9, 2022 is Saturday + 4 days = Wednesday.\nThe Fridays in the interval are:\nJune 3, 10, 17, 24\nJuly 1, 8, 15, 22, 29\nAugust 5\nTotal number of Fridays is $4 + 5 + 1 = 10$.\n\n<answer>10</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days:** The period spans from September 21 to October 20, inclusive.\n   * September has 30 days. So, the number of days in September is 30 - 21 + 1 = 10 days.\n   * The number of days in October is 20 days.\n   * Total number of days = 10 + 20 = 30 days.\n\n2. **Determine the number of weekends:**\n   * We need to find the number of Saturdays and Sundays within this 30-day period.\n   * September 21, 2022, was a Wednesday.\n   * The first weekend starts on Saturday, September 24.\n   * The last weekend ends on Sunday, October 16.\n   * Number of full weekends = (October 16 - September 24) / 7 + 1 = 22 / 7 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 weekends.\n   * This gives us 4 * 2 = 8 weekend days.\n   * However, we need to check if there are any partial weekends at the beginning or end.\n   * September 24-25 is the first weekend.\n   * September 30 - October 1 is the fourth weekend.\n   * October 7-8 is the fifth weekend.\n   * October 14-15 is the sixth weekend.\n   * October 21-22 is the seventh weekend.\n   * Since the period ends on October 20, the last weekend is only partial.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of weekdays:**\n   * Number of weekdays = Total number of days - Number of weekend days.\n   * Number of weekend days = 8 weekend days.\n   * Number of weekdays = 30 - 8 = 22.\n\nHowever, let's re-examine the weekends.\nSeptember 21 is Wednesday.\nSeptember 24 is Saturday.\nSeptember 25 is Sunday.\nSeptember 30 is Friday.\nOctober 1 is Saturday.\nOctober 2 is Sunday.\nOctober 7 is Saturday.\nOctober 8 is Sunday.\nOctober 14 is Saturday.\nOctober 15 is Sunday.\nOctober 21 is Saturday.\nOctober 22 is Sunday.\n\nThe weekends are:\nSep 24-25\nSep 30-Oct 1\nOct 7-8\nOct 14-15\nTotal weekend days = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 days.\nWeekdays = 30 - 8 = 22 days.\n\nLet's list the days:\nSep 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri)\nOct 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Sat), 8 (Sun), 9 (Mon), 10 (Tue), 11 (Wed), 12 (Thu), 13 (Fri), 14 (Sat), 15 (Sun), 16 (Mon), 17 (Tue), 18 (Wed), 19 (Thu), 20 (Thu)\n\nWeekdays:\nSep 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\nOct 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20\nTotal weekdays = 10 + 12 = 22.\n\n<answer>22</answer>",
