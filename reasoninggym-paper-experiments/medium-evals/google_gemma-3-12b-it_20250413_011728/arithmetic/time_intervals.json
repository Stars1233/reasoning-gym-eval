Borrow 1 hour from the hours, so we have 2 hours.\nMinutes: 60 - 35 = 25\nSeconds: 14 - 9 = 5\nMilliseconds: 062 - 235 = -173.  Borrow 1 second from the seconds.\nSeconds: 4 - 1 = 3\nMilliseconds: 1000 - 173 = 827\nSo we have 02:54:03.827. But we borrowed an hour, so we should add it back.\nThe duration is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.\nSo the duration is 03:54:03.827.\n\nLet's calculate the difference:\n12:01:14.062\n- 09:36:09.235\n= 02:25:04.827\n\nThe start time is 09:36:09.235.\nThe end time is 12:01:14.062.\nThe difference in hours is 12 - 9 = 3.\nThe difference in minutes is 01 - 36 = -35. We need to borrow an hour, which is 60 minutes.\nSo we have 60 - 35 = 25 minutes.\nThe difference in seconds is 14 - 9 = 5.\nThe difference in milliseconds is 062 - 235 = -173. We need to borrow a second, which is 1000 milliseconds.\nSo we have 1000 - 173 = 827 milliseconds.\nWe borrowed 1 second, so we subtract 1 from the seconds.\nSo we have 4 - 1 = 3 seconds.\nSo the duration is 2 hours, 25 minutes, 3 seconds, and 827 milliseconds.\nHowever, we borrowed an hour initially, so the duration is actually 3 hours - 1 hour + 2 hours = 2 hours + 25 minutes + 3 seconds + 827 milliseconds.\nLet's recalculate.\n12:01:14.062 - 09:36:09.235 = 02:25:04.827\nWe need to calculate the duration from 09:36:09.235 to 12:01:14.062.\nHours: 12 - 9 = 3\nMinutes: 1 - 36 = -35. Borrow 1 hour = 60 minutes. 60 - 35 = 25.\nSeconds: 14 - 9 = 5\nMilliseconds: 062 - 235 = -173. Borrow 1 second = 1000 milliseconds. 1000 - 173 = 827.\nSeconds: 4 - 1 = 3\nSo, the duration is 2 hours, 25 minutes, 3 seconds, and 827 milliseconds.\nBut we borrowed 1 hour initially. So the duration is 3 hours - 1 hour + 2 hours = 2 hours + 25 minutes + 3 seconds + 827 milliseconds = 2 hours 25 minutes 3.827 seconds. This is incorrect.\n\nLet's calculate the difference again:\n12:01:14.062\n- 09:36:09.235\n= 02:25:04.827\n\n09:36:09.235\n12:01:14.062\n\n12 hours - 9 hours = 3 hours\n1 minute - 36 minutes = -35 minutes. Borrow 1 hour = 60 minutes. 60 - 35 = 25 minutes.\n14 seconds - 9 seconds = 5 seconds.\n062 milliseconds - 235 milliseconds = -173 milliseconds. Borrow 1 second = 1000 milliseconds. 1000 - 173 = 827 milliseconds.\n4 seconds - 1 second = 3 seconds.\nSo the duration is 2 hours, 25 minutes, 3 seconds, 827 milliseconds.\nHowever, we borrowed 1 hour. So the duration is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours. 25 minutes, 3 seconds, 827 milliseconds.\n\n12:01:14.062 - 09:36:09.235 = 2 hours, 25 minutes, 4.827 seconds.\nLet's calculate:\n(12 * 3600 + 1 * 60 + 14) - (9 * 3600 + 36 * 60 + 9) = (43200 + 60 + 14) - (32400 + 2160 + 9) = 43274 - 34569 = 8705\n8705 / 3600 = 2.418\n2 * 3600 = 7200\n8705 - 7200 = 1505\n1505 / 60 = 25.083\n25 * 60 = 1500\n1505 - 1500 = 5.083\nSo the duration is 2 hours, 25 minutes, 5.083 seconds.\n0.083 * 1000 = 83.333 milliseconds.\n\n12:01:14.062 - 09:36:09.235 = 02:25:04.827\nDuration = 2 hours, 25 minutes, 4.827 seconds.\nThe duration is 02:25:04.827\n\n02:25:04.827\n\n<answer>02:25:04.827</answer>",

Borrow 1 hour from the hours, so we have 2 hours.\nMinutes: 60 - 35 = 25\nSeconds: 14 - 9 = 5\nMilliseconds: 062 - 235 = -173.  Borrow 1 second from the seconds.\nSeconds: 4 - 1 = 3\nMilliseconds: 1000 - 173 = 827\nSo we have 02:54:03.827. But we borrowed an hour, so we should add it back.\nThe duration is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.\nSo the duration is 03:54:03.827.\n\nLet's calculate the difference:\n12:01:14.062\n- 09:36:09.235\n= 02:25:04.827\n\nThe start time is 09:36:09.235.\nThe end time is 12:01:14.062.\nThe difference in hours is 12 - 9 = 3.\nThe difference in minutes is 01 - 36 = -35. We need to borrow an hour, which is 60 minutes.\nSo we have 60 - 35 = 25 minutes.\nThe difference in seconds is 14 - 9 = 5.\nThe difference in milliseconds is 062 - 235 = -173. We need to borrow a second, which is 1000 milliseconds.\nSo we have 1000 - 173 = 827 milliseconds.\nWe borrowed 1 second, so we subtract 1 from the seconds.\nSo we have 4 - 1 = 3 seconds.\nSo the duration is 2 hours, 25 minutes, 3 seconds, and 827 milliseconds.\nHowever, we borrowed an hour initially, so the duration is actually 3 hours - 1 hour + 2 hours = 2 hours + 25 minutes + 3 seconds + 827 milliseconds.\nLet's recalculate.\n12:01:14.062 - 09:36:09.235 = 02:25:04.827\nWe need to calculate the duration from 09:36:09.235 to 12:01:14.062.\nHours: 12 - 9 = 3\nMinutes: 1 - 36 = -35. Borrow 1 hour = 60 minutes. 60 - 35 = 25.\nSeconds: 14 - 9 = 5\nMilliseconds: 062 - 235 = -173. Borrow 1 second = 1000 milliseconds. 1000 - 173 = 827.\nSeconds: 4 - 1 = 3\nSo, the duration is 2 hours, 25 minutes, 3 seconds, and 827 milliseconds.\nBut we borrowed 1 hour initially. So the duration is 3 hours - 1 hour + 2 hours = 2 hours + 25 minutes + 3 seconds + 827 milliseconds = 2 hours 25 minutes 3.827 seconds. This is incorrect.\n\nLet's calculate the difference again:\n12:01:14.062\n- 09:36:09.235\n= 02:25:04.827\n\n09:36:09.235\n12:01:14.062\n\n12 hours - 9 hours = 3 hours\n1 minute - 36 minutes = -35 minutes. Borrow 1 hour = 60 minutes. 60 - 35 = 25 minutes.\n14 seconds - 9 seconds = 5 seconds.\n062 milliseconds - 235 milliseconds = -173 milliseconds. Borrow 1 second = 1000 milliseconds. 1000 - 173 = 827 milliseconds.\n4 seconds - 1 second = 3 seconds.\nSo the duration is 2 hours, 25 minutes, 3 seconds, 827 milliseconds.\nHowever, we borrowed 1 hour. So the duration is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours. 25 minutes, 3 seconds, 827 milliseconds.\n\n12:01:14.062 - 09:36:09.235 = 2 hours, 25 minutes, 4.827 seconds.\nLet's calculate:\n(12 * 3600 + 1 * 60 + 14) - (9 * 3600 + 36 * 60 + 9) = (43200 + 60 + 14) - (32400 + 2160 + 9) = 43274 - 34569 = 8705\n8705 / 3600 = 2.418\n2 * 3600 = 7200\n8705 - 7200 = 1505\n1505 / 60 = 25.083\n25 * 60 = 1500\n1505 - 1500 = 5.083\nSo the duration is 2 hours, 25 minutes, 5.083 seconds.\n0.083 * 1000 = 83.333 milliseconds.\n\n12:01:14.062 - 09:36:09.235 = 02:25:04.827\nDuration = 2 hours, 25 minutes, 4.827 seconds.\nThe duration is 02:25:04.827\n\n02:25:04.827\n\n<answer>02:25:04.827</answer>",
