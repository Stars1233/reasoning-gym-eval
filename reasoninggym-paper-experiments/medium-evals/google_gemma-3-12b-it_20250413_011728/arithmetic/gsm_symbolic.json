Therefore, he needs to write 144 pages per week.\n\n5. **Time to write one page:** Mike can write one page every 15 minutes.\n\n6. **Total writing time in minutes:** To write 144 pages, it will take him 144 * 15 = 2160 minutes.\n\n7. **Total writing time in hours:** There are 60 minutes in an hour, so it will take him 2160 / 60 = 36 hours.\n\n<36>",
