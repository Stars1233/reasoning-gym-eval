The edges connect vertices (5, 6), (5, 10), and (7, 10). This means vertices 5, 6, 7, and 10 are connected to each other. The rest of the vertices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9) are isolated.\n\n2. **Color the connected component:** We need to color 5, 6, 7, and 10 such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. We can start by assigning color 1 to vertex 5. Then, vertex 6 must have a different color, so let's assign color 2 to vertex 6. Vertex 7 must have a different color from 5 and 6, so let's assign color 3 to vertex 7. Finally, vertex 10 must have a different color from 5 and 7, so let's assign color 2 to vertex 10. Thus, we have 5:1, 6:2, 7:3, 10:2.\n\n3. **Color the isolated vertices:** Since the remaining vertices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9) are isolated, we can assign them any of the 4 colors.
