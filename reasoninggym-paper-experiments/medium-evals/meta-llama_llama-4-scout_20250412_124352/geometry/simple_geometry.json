The remaining angle \\(= 1620^\\circ - 1174^\\circ = 446^\\circ\\). However, this step actually confirms the calculation but highlights a mistake in assuming convexity with such a large angle.\n\n## 7: Consider convexity constraint\nFor an 11-gon to be convex, each interior angle must be less than \\(180^\\circ\\). An angle of \\(446^\\circ\\) violates this, suggesting a mistake in the problem's premise or my interpretation.
