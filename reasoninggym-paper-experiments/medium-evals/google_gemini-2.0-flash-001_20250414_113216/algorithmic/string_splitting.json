One unit of machine A can be dismanteled into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n2. Two units of machine B can be dismanteled into one unit of part X.\n3.

One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z.\n\nGiven a certain number of initial machines, your job is to continuously cycle through the rules 1-5 above, exausting one rule at a time, until no more rules can be applied, or until a state (counts of each machine and part type) is repeated.\nAfter you make use of a rule, you should update the counts of each machine and part type accordingly, and then restart the process from rule 1.\n\nThe output should be the count of each machine and part type after the rules have been exhaustively applied in the following order: A B C X Y Z.\nFor example 1 0 1 5 4 3 means that you have 1 machine A, 0 machine B, 1 machine C, 5 part X, 4 part Y, and 3 part Z.\n\nNow, you have 54 machine A, 57 machine B, and 99 machine C. Provide the count of each machine and part type after applying the above rules.\nNote: Apply the rules at most 1000 times.

      "question": "There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C.\nHe discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, Z through the following rules:\n1. One unit of machine A can be dismanteled into two units of part X and one unit of part Y.\n2. Two units of machine B can be dismanteled into one unit of part X.\n3. Two units of machine C can be dismanteled into one unit of part Y.\n4. One unit of machine B and one unit of machine C can be combined into one unit of machine A.\n5. One unit of part X and one unit of part Y can be combined into one unit of part Z.\n\nGiven a certain number of initial machines, your job is to continuously cycle through the rules 1-5 above, exausting one rule at a time, until no more rules can be applied, or until a state (counts of each machine and part type) is repeated.\nAfter you make use of a rule, you should update the counts of each machine and part type accordingly, and then restart the process from rule 1.\n\nThe output should be the count of each machine and part type after the rules have been exhaustively applied in the following order: A B C X Y Z.\nFor example 1 0 1 5 4 3 means that you have 1 machine A, 0 machine B, 1 machine C, 5 part X, 4 part Y, and 3 part Z.\n\nNow, you have 84 machine A, 61 machine B, and 57 machine C. Provide the count of each machine and part type after applying the above rules.\nNote: Apply the rules at most 1000 times. If the rules cannot be applied anymore, or if you have reached the maximum number of iterations, stop and provide the current counts of each machine and part type.\n",
