This is just an approximation.\n\nLet's count the number of weeks. 117 days is 16 weeks and 5 days (117 = 16 * 7 + 5).\nSo we have 16 full weeks, each contributing 5 weekdays, which gives 16 * 5 = 80 weekdays.\nNow we need to account for the remaining 5 days. These days are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. The weekdays are Thursday, Friday, Monday. So we have 3 weekdays.\nTotal weekdays are 80 + 3 = 83.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the number of days of each type of day.\nThe days are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\nTotal days = 117.\nNumber of weeks = 16 full weeks + 5 days.\nSo we have 16 Thursdays, 16 Fridays, 16 Saturdays, 16 Sundays, 16 Mondays, 16 Tuesdays, 16 Wednesdays.\nThe remaining 5 days are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.\nSo we have 16+1 = 17 Thursdays.\n16+1 = 17 Fridays.\n16+1 = 17 Saturdays.\n16+1 = 17 Sundays.\n16+1 = 17 Mondays.\n16 Tuesdays.\n16 Wednesdays.\n\nNumber of weekdays = Number of Mondays + Number of Tuesdays + Number of Wednesdays + Number of Thursdays + Number of Fridays\n= 17 + 16 + 16 + 17 + 17 = 83.\n\n</answer>83</answer>",

The remaining 3 days are Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, so there is 1 weekday. Total weekdays in October = 20 + 1 = 21.\n\nNovember: From Tuesday, November 1 to Tuesday, November 15, there are 15 days. The days are Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue. The weekdays are Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue.
