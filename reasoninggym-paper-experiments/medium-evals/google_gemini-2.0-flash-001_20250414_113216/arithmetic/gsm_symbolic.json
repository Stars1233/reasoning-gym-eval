This is contradictory. Let's assume he works for 2 weeks every month, so 14 days per month.\nHe works for 14 days every month. In a year, he works for 14 days/month * 12 months/year = 168 days.\nHe gets paid $135 every day, so he earns 168 days * $135/day = $22680.\n\nIf we assume he works 6 days every week, then in a year (52 weeks), he works 6 days/week * 52 weeks/year = 312 days.\nHe earns 312 days * $135/day = $42120.\n\nLet's assume the landscaper works 2 weeks a month *and* 6 days a week.

He also works 6 days a week. So the number of days he works each month is at least 14.\nIf he works 6 days a week, then in 2 weeks he would work 12 days.
