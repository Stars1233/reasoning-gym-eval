This means that the first number in the third row must be 1. The third column already has a 1, so we can't put a 1 there. The fourth number in the third row is a 2. This means the third row must be 1 4 3 2.\n\n```\n2 1 4 3\n4 3 2 1\n1 4 3 2\n3 _ 1 _\n```\n\nFinally, let's look at the fourth row. We need 2 and 4. The second column already has a 1, 3, and 4, so the only remaining number is 2. The last column has a 1, 2, and 3, so the only remaining number is 4. The fourth row must be 3 2 1 4.\n\n```\n2 1 4 3\n4 3 2 1\n1 4 3 2\n3 2 1 4\n```\n<answer>\n2 1 4 3\n4 3 2 1\n1 4 3 2\n3 2 1 4\n</answer>",

In the top-left 2x2 subgrid, the top right cell can be either 1 or 2. If we put 2 there, then the first row would have two 2s which is not possible. Therefore, the top right cell must be 3. Then the first row becomes \\_ 3 \\_ 1.\n*   Since the first row is \\_ 3 \\_ 1, the missing numbers are 2 and 4. The first column has 4, so the first number in the first row must be 2.

The missing numbers would be 3 and 4. If the last number in the third row is 4, then the last number in the fourth row must be 3. However, the third column would be 4 3 1 3 which is not possible. So, the first number in the third row must be 2. Therefore, the third row is 2 4 1 3.\n*   Now the fourth row is \\_ 3 \\_ \\_. The missing numbers are 1, 2, and 4.

The missing numbers are 1 and 4.\n6.  **Analyze the second column:** The second column has `_ _ _ _`. All numbers are missing.\n7.  **Analyze the third column:** The third column has `_ _ _ 4`. The missing numbers are 1, 2, and 3.\n8.  **Analyze the fourth column:** The fourth column has `3 4 1 2`.

The missing numbers are 1 and 2.\n11. **Analyze the bottom-left 2x2 subgrid:** The subgrid has `_ _ 3 _`. The missing numbers are 1, 2, and 4.\n12. **Analyze the bottom-right 2x2 subgrid:** The subgrid has `_ 1 4 2`. The missing number is 3.\n\nLet's start filling in the grid:\n\n*   From the first column, we know that the top cell can be either 1 or 4, and the third cell can be either 1 or 4.\n*   From the fourth row, the second cell must be 1.\n*   Therefore, the puzzle is now:\n\n_ _ _ 3\n2 _ _ 4\n_ _ _ 1\n3 1 4 2\n\n*   In the first row, we have `_ _ _ 3`. Since the second column now has 1, the first row cannot have 1 in its second cell.\n*   In the second row, we have `2 _ _ 4`. The missing numbers are 1 and 3.\n*   In the third row, we have `_ _ _ 1`. The missing numbers are 2, 3, and 4.\n*   In the first column, we have `_ 2 _ 3`. The missing numbers are 1 and 4.\n\n*   Looking at the top-left 2x2 subgrid, we have:\n    `_ _`\n    `2 _`\n    The missing numbers are 1, 3, and 4.\n*   Looking at the top row, the missing numbers are 1, 2, and 4. Since the top-left cell is in the first column, and the third row has 4 in the first column, the first cell of the first row must be 1 or 4.\n\nLet's try filling the first row with 1 2 4 3. The puzzle is now:\n1 2 4 3\n2 _ _ 4\n_ _ _ 1\n3 1 4 2\n\n*   The second row has missing numbers 3 and 1. Since the first column has 1, the second row must have 3 in the second column and 1 in the third column.\n*   Now the puzzle is:\n\n1 2 4 3\n2 3 1 4\n_ _ _ 1\n3 1 4 2\n\n*   Now the third row has missing numbers 2, 3, and 4. Since the third column has 4, the third row cannot have 4 in the third column.\n*   The first column has missing numbers 4. The third row must have 4 in the first column.\n*   Now the puzzle is:\n\n1 2 4 3\n2 3 1 4\n4 _ _ 1\n3 1 4 2\n\n*   The third row now has 2 and 3 missing. The second column has 3, so the third row must have 2 in the second column and 3 in the third column.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n1 2 4 3\n2 3 1 4\n4 2 3 1\n3 1 4 2\n</answer>",

We need to fill in the numbers 1 and 4.\n7.  **Analyze the third column:** We have _ 3 4 2. We need to fill in the numbers 1.\n8.  **Analyze the fourth column:** We have _ 4 1 _. We need to fill in the numbers 2 and 3.\n9.  **Consider the top-left 2x2 subgrid:** We need to fill in 1, 2, 3, and 4. We already have 1 and 2.\n10. **Consider the top-right 2x2 subgrid:** We need to fill in 1, 2, 3, and 4. We already have 3 and 4.\n11. **Consider the bottom-left 2x2 subgrid:** We need to fill in 1, 2, 3, and 4. We already have 2 and 3.\n12. **Consider the bottom-right 2x2 subgrid:** We need to fill in 1, 2, 3, and 4. We already have 1 and 2.\n\nLet's fill in the first row. Since the second column has 2, the first cell cannot be 2. Since the third column has 3, the first cell cannot be 3. So it must be 4. The first row becomes 4 _ _ _.\nNow the first column has 4 1 2 _. The missing number is 3. So we fill in 3 to the fourth row, first column.\nThe fourth row is now 3 _ 2 _.\nSince the first row has 4, 1, 2, 3, the missing number is 1. The first row becomes 4 1 _ _.\nSince the fourth column has 4, the last cell of the first row is not 4.\nSince the second row has 4, the second cell of the first row is not 4.\nSince the third row has 4, the third cell of the first row is not 4.\nSo the first row becomes 4 1 _ _.\n\nThe first row must be 4 1 _ _. Since the third column has 3 and 4, the first row must be 4 1 2 3.\n\nThe puzzle is now:\n4 1 2 3\n1 2 3 4\n2 3 4 1\n3 _ 2 _\n\nThe fourth row must be 3 4 2 1.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n4 1 2 3\n1 2 3 4\n2 3 4 1\n3 4 1 2\n</answer>",
