We need to place five queens in total, so we need to place two more queens.\n\n* **Strategy:** Iterate through the board and try placing queens in empty cells. After placing a queen, check if it conflicts with any existing queens. If it does, remove the queen and try a different cell.\n\n* **Step-by-step Placement:**\n\n1.  **Current board:**\n```\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ Q _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ Q _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ Q _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\n\n2.  **Find a safe spot for the next queen:** Start from the top-left corner and move row by row.\n    *   (0,0): Placing a queen at (0,0) is safe.\n    *   Update the board:\n```\nQ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ Q _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ Q _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ Q _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\n\n3.  **Find a safe spot for the final queen:**\n    *   (0,0) is occupied.\n    *   (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7) are not safe.\n    *   (1,0), (1,1) are occupied or not safe.\n    *   (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) are not safe.\n    *   (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) are not safe.\n    *   (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) are not safe.\n    *   (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7) are not safe.\n    *   (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7) are not safe.\n    *   (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) are not safe.\n    *   (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) are not safe.\n\nIt seems impossible to place two more queens without them attacking each other. Reconsider placing the first queen.\n\n1.  **Alternative placement:**\n```\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ Q _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ Q _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ Q _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\nTry placing at (0,3).\n```\n_ _ _ Q _ _ _ _\n_ Q _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ Q _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ Q _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\nTry placing at (4,7).\n```\n_ _ _ Q _ _ _ _\n_ Q _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ Q _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ Q\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ Q _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\n\n<answer>_ _ _ Q _ _ _ _\n_ Q _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ Q _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ Q\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ Q _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</answer>",
