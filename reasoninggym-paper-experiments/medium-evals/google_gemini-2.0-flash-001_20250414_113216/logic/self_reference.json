Two other statements must be true. Since 3, 4, 5 are false, statements 7 must be true. This leaves one more statement to be true.\nStatement 7 being true means F=2 is composite, which it is not. So, T=5, F=2 is not a solution.\n\nCase 2: $T=6, F=1$\nStatement 1 is true.\nStatement 2 is true.\nStatement 3 is false.\nStatement 4 is true.\nStatement 5 is true.\nStatement 6 is false (6 is not prime).\nStatement 7 is false (1 is not composite).\nNumber of true statements is 6.\nThe statements 1, 2, 4, 5 are true. Two other statements must be true. Since 3, 6, 7 are false, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 3: $T=7, F=0$\nStatement 1 is true.\nStatement 2 is true.\nStatement 3 is false.\nStatement 4 is false.\nStatement 5 is false.\nStatement 6 is true (7 is prime).\nStatement 7 is false (0 is not composite).\nNumber of true statements is 7.\nStatements 1, 2, 6 are true. Four other statements must be true. Since 3, 4, 5, 7 are false, this case is not possible.\n\nLet's consider Statement 3 and 4. If Statement 3 is true, then $T=3$. If Statement 4 is true, then $T=6$. Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\nIf $T=3$, then Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true. $F=4$.\nIf $T=6$, then Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true. $F=1$.\n\nIf $T=3$, then Statement 6 is false since 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true if $F=4$ is composite, which is true.\nIf $T=6$, then Statement 6 is false since 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is false if $F=1$ is composite, which is false.\n\nConsider the case where $T=3$ and $F=4$.\nStatements 3 and 5 are true. Since $T=3$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 6 is true since 3 is prime, Statement 7 is true since 4 is composite. Statement 4 is false.\nSo we have: F, F, T, F, T, T, T. This gives $T=4$, which is not 3. So this case is impossible.\n\nConsider the case where $T=6$ and $F=1$.\nStatements 4 and 5 are true. Since $T=6$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is false since 6 is not prime, Statement 7 is false since 1 is not composite. Statement 3 is false.\nSo we have: T, T, F, T, T, F, F. This gives $T=4$, which is not 6. So this case is impossible.\n\nTherefore, there are no solutions.\n\n</answer>0</answer>",

Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is false. We have $T=3$, a contradiction.\n\nIf $T=6$, then $F=1$.

Statement 7 is false. We have $T=3$, a contradiction.\n\nNow, let's re-examine the statements. We know that $T \\ge 4$ and $T \\ne 4$.\nIf $T=5$, then $F=2$. The true statements are 1, 2, 6.
