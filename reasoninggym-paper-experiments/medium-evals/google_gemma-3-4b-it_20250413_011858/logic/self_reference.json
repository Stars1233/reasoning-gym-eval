Since $T+F = 7$, we have $T = 7-F \\ge 7-2 = 5$.\nFrom Statement 3, we have $T = 4$.\nFrom Statement 4, we have $F = 5$.\nFrom Statement 5, we have either $T=4$ or $F=5$, but not both.\nFrom Statement 6, we have $T$ is a prime number.\nFrom Statement 7, we have $F$ is a composite number.\n\nLet's analyze the statements.\nStatement 1: $T \\ge 7$.\nStatement 2: $F \\le 2$.\nStatement 3: $T = 4$.\nStatement 4: $F = 5$.\nStatement 5: $T=4$ or $F=5$, but not both.\nStatement 6: $T$ is prime.\nStatement 7: $F$ is composite.\n\nSince $T+F = 7$, we have $T = 7-F$.\nIf $T=4$, then $F = 7-4 = 3$. But $F \\le 2$, so $T \\ne 4$.\nIf $F=5$, then $T = 7-5 = 2$. But $T \\ge 7$, so $F \\ne 5$.\n\nNow, let's consider the conditions given by the statements.\nFrom Statement 1, $T \\ge 7$.\nFrom Statement 2, $F \\le 2$.\nFrom Statement 5, $T=4$ or $F=5$, but not both.\nSince $T+F=7$, we can analyze the possible values of $T$ and $F$.\nIf $T=7$, then $F=0$.\n$T$ is prime: $7$ is prime.\n$F$ is composite: $0$ is not composite.\nSo $T=7$ is not a solution.\nIf $T=6$, then $F=1$.\n$T$ is prime: $6$ is not prime.\nSo $T=6$ is not a solution.\nIf $T=5$, then $F=2$.\n$T$ is prime: $5$ is prime.\n$F$ is composite: $2$ is composite.\nThis satisfies all the conditions.\nIf $T=4$, then $F=3$.\nFrom Statement 5, we must have $F=5$, so $T=2$.\n$T$ is prime: $2$ is prime.\n$F$ is composite: $3$ is composite.\nBut $T \\ge 7$, so this is not a solution.\n\nWe have $T=5$ and $F=2$.\n$T \\ge 7$ is false.\n$F \\le 2$ is true.\n$T=4$ is false.\n$F=5$ is false.\n$T=4$ or $F=5$ is false.\n$T$ is prime: $5$ is prime.\n$F$ is composite: $2$ is composite.\n\nLet's reconsider the statements.\nStatement 1: At least 7 of these 7 statements are true. This means all 7 are true.\nStatement 2: At most 2 of these 7 statements are false. This means $F \\le 2$.\nStatement 3: Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true. This means $T=4$.\nStatement 4: Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false. This means $F=5$.\nStatement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means $T=4$ or $F=5$, but not both.\nStatement 6: The number of true statements is a prime number.\nStatement 7: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nSince $T+F=7$, we have $T=7-F$.\nIf $T=4$, then $F=3$. Statement 5 says $T=4$ or $F=5$, but not both. Since $F=3$, we have $T=4$ and $F \\ne 5$, so this is consistent.\n$T=4$ is not prime, so this case is not possible.\nIf $F=5$, then $T=2$. Statement 5 says $T=4$ or $F=5$, but not both. Since $T=2$, we have $T \\ne 4$ and $F=5$.\n$T=2$ is prime. $F=5$ is composite.\nSo $T=2$ and $F=5$ is a possible solution.\nHowever, Statement 1 says $T \\ge 7$, which is false.\n\nLet's consider the case where $T=7$ and $F=0$.\nStatement 1: $T \\ge 7$, so $7 \\ge 7$ (True)\nStatement 2: $F \\le 2$, so $0 \\le 2$ (True)\nStatement 3: $T=4$, which is false.\nStatement 4: $F=5$, which is false.\nStatement 5: $T=4$ or $F=5$, but not both. Since $T=7$ and $F=0$, this is false.\nStatement 6: $T=7$ is prime. (True)\nStatement 7: $F=0$ is not composite. (False)\n\nThe only possible solution is $T=2$ and $F=5$.\nBut we need to consider the statements together.\n\nSince $T+F = 7$, we have $T = 7-F$.\nFrom Statement 5, either $T=4$ or $F=5$, but not both.\nIf $T=4$, then $F = 7-4 = 3$. Since $F \\le 2$, this case is impossible.\nIf $F=5$, then $T = 7-5 = 2$.\nStatement 1: $T \\ge 7$. $2 \\ge 7$ is false.\nTherefore, there are no solutions.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 0.",
