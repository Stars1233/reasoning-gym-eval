The grid consists of walls ('/') and passages (' '). We need to find the shortest path from 'g' to '*'.\n\nWe can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.\n\n1.  Start at 'g' and mark it as visited.\n2.  Explore the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) of 'g'.\n3.  If a neighbor is a passage and hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the goal '*' is reached.\n5.  The number of steps is the distance from 'g' to '*'.\n\nLet's trace the path:\n\nStarting at 'g', we can move right, down, right, down, right, down, right, down, right, down, right, down, right, down,

Mark visited cells to avoid cycles.\n4.  If we reach 'n', the number of steps is the distance from 'G' to 'n'.\n\nLet's trace the path:\n- Start at G (0, 13).\n- Possible moves: up, down, left, right.\n- We can visualize the grid and explore possible paths.\n\nThe shortest path is:\nG -> (1, 13) -> (2, 13) -> (3, 13) -> (4, 13) -> (5, 13) -> (6, 13) -> (7, 13) -> (8, 13) -> (9, 13) -> (10, 13) -> (11, 13) -> (12, 13) -> (13, 13) -> (14,

We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.\n\n1.  Start at 'G'.\n2.  Explore adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are passages ('o').\n3.  Mark visited cells to avoid cycles.\n4.  If we reach 'n', the number of steps is the distance from 'G' to 'n'.\n\nLet's trace the path:\n- Start at G (0, 13).\n- Possible moves: up, down, left, right.\n- We can visualize the grid and explore possible paths.\n\nThe shortest path is:\nG -> (1, 13) -> (2, 13) -> (3, 13) -> (4, 13) -> (5, 13) -> (6, 13) -> (7, 13) -> (8, 13) -> (9, 13) -> (10, 13) -> (11, 13) -> (12, 13) -> (13, 13) -> (14,
