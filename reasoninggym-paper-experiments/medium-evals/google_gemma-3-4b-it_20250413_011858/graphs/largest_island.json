An island is a group of 1's connected horizontally or vertically.\n\nWe can iterate through the grid and use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to find the islands.\n\nHere's a DFS approach:\n1.  Initialize a `visited` matrix to keep track of visited cells.\n2.  Iterate through the grid.\n3.  If a cell is 1 and not visited, perform DFS starting from that cell.\n4.  DFS:\n    *   Mark the current cell as visited.\n    *   Increment the island area.\n    *   Recursively call DFS on the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if they are within the grid boundaries and are 1 and not visited.\n\nAfter iterating through the entire grid, the maximum island area will be the largest island area found during the DFS traversal.\n\n```python\ndef max_island_area(grid):\n    if not grid:\n        return 0\n\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    max_area = 0\n\n    def dfs(row, col):\n        if row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or grid[row][col] == 0 or visited[row][col]:\n            return 0\n\n        visited[row][col] = True\n        area = 1\n\n        area += dfs(row + 1, col)\n        area += dfs(row - 1, col)\n        area += dfs(row, col + 1)\n        area += dfs(row, col - 1)\n\n        return area\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:\n                area = dfs(i, j)\n                max_area = max(max_area, area)\n\n    return max_area\n```",
