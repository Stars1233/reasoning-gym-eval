      "question": "There are nine different blocks [A] [B] [C] {A} {B} {C} (A) (B) (C)\n1. One [A], one [B], and one [C] can be combined to form one {A}.\n2. One [A] and one [B] can be combined to form one {C}.\n3. One [B] and one [C] can be combined to form one {B}.\n4. Two [C] can be combined to form one {C}.\n5. One {A} and one {C} can be combined to form one (A) and one (B).\n6. Two {B} can be combined to form one (C).\n\nGiven a certain number of initial blocks, your job is to cycle through the rules 1-6 above, synthesizing new blocks until no more rules can be applied, or until a state (counts of each block type) is repeated.\nIn the case a state is repeated the answer is the state before the repetition!\n\nThe output should be the count of each block type after the rules have been applied in the order they are listed above.\nFor example 1 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 1 means that you have 1 [A] 0 [B] 3 [C] 0 {A} 2 {B} 0 {C} 0 (A) 0 (B) 1 (C).\n\nNow, you have 84 [A], 61 [B], and 57 [C] blocks. Provide the count of each block type after applying the above rules.\nNote: Apply the rules at most 1000 times. If the rules cannot be applied anymore, or if you have reached the maximum number of iterations, stop and provide the current counts.\n",
