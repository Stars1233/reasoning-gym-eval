Since 3239 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is 3 + 2 + 3 + 9 = 17, which is not divisible by 3, so 3239 is not divisible by 3.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 5. Since 3239 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 7. 3239 = 7 \u00d7 462 + 5, so it is not divisible by 7.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 11. 3239 = 11 \u00d7 294 + 5, so it is not divisible by 11.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 13. 3239 = 13 \u00d7 249 + 2, so it is not divisible by 13.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 17. 3239 = 17 \u00d7 190 + 9, so it is not divisible by 17.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 19. 3239 = 19 \u00d7 170 + 9, so it is not divisible by 19.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 23. 3239 = 23 \u00d7 140 + 19, so it is not divisible by 23.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 29. 3239 = 29 \u00d7 111 + 20, so it is not divisible by 29.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 31. 3239 = 31 \u00d7 104 + 15, so it is not divisible by 31.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 37. 3239 = 37 \u00d7 87 + 20, so it is not divisible by 37.\nNext, we check if 3239 is divisible by 41. 3239 = 41 \u00d7 79 + 0. So 3239 = 41 \u00d7 79.\nSince 41 and 79 are both prime numbers, the prime factorization of 3239 is 41 \u00d7 79.\n\n<41 \u00d7 79>",
