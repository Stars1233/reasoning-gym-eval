We are given $A = 41$.\nMichael saw the comet a second time when he was $2A$ years old.\nLet $t$ be the number of years between when Michael's father saw the comet and when Michael saw it the second time.\nThen $t = 2A - A = A$.\nThe comet orbits every 65 years.\nSo, the number of orbits the comet made in $t$ years is $\\frac{t}{65}$.\nSince the comet was visible when Michael's father was 41, and Michael saw it again when he was $2A$, the number of orbits is the same.\nThus, $\\frac{t}{65} = 1$.\nSo $t = 65$.\nMichael's age when he saw the comet the second time is $A + t = 41 + 65 = 106$.\nBut we are given that Michael saw the comet the second time when he was $2A = 2 \\times 41 = 82$.\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nLet $x$ be the age Michael was when he saw the comet for the first time.\nMichael's father saw the comet when he was 41.\nThe comet orbits every 65 years.\nSo, the comet was visible when Michael's father was $41 - 65n$ for some integer $n$.\nSince Michael's father saw the comet when he was 41, we have $41 - 65n = 41$, so $65n = 0$, which means $n = 0$.\nMichael saw the comet a second time when he was $2$ times the age his father was when he saw the comet.\nSo, Michael saw the comet the second time when he was $2 \\times 41 = 82$.\nThe time between the two sightings is $82 - x$.\nThe number of orbits in this time is $\\frac{82 - x}{65}$.\nSince the comet was visible when Michael's father was 41, it was also visible when Michael was $x$.\nSo, $\\frac{82 - x}{65} = 1$.\n$82 - x = 65$.\n$x = 82 - 65 = 17$.\nMichael was 17 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.\n\nLet $x$ be the age Michael was when he saw the comet for the first time.\nMichael's father saw the comet when he was 41.\nThe comet orbits every 65 years.\nSo, the comet was visible when Michael's father was $41 - 65n$ for some integer $n$.\nSince Michael's father saw the comet when he was 41, we have $41 - 65n = 41$, so $65n = 0$, which means $n = 0$.\nMichael saw the comet a second time when he was $2$ times the age his father was when he saw the comet.\nSo, Michael saw the comet the second time when he was $2 \\times 41 = 82$.\nThe time between the two sightings is $82 - x$.\nThe number of orbits in this time is $\\frac{82 - x}{65}$.\nSince the comet was visible when Michael's father was 41, it was also visible when Michael was $x$.\nSo, $\\frac{82 - x}{65} = 1$.\n$82 - x = 65$.\n$x = 82 - 65 = 17$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 17.\n",

This is incorrect.\nLet's reconsider the problem.\nOn Monday, he sold 14 more boxes of brownie than on Tuesday. $B_M = B_T + 14$\nOn Monday, he sold 26 boxes of cherry pie. $C_M = 26$\nOn Tuesday, he sold 28 boxes of brownie. $B_T = 28$\nOn Tuesday, he sold $C_T = C_M - 15 = 26 - 15 = 11$ boxes of cherry pie.\nTotal brownie sold = $B_M + B_T = 42 + 28 = 70$\nTotal cherry pie sold = $C_M + C_T = 26 + 11 = 37$\nTotal earned = $70 \\times 13 + 37 \\times 24 = 910 + 888 = 1798$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1798\n",

      "best_full_model_response": "Let's calculate the number of days the landscaper works in a month.\nHe works for 2 weeks every month. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, he works for $2 \\times 4 = 8$ days per month.\nHowever, we need to consider the exact number of days in a month. Let's assume an average month has 30 days.\nSo, he works for 2 weeks, which is $2 \\times 7 = 14$ days.\nAlternatively, he works for 2 weeks every month, which is $2 \\times 14 = 28$ days.\nBut we are given that he works for 2 weeks every month, so he works for $2 \\times 7 = 14$ days per month.\nHe also works for 6 days every week. So, in a month, he works for $6 \\times 4 = 24$ days.\nSince he works for 2 weeks every month, he works for $2 \\times 7 = 14$ days.\nAlso, he works for 6 days every week. So, in a month, he works for $6 \\times 4 = 24$ days.\nLet's consider the given information: he works for 2 weeks every month and for 6 days every week.\nIn a month, he works for 2 weeks, which is $2 \\times 7 = 14$ days.\nHe also works for 6 days every week. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, he works for $6 \\times 4 = 24$ days.\nHowever, the problem states that he works for 2 weeks every month. So, we calculate the number of days he works in a month as $2 \\times 7 = 14$ days.\nHe gets paid $135 every day. So, in a month, he earns $14 \\times 135$.\n$14 \\times 135 = 14 \\times (100 + 35) = 1400 + 14 \\times 35 = 1400 + 14 \\times (30 + 5) = 1400 + 420 + 70 = 1400 + 490 = 1890$.\nSo, he earns $1890 in a month.\nThere are 12 months in a year.\nSo, he earns $12 \\times 1890$.\n$12 \\times 1890 = 12 \\times (1900 - 10) = 12 \\times 1900 - 120 = 22800 - 120 = 22680$.\n\nNow let's consider the other information: he works for 6 days every week.\nIn a month, there are approximately 4 weeks. So, he works for $6 \\times 4 = 24$ days.\nHe works for 2 weeks every month, so he works for $2 \\times 7 = 14$ days.\nThe problem states he works for 2 weeks every month and 6 days every week.\nSo, in a month, he works $2 \\times 7 = 14$ days and $4 \\times 6 = 24$ days.\nThe total number of days he works in a month is $14 + 24 = 38$ days.\nWe need to find the number of days in a year. A year has 365 days.\nSo, the number of days he works in a year is $\\frac{365}{7} \\approx 52.14$.\nHe works for 2 weeks every month, so he works $2 \\times 4 = 8$ months.\nIn 8 months, he works $8 \\times 14 = 112$ days.\nHe works for 6 days every week, so in a year he works $6 \\times 52 = 312$ days.\nLet's calculate the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year.\nHe works for 6 days every week, so he works $52 \\times 6 = 312$ days.\nHe gets paid $135 every day. So, he earns $312 \\times 135$.\n$312 \\times 135 = 312 \\times (100 + 35) = 31200 + 312 \\times 35 = 31200 + 312 \\times (30 + 5) = 31200 + 9360 + 1560 = 31200 + 10920 = 42120$.\n\nHe works for 2 weeks every month, which is 14 days.\nHe works for 6 days every week, so in a month he works $6 \\times 4 = 24$ days.\nTotal days per month = 14 + 24 = 38 days.\nNumber of months in a year = 12.\nTotal days in a year = $38 \\times 12 = 456$ days.\nHe earns $135 per day, so he earns $456 \\times 135 = 456 \\times (100 + 35) = 45600 + 456 \\times 35 = 45600 + 456 \\times (30 + 5) = 45600 + 13680 + 2280 = 45600 + 15960 = 61560$.\n\nHe works 2 weeks every month which is 14 days.\nHe works 6 days every week. In a month there are approximately 4 weeks.\nSo he works $14 + 4 \\times 6 = 14 + 24 = 38$ days per month.\nIn a year there are 12 months.\nSo he works $12 \\times 38 = 456$ days.\nHe earns $135 per day.\nSo he earns $456 \\times 135 = 61560$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 61560\n22680\n42120\n61560\nLet's recalculate the number of days in a month.\nHe works for 2 weeks every month, so he works for $2 \\times 7 = 14$ days.\nHe works for 6 days every week, so in a month he works $6 \\times 4 = 24$ days.\nSo he works $14+24 = 38$ days per month.\nIn a year, there are 12 months, so he works $12 \\times 38 = 456$ days.\nHe earns $135 per day, so he earns $456 \\times 135 = 456 \\times (100 + 35) = 45600 + 456 \\times 35 = 45600 + 456 \\times (30 + 5) = 45600 + 456 \\times 30 + 456 \\times 5 = 45600 + 13680 + 2280 = 45600 + 15960 = 61560$.\n\nFinal Answer: 61560\n",
