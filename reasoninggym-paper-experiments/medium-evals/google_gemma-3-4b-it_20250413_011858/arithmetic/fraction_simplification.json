This is incorrect. Let's try another approach.\n\n26010/39600 = (26010 \u00f7 10) / (39600 \u00f7 10) = 2601 / 3960 = (2601 \u00f7 9) / (3960 \u00f7 9) = 289 / 440 = (289 \u00f7 17) / (440 \u00f7 17) = 17 / 26.0588... This is incorrect.\n\nLet's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 26010 and 39600.\n26010 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 867 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 3 * 289 = 2 * 3^2 * 5 * 17^2\n39600 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 11\nGCD(26010, 39600) = 2 * 3^2 * 5 = 2 * 9 * 5 = 90\n26010 / 90 = 289\n39600 / 90 = 440\nSo, 26010/39600 = 289/440.\n\n289 = 17^2\n440 = 2^3 * 5 * 11\nSince they have no common factors, the fraction is already in its lowest terms.\n\n289/440</answer>",
