Since we have a negative value, we borrow an hour from the hours.\nHours: 3 - 1 = 2 hours\nMinutes: 60 - 35 = 25 minutes\nSeconds: 14 - 09 = 5 seconds\nMilliseconds: 062 - 235 = -173 milliseconds. Since we have a negative value, we borrow a second from the seconds.\nSeconds: 5 - 1 = 4 seconds\nMilliseconds: 1000 - 173 = 827 milliseconds\n\nTotal time in minutes: 3 hours + 25 minutes + 4 seconds + 827 milliseconds = (3 * 60) + 25 + 4 + 827 = 180 + 25 + 4 + 827 = 180 + 29 + 827 = 209 + 827 = 1036 minutes.\n\nNow, convert the total time in minutes to hours, minutes, and seconds.\n1036 minutes = 17 hours and 16 minutes (since 1036 = 17 * 60 + 16)\n1036 minutes = 17 hours + (36 - 12 * 17) minutes = 17 hours + (36 - 204) minutes = 17 hours - 168 minutes = 17 hours - 2 hours and 48 minutes = 15 hours and 12 minutes\nAlternatively:\n1036 minutes = 17 hours and 16 minutes.\n\nThe call lasted 1036 minutes.  Convert to hours, minutes, seconds.\n1036 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 17 hours and 16 minutes.\n17 hours and 16 minutes = 17:16\nSo, the call lasted 17:16:00.000.\n\nLet's recalculate:\nFrom 09:36:09.235 to 12:01:14.062\nHours: 12 - 9 = 3 hours\nMinutes: 01 - 36 = -35 minutes.  Borrow 1 hour. 60 - 36 = 24 minutes.  So 3 - 1 = 2 hours and 24 minutes.\nSeconds: 14 - 09 = 5 seconds.\nMilliseconds: 062 - 235 = -173. Borrow 1 second. 1000 - 173 = 827 milliseconds.\nTotal time = 2 hours 24 minutes 5 seconds 827 milliseconds.\n2 hours 24 minutes 5 seconds 827 milliseconds = 2:24:05.827\n\nThe duration of the call is 12:01:14.062 - 09:36:09.235\nHours: 12 - 9 = 3 hours\nMinutes: 01 - 36 = -35 minutes. Borrow 1 hour. 60 - 36 = 24 minutes. So 01 + 24 = 25 minutes.\nSeconds: 14 - 09 = 5 seconds.\nMilliseconds: 062 - 235 = -173. Borrow 1 second. 1000 - 173 = 827 milliseconds.\nTotal time = 3 hours 25 minutes 5 seconds 827 milliseconds.\n\n<03:25:05.827>",
