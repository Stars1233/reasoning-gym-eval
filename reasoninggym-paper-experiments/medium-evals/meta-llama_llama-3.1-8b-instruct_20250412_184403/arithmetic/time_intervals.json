Since the year is 2282, which is a leap year, there are 29 days in February.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of days:\n2 days (in January) + 29 days (in February) = 31 days\n\nHowever, the meeting did not end on the last day of February, but on the 9th. So, we need to subtract the number of days from the 9th to the end of February:\n29 - 9 = 20 days\n\nTherefore, the meeting lasted for 31 + 20 = 51 days.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.

We can use the UTC timezone as a reference.\n\nThe first date and time is 2241-10-17 14:19 -0700. To convert it to UTC, we need to add 7 hours to the local time.\n\nUTC time = 2241-10-17 21:19\n\nThe second date and time is 2241-11-07 17:34 +0400. To convert it to UTC, we need to subtract 4 hours from the local time.\n\nUTC time = 2241-11-07 13:34\n\nNow, we can calculate the time difference between the two UTC times.\n\nTime difference = 2241-11-07 13:34 - 2241-10-17 21:19\n\nThis is approximately 21 days, 16 hours, and 15 minutes.\n\nTo express the answer in the required format, we need to convert the time difference to days and hours.\n\nDays = 21\nHours = 16\nMinutes = 15\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nanswer here\n21 days, 16:15",
