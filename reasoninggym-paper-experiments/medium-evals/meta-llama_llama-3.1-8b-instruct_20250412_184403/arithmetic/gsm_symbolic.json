So, the total number of plates Olivia had before using 8 plates is x + 14.\n\nAfter using 8 plates, Olivia had (x + 14) - 8 = x + 6 plates.\n\nWe also know that later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 36 plates. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 6 = 36\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\nx = 30\n\nTherefore, the number of plates in the package that Olivia bought is 30.",
