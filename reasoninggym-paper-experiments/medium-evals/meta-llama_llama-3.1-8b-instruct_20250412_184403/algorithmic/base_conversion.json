Convert the decimal number to base-18.\n\nFirst, let's convert the base-17 number d499 to decimal:\n\nd (base-17) = 13 (in decimal)\n4 (base-17) = 4 (in decimal)\n9 (base-17) = 9 (in decimal)\n9 (base-17) = 9 (in decimal)\n\nNow, we multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 17 and add them together:\n\n13 \u00d7 17^3 = 13 \u00d7 4913 = 63909\n4 \u00d7 17^2 = 4 \u00d7 289 = 1156\n9 \u00d7 17^1 = 9 \u00d7 17 = 153\n9 \u00d7 17^0 = 9 \u00d7 1 = 9\n\nNow, we add the results together:\n63909 + 1156 + 153 + 9 = 65127\n\nNow, we have the decimal equivalent of the base-17 number d499, which is 65127.\n\nNext, we need to convert 65127 to base-18. To do this, we divide 65127 by 18 and take the remainder. We repeat this process until the quotient is 0.\n\n65127 \u00f7 18 = 3621 remainder 9\n3621 \u00f7 18 = 201 remainder 3\n201 \u00f7 18 = 11 remainder 9\n11 \u00f7 18 = 0 remainder 11\n\nNow, we write the remainders in reverse order to get the base-18 number:\n99139\n\nSo, the base-17 number d499 is equal to 99139 in base-18.",
