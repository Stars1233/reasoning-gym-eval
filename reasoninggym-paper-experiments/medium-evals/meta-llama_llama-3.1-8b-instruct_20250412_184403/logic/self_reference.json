However, it contradicts Statement 1 because only 1 statement is true, not at least 6.\n- Statement 6 and Statement 7 can be ignored because they do not provide any new information about the number of true or false statements.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements.
