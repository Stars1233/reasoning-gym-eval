Matilda is one of these 6 female colleagues.\n\nNext, we can look at Thomas's colleagues: Thomas has 7 male colleagues and 1 female colleague. We know that Matilda is the only female colleague of Thomas aside from the people in the circle around him.\n\nSince Matilda is a colleague of both Mary and Thomas, and we know that Matilda is one of the 6 female colleagues of Mary, we can conclude that Matilda is also one of the 1 female colleagues of Thomas.\n\nHowever, we also know that the people in the circle around Thomas do not have other colleagues aside from Thomas and Matilda. This means that the 7 male colleagues of Thomas are not part of the circle around him.\n\nTherefore, the only female colleague of Thomas is Matilda.\n\nTo find out how many female colleagues Matilda has, we need to look at the colleagues of Mary.

Since Patricia has 5 male friends and 7 female friends, and they are all friends with each other, William has 5 male friends and 7 female friends. \n\nHowever, since William is a male friend of Patricia, he must be one of the 5 male friends Patricia has. So, he has 5 male friends (including himself) and 7 female friends. But since he is already counted among the male friends, we only consider the 7 female friends he has. \n\nSo, the answer is: 7",
