It seems the pattern of differences is not immediately clear, but upon closer inspection, it resembles a sequence where each term is the sum of the previous two differences (starting from the second term).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sequence and its pattern more closely:\n1. 10 + 10 = 20\n2. 10 + 20 = 30\n3. 20 + 30 = 50\n4. 30 + 50 = 80\nFollowing this pattern, the next sum should be:\n5. 50 + 80 = 130\n\nSo, the next number in the sequence should be 130.\n\n<answer>130</answer>",
