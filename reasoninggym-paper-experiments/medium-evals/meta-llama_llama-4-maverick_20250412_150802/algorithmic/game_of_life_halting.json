The \"game\" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The universe of the Game of Life is a two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or \"on\" and \"off\"). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the Initial Configuration\nThe given initial board is mostly empty (zeros) with a single cell being alive (1). The exact position of this alive cell isn't specified, but for the purpose of this analysis, we can consider it to be at any arbitrary position since the grid is large and the specific location of the single alive cell isn't given.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Game of Life Rules to the Initial Configuration\nGiven that there's only one alive cell, it has no alive neighbours because it's the only alive cell on the grid. According to the rules of the Game of Life:\n- A live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies. Since our cell has 0 live neighbours, it will die.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the Outcome\nAfter the first step, the alive cell will die because it has no neighbours. Thus, the grid will become completely dead (all zeros) after the first step. Since there are no alive cells left after the first generation, the game halts.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nThe game halts at the first step because the single alive cell dies due to underpopulation. Therefore, it will halt well before 50 steps.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The rules for the next state of a cell are:\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the rules to the initial condition.\nSince the initial board is entirely filled with zeros (dead cells) and there are no live cells, there are no cells to apply the rules to in terms of changing their state from alive to dead or vice versa based on the number of live neighbours.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the outcome based on the initial condition.\nWith no live cells initially, there are no live cells to die or stay alive. Moreover, since there are no live cells, there are no cells that can be born (as the condition for a dead cell to become alive requires exactly three live neighbours, which is not met here).\n\n## Step 5: Consider the definition of the game halting.\nThe game halts if there are no cells alive. Initially, there are no cells alive.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the future state of the game.\nGiven that there are no live cells and the rules of the Game of Life, the state of the grid will remain the same (all zeros) because there are no live cells to start with, and no dead cell has three live neighbours to become alive.\n\n## Step 7: Determine if the game will halt at or before 50 steps.\nSince the grid is initially empty (all cells are dead), it meets the condition for the game to be considered halted (no cells alive).

Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n3.

An alive cell stays alive if it has 2 or 3 alive neighbors; otherwise, it dies.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the rules to the initial condition.\nSince the initial board is entirely filled with 0s (dead cells), there are no alive cells to begin with. Thus, there are no cells that can be born or die because there are no alive cells to start the process.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the outcome based on the initial condition and the rules.\nGiven that there are no alive cells initially, the grid will remain in the same state (all cells dead) for all subsequent steps because there are no alive cells to apply the rules to, and no dead cell has 3 alive neighbors to become alive.\n\n## Step 5: Assess if the game will halt.\nThe game is considered halted if there are no cells alive. Since the grid starts with no alive cells and remains that way, it is already in a halted state.\n\n## Step 6: Decide if the halt occurs at or before 50 steps.\nThe game is halted from the very beginning (step 0), so it is halted well before 50 steps.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The universe of the Game of Life is a two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or \"on\" and \"off\"). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the Initial Board\nThe given initial board is a grid filled with zeros, indicating that all cells are dead. \n\n## Step 3: Apply Game of Life Rules to the Initial Board\nSince all cells are dead (0), there are no live cells to start with. According to the rules of the Game of Life, a dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly three live neighbours. However, in this case, there are no live cells, so there are no cells with three live neighbours. Therefore, no cell will become alive in the next generation.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the Outcome\nGiven that there are no live cells initially and the rules of the Game of Life do not allow any cell to become alive without live neighbours, the grid will remain in the same state (all cells dead) for all subsequent generations. This means the game is effectively halted from the start because there are no cells alive.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nSince the game is halted from the beginning (no live cells), it is considered halted at step 0, which is before 50 steps.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The universe of the Game of Life is a two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or \"on\" and \"off\"). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the Initial Board\nThe given initial board is a grid filled with zeros, indicating that all cells are dead. \n\n## Step 3: Apply Game of Life Rules to the Initial Board\nSince all cells are dead (0), there are no live cells to start with. According to the rules of the Game of Life, a dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly three live neighbours. However, in this case, there are no live cells, so there are no cells with three live neighbours. Therefore, no cell will become alive in the next generation.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the Outcome\nGiven that there are no live cells initially and the rules of the Game of Life do not allow any cell to become alive without live neighbours, the grid will remain in the same state (all cells dead) for all subsequent generations. This means the game is effectively halted from the start because there are no cells alive.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nSince the game is halted from the beginning (no live cells), it is considered halted at step 0, which is before 50 steps.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

A dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly 3 alive neighbors. An alive cell stays alive if it has 2 or 3 alive neighbors; otherwise, it dies.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the rules to the initial condition.\nSince the initial board is completely filled with dead cells (0s), there are no alive cells to start with. Thus, there are no cells that can be born or die because there are no alive cells to begin with, and there are no configurations of alive cells that can lead to the birth of new cells.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the Moore neighborhood and wrapping topology.\nThe Moore neighborhood means that a cell is considered to have 8 neighbors (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent cells). The wrapping topology means that cells on the edge of the grid are considered to be adjacent to cells on the opposite edge. However, since there are no alive cells, the specifics of the neighborhood and topology do not affect the outcome.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the outcome based on the initial condition.\nGiven that there are no alive cells initially, the grid will remain in the same state (all cells dead) for all subsequent steps because there are no alive cells to die or be born.\n\n## Step 6: Decide if the game will halt at or before 50 steps.\nThe game is considered halted if there are no cells alive. Since there are no alive cells at the start and this condition does not change, the game is effectively halted from the beginning.\n\n## Step 7: Conclude based on the definition of halting.\nThe game halts if there are no alive cells. Since the grid starts with no alive cells and remains so, it is considered halted.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate if the halting occurs at or before 50 steps.\nThe game is halted at step 0 (the initial condition), which is before 50 steps.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",
