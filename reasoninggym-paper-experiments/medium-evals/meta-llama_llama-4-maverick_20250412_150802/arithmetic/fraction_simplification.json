The last non-zero remainder is 24, so the GCD of 17856 and 63864 is 24.\n\n## Step 14: Simplify the fraction using the GCD.\nTo simplify $\\frac{17856}{63864}$, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 24. So, $\\frac{17856 \\div 24}{63864 \\div 24} = \\frac{744}{2661}$.\n\n## Step 15: Check if the fraction $\\frac{744}{2661}$ can be simplified further.\nWe need to find the GCD of 744 and 2661 to check if $\\frac{744}{2661}$ is in its lowest terms.\n\n## Step 16: Calculate the GCD of 744 and 2661.\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm: $2661 = 3 \\times 744 + 429$, $744 = 1 \\times 429 + 315$, $429 = 1 \\times 315 + 114$, $315 = 2 \\times 114 + 87$, $114 = 1 \\times 87 + 27$, $87 = 3 \\times 27 + 6$, $27 = 4 \\times 6 + 3$, $6 = 2 \\times 3 + 0$. The GCD is 3.\n\n## Step 17: Simplify $\\frac{744}{2661}$ using the GCD found in Step 16.\n$\\frac{744 \\div 3}{2661 \\div 3} = \\frac{248}{887}$.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>\\frac{248}{887}</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: To simplify the fraction $\\frac{7150}{16475}$, we first need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator.\nThe GCD is the largest number that divides both the numerator and the denominator without leaving a remainder.\n\n## Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 7150 and 16475.\nTo start, we divide the larger number by the smaller number and then continue the process with the smaller number and the remainder until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.\nFirst, divide 16475 by 7150: $16475 = 2 \\times 7150 + 2175$.\n\n## Step 4: Continue the Euclidean algorithm with 7150 and 2175.\n$7150 = 3 \\times 2175 + 625$.\n\n## Step 5: Continue the Euclidean algorithm with 2175 and 625.\n$2175 = 3 \\times 625 + 300$.\n\n## Step 6: Continue the Euclidean algorithm with 625 and 300.\n$625 = 2 \\times 300 + 25$.\n\n## Step 7: Continue the Euclidean algorithm with 300 and 25.\n$300 = 12 \\times 25 + 0$.\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder, which is 25, is the GCD of 7150 and 16475.\n\n## Step 8: Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{7150 \\div 25}{16475 \\div 25} = \\frac{286}{659}$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify if $\\frac{286}{659}$ is in its lowest terms by checking if 286 and 659 have any common factors other than 1.\n286 = 2 * 11 * 13 and 659 is a prime number. Since they do not share any common factors, $\\frac{286}{659}$ is indeed in its lowest terms.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>$\\frac{286}{659}$</answer>",
