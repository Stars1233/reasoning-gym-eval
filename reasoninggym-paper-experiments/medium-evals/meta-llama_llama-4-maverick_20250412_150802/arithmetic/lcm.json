Let's start with the given numbers: 9026, 9275, and 5786.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 9026\nFirst, we break down 9026 into its prime factors. 9026 = 2 * 4513. Further breaking down 4513, we find it is a product of 13 and 347 (4513 = 13 * 347), so 9026 = 2 * 13 * 347.\n\n## Step 4: Factorize 9275\nNext, we break down 9275 into its prime factors. 9275 = 5 * 5 * 371. Further, 371 = 53 * 7, so 9275 = 5^2 * 7 * 53.\n\n## Step 5: Factorize 5786\nNow, we break down 5786 into its prime factors. 5786 = 2 * 2893.

The unique prime factors are 2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 53, 263, and 347. Their highest powers among the factorizations are: 2^1, 5^2, 7^1, 11^1, 13^1, 53^1, 263^1, and 347^1.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the LCM\nTo find the LCM, we multiply these prime factors raised to their highest powers: LCM = 2^1 * 5^2 * 7^1 * 11^1 * 13^1 * 53^1 * 263^1 * 347^1.\n\n## Step 8: Perform the multiplication\nLCM = 2 * 25 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 53 * 263 * 347.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the product\nLet's calculate the product step by step:\n- 2 * 25 = 50\n- 50 * 7 = 350\n- 350 * 11 = 3850\n- 3850 * 13 = 50050\n- 50050 * 53 = 2652650\n- 2652650 * 263 = 697646950\n- 697646950 * 347 = 242083491650\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>242083491650</answer>",

Let's start with 3033, 5589, and 5956.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 3033\nTo factorize 3033, we break it down into its prime factors. 3033 = 3 * 1011. Further breaking down 1011, we get 1011 = 3 * 337. So, 3033 = 3^2 * 337.\n\n## Step 4: Factorize 5589\nFor 5589, breaking it down into its prime factors, we find 5589 = 3 * 1863. Further, 1863 = 3 * 621, and 621 = 3 * 207. Then, 207 = 3 * 69, and 69 = 3 * 23. So, 5589 = 3^5 * 23.\n\n## Step 5: Factorize 5956\nFor 5956, we start by dividing it by 2 (since it's even), giving 5956 = 2 * 2978. Continuing, 2978 = 2 * 1489. Since 1489 is a prime number, we have 5956 = 2^2 * 1489.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the prime factors of each number\n- 3033 = 3^2 * 337\n- 5589 = 3^5 * 23\n- 5956 = 2^2 * 1489\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the LCM using the prime factors\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number from the factorizations.\n- The prime 2 appears with the highest power of 2 in 5956.\n- The prime 3 appears with the highest power of 5 in 5589.\n- The prime 23 appears in 5589.\n- The prime 337 appears in 3033.\n- The prime 1489 appears in 5956.\n\n## Step 8: Compute the LCM\nLCM = 2^2 * 3^5 * 23 * 337 * 1489.\n\n## Step 9: Perform the multiplication\nCalculating the LCM: 2^2 = 4, 3^5 = 243, 23, 337, and 1489 are primes. So, LCM = 4 * 243 * 23 * 337 * 1489.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the product\n4 * 243 = 972, 972 * 23 = 22356, 22356 * 337 = 7533972, and 7533972 * 1489 = 11217082308.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>11217082308</answer>",
