April has 30 days, so from April 21 to April 30, there are 9 days. May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, and from August 1 to August 15, there are 15 days. Thus, the total number of days from April 21 to August 15 is 9 (remaining days in April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 15 (days in August up to the 15th) = 116 days.\n\n## Step 3: Include both the start and end dates in the count\nSince we are counting both the start and end dates, we need to add 1 to the total count of days. So, the total number of days is 116.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) within the period\nFrom April 21 to August 15, we need to count the number of Saturdays and Sundays. April 2022: 23, 24; May 2022: 1, 7, 8, 14, 15, 21, 22, 28, 29; June 2022: 4, 5, 11, 12, 18, 19, 25, 26; July 2022: 2, 3, 9, 10, 16, 17, 23, 24, 30, 31; August 2022: 6, 7, 13, 14. Counting these: April (2), May (9), June (8), July (10), August (4) gives a total of 2 + 9 + 8 + 10 + 4 = 33 weekend days.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total count of business days\nThe total number of days between April 21 and August 15, including both dates, is 116. The number of weekend days is 33. Therefore, the total count of business days (Monday through Friday) is 116 - 33 = 83.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>83</answer>",

Thus, the total number of days from April 21 to August 15 is 9 (remaining days in April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 15 (days in August up to the 15th) = 116 days.\n\n## Step 3: Include both the start and end dates in the count\nSince we are counting both the start and end dates, we need to add 1 to the total count of days.

So, the total number of days in these months is 31 + 30 + 31 = 92 days.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of days in August from August 1 to August 24\nAugust has 24 days from August 1 to August 24.\n\n## Step 7: Sum the days from step 4, step 5, and step 6 to get the total number of days\nTotal days = 27 (remaining days in April) + 92 (days in May, June, July) + 24 (days in August up to August 24) = 143 days.\n\n## Step 8: Count the number of Tuesdays between April 4, 2022, and August 24, 2022\nSince April 4 is a Monday, the first Tuesday is April 5. We need to count the Tuesdays from April 5 to August 23.\n\n## Step 9: List the Tuesdays or calculate them\nThe Tuesdays are April 5, April 12, April 19, April 26, May 3, May 10, May 17, May 24, May 31, June 7, June 14, June 21, June 28, July 5, July 12, July 19, July 26, August 2, August 9, August 16, August 23.\n\n## Step 10: Count the number of Tuesdays\nCounting the Tuesdays listed in step 9: 1. April 5, 2. April 12, 3. April 19, 4. April 26, 5. May 3, 6. May 10, 7. May 17, 8. May 24, 9. May 31, 10. June 7, 11. June 14, 12. June 21, 13. June 28, 14. July 5, 15. July 12, 16. July 19, 17.

Zeller's Congruence is given by the formula: $h = (q + \\lfloor\\frac{13(m+1)}{5}\\rfloor + K + \\lfloor\\frac{K}{4}\\rfloor + \\lfloor\\frac{J}{4}\\rfloor - 2J) \\mod 7$, where $h$ is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, ..., 6 = Friday), $q$ is the day of the month, $m$ is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 12 = December, 13 = January, 14 = February), $K$ is the year of the century ($year \\mod 100$), and $J$ is the zero-based century ($year / 100$). For February 25, 2022, $q = 25$, $m = 14$ (since February is considered as the 14th month of the previous year in Zeller's Congruence), $K = 21$ (because $2022 \\mod 100 = 22$ but we need to adjust our understanding for $m = 14$, so we actually use $K = 21$ for the year 2021), and $J = 20$ (because $2022 / 100 = 20.22$, so $J = 20$).\n\n## Step 4: Adjust the values according to Zeller's Congruence for February\nFor February 25, 2022, we adjust our values: $q = 25$, $m = 14$, $year = 2021$ for the formula (since we're treating it as the 14th month of 2021), so $K = 21$ and $J = 20$.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Identify the date in question\nThe date given is February 25, 2022.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the method to find the weekday\nTo find the weekday of a specific date, we can use Zeller's Congruence formula or simply check a calendar for the year 2022.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Zeller's Congruence or check a calendar\nFor simplicity and accuracy, checking a calendar or using a known method like Zeller's Congruence can directly give us the day of the week. Zeller's Congruence is given by the formula: $h = (q + \\lfloor\\frac{13(m+1)}{5}\\rfloor + K + \\lfloor\\frac{K}{4}\\rfloor + \\lfloor\\frac{J}{4}\\rfloor - 2J) \\mod 7$, where $h$ is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, ..., 6 = Friday), $q$ is the day of the month, $m$ is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 12 = December, 13 = January, 14 = February), $K$ is the year of the century ($year \\mod 100$), and $J$ is the zero-based century ($year / 100$). For February 25, 2022, $q = 25$, $m = 14$ (since February is considered as the 14th month of the previous year in Zeller's Congruence), $K = 21$ (because $2022 \\mod 100 = 22$ but we need to adjust our understanding for $m = 14$, so we actually use $K = 21$ for the year 2021), and $J = 20$ (because $2022 / 100 = 20.22$, so $J = 20$).\n\n## Step 4: Adjust the values according to Zeller's Congruence for February\nFor February 25, 2022, we adjust our values: $q = 25$, $m = 14$, $year = 2021$ for the formula (since we're treating it as the 14th month of 2021), so $K = 21$ and $J = 20$. Thus, $h = (25 + \\lfloor\\frac{13(14+1)}{5}\\rfloor + 21 + \\lfloor\\frac{21}{4}\\rfloor + \\lfloor\\frac{20}{4}\\rfloor - 2*20) \\mod 7$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the Zeller's Congruence calculation\nCalculate $h = (25 + \\lfloor\\frac{13*15}{5}\\rfloor + 21 + \\lfloor\\frac{21}{4}\\rfloor + \\lfloor\\frac{20}{4}\\rfloor - 40) \\mod 7$.\n$h = (25 + \\lfloor\\frac{195}{5}\\rfloor + 21 + 5 + 5 - 40) \\mod 7$.\n$h = (25 + 39 + 21 + 5 + 5 - 40) \\mod 7$.\n$h = (55) \\mod 7$.\n$h = 6$.\n\n## Step 6: Interpret the result of Zeller's Congruence\n$h = 6$ corresponds to Friday, since $h = 0$ is Saturday, $h = 1$ is Sunday, and so on, until $h = 6$ which is Friday.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>Friday</answer>",

August has 31 days, so subtracting the remaining days in August (0, since we're starting on the 31st) and then moving into July, June, May, and part of April or directly calculating gives us the date.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the date calculation\nAugust 31, 2022 - 100 days = May 23, 2022. To verify: August (0 days remaining) + July (31 days) + June (30 days) + May (31 days) = 92 days. So, from August 31, going back 92 days lands on May 31. Then, going back 8 more days (to complete 100 days) from May 31: May 31 - 8 days = May 23.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the weekday of May 23, 2022\nNow, we need to find out what weekday May 23, 2022, was.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the weekday\nAugust 31, 2022, is a Wednesday. To find the weekday 100 days before, we can use the fact that 100 mod 7 = 2 (since there are 7 days in a week). This means we go back 2 days in the week from Wednesday.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the weekday calculation\nWednesday (August 31) - 2 days = Monday.\n\nThe answer is <answer>Monday</answer>.",

The Tuesday immediately before July 2 is June 28, and the next Tuesday after June 28 is July 5, which is beyond our end date.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of Tuesdays between April 12 and June 28\nTo find the number of Tuesdays, we calculate the number of weeks between April 12 and June 28, and then check if there's an additional Tuesday.\n\n## Step 6: Count the weeks from April 12 to June 28\nApril 12 to April 19 is 1 week, April 19 to June 28 is the remaining period. We count the Tuesdays: April 12, April 19, April 26, May 3, May 10, May 17, May 24, May 31, June 7, June 14, June 21, June 28. This gives us a total count.\n\n## Step 7: Count the total number of Tuesdays\nCounting the Tuesdays: April 12, April 19, April 26, May 3, May 10, May 17, May 24, May 31, June 7, June 14, June 21, June 28, we find there are 12 Tuesdays.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>12</answer>",
