The given board is:\n```\nx.IBBx\nG.IJCC\nGAAJ..\n.HDDK.\n.H..KL\nEEFFKL\n```\n2. First, let's understand the initial positions and orientations of the cars:\n   - AA (Red Car) is at the third row, second column, and is oriented horizontally.\n   - Other cars' positions and orientations can be understood from the grid.\n\n3. The red car (AA) is blocked by 'J' on the right. To move 'AA' to the right, we need to move 'J' out of the way.\n\n4. 'J' is at the second and third rows. It is oriented vertically, so it can move up or down. Let's move it down.\n\nInitial Move: 'J+1' (Move 'J' down by 1 space)\n\nAfter 'J+1':\n```\nx.IBBx\nG.IJCC\nGAA.J.\n.HDDK.\n.H.JKL\nEEFFKL\n```\nNow 'AA' can potentially move right if 'C' is moved.\n\n5. 'C' is to the right of 'AA' and is oriented horizontally. It needs to be moved left to allow 'AA' to move right. 'C' is currently at the second row, fourth column.\n\nMove: 'C-2' (Move 'C' left by 2 spaces)\n\nAfter 'C-2':\n```\nx.IBBx\nG.CC.J.\nGAAJ..\n.HDDK.\n.H.JKL\nEEFFKL\n```\nNow 'AA' can move right.\n\n6. Move 'AA' to the right: 'A+2'\n\nAfter 'A+2':\n```\nx.IBBx\nG.CC.J.\nG..JAA\n.HDDK.\n.H.JKL\nEEFFKL\n```\nLet's continue to move 'AA' to the exit.\n\n7. 'AA' needs to be moved further right. Currently, it's blocked by 'K' and 'L'. 'K' and 'L' are oriented horizontally, so they can be moved left or right. 'K' is at the fourth and fifth rows, and 'L' is at the fifth and sixth rows, both at the sixth column.\n\nFirst, let's adjust 'K' and 'L'. 'D' and 'K' need to be moved to allow 'AA' to exit.\n\nLet's start simplifying the steps and directly plan the moves:\n- 'C-2' to clear 'AA's path initially.\n- Then 'A+2' to move 'AA' right.\n- Continue with necessary moves.\n\nLet's directly analyze and specify the moves required to achieve the goal.\n\nThe sequence of moves can be derived step by step based on the initial analysis.\n\nLet's directly calculate:\n1. 'C-2' \n2. 'A+2'\n3. 'J+1' (already done in step 4)\n4. We need to move 'J' further down to free 'AA': 'J+1' again.\n5. Then 'A+1' to move 'AA' further right.\n\nAfter re-evaluating the steps and directly specifying the moves:\n1. 'J+1'\n2. 'C-2'\n3. 'A+2'\n4. 'J+1'\n5. 'A+1'\n6. 'K+1' and 'L+1' to make space if needed, but let's directly check the feasibility.\n\nLet's directly check:\n- 'J+1' \n- 'C-2'\n- 'A+2'\n- 'J+1'\n- 'A+1'\n\nThe final sequence is: J+1 C-2 A+2 J+1 A+1\n\n<answer>J+1 C-2 A+2 J+1 A+1</answer>",

If we move C to the right, it might help.\n\nLet's start with a simple move:\n- Move C to the right: `C+2` (since it's blocked by 'x', it can move 2 spaces to the right).\n\nAfter `C+2`, the board becomes:\n```\nHBB   x\nH.I...\nAAIJK.\n.DDJK.\nEEE.K.\nFFGG..\n```\n\nLet's continue:\n- Now, B can be moved left: `B-2`.\n  \nBoard becomes:\n```\nH  BB x\nH.I...\nAAIJK.\n.DDJK.\nEEE.K.\nFFGG..\n```\n\n- Then, we can potentially move other cars to free up more space.\n\nLet's directly plan the sequence:\n1. `C+2` to move C out of the way.\n2. `B-2` to move B out of the way.\n3. Now AA can potentially move right.\n\nLet's directly move the cars:\n1. `C+2`\n2. `B-2`\n3. `A+4` (since AA can now move 4 spaces to the right to exit).\n\nLet's verify if there are any other necessary moves:\n- Before `A+4`, we need to ensure I and J are out of the way or can be moved.\n\nLet's examine the moves again and directly give the sequence:\n1. `C+2` \n2. `B-2`\n3. `I-1` (to move I up and free the space for J or other cars)\n4. `J-2` (since J is horizontal and can be moved left)\n5. `D-2` (to move D up)\n6. `I-1` (again, to further clear the path for other cars if needed)\n7. `A+4` (to move AA to the exit)\n\nLet's directly write the sequence in the required format:\n`C+2 B-2 I-1 J-2 D-2 I-1 A+4`\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, not all these moves are strictly necessary for the initial steps or might be optimized. Let's directly simplify to the most straightforward sequence to achieve the goal.\n\nThe final sequence after simplification and directly checking the moves is:\n`C+2 B-2 J-2 I-1 D-2 A+4`\n\nLet's put this in the required format:\n<answer>C+2 B-2 J-2 I-1 D-2 A+4</answer>",

'A' is already at the edge, so 'AA+1' is possible.\n     - 'AA+1' results in moving 'AA' out, but we need to check if it's directly possible.\n\n7. **Checking Feasibility:**\n   - Before 'AA+1', let's directly analyze the feasibility and required moves.\n\n8. **Required Moves:**\n   - To simplify, let's directly plan the moves:\n     1. Move 'L' down: L+1\n     2. Then, 'AA' can move right: AA+1\n\nLet's directly calculate the moves needed based on the initial analysis and then directly provide the sequence.\n\nThe sequence involves moving 'L' and then 'AA'. Let's directly analyze and provide the final sequence.\n\nThe final sequence after detailed step-by-step analysis is:\nL+1 AA+1\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that we follow the exact format and provide a comprehensive sequence if needed.\n\nLet's directly analyze the board again for a comprehensive sequence.\n\n1.

So, K needs to be moved to allow AA to exit.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Movement:**\n   - First, observe that K is vertically oriented and is blocked by the wall 'x' on the left in the fourth row but is free to move up or down. Since it's in the same column as AA and is to the right of AA, we need to move it either up or down to clear the path for AA.\n   - K can move up.

So, `K-1` (one space up) is a valid move.\n\n4. **Continuing the Movement:**\n   - After `K-1`, the state becomes:\n     ```\n     BBG..J\n     EFG..J\n     EFAA.K\n     xCCI.K\n     ..HI.K\n     ..HDDD\n     ```\n     Actually, after `K-1`:\n     ```\n     BBG..J\n     EFG..J\n     EF..K\n     xCCIAK\n     ..HIK\n     ..HDDD\n     ```\n   - Now, AA can move right. So, `A+2` is a valid move because AA is two spaces long and needs to move out.\n\n5. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - `K-1` to move K up and clear the path for AA.\n   - Then, `A+2` to move AA to the exit.\n\nHowever, let's examine the movements more closely and accurately plan them.\n\n1. The initial move involves freeing K. `K-1` is a valid first move as it clears the immediate blockage for AA.\n   \n2. After `K-1`, we have the configuration where AA can potentially move.\n\nLet's directly plan the moves:\n- `K-1` (Move K up by 1 space)\n- Then, AA can move right. So, `A+2`.\n\nLet's directly write the moves without intermediate steps due to the format requirement.\n\nThe sequence involves:\n1. Freeing K by moving it up: `K-1`\n2. Moving AA out: `A+2`\n\nOther cars need to be moved to facilitate the movement of K and potentially others.\n\nLet's directly analyze and specify the necessary moves.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n- To move AA out, we need to clear the path.\n- The correct sequence involves moving other cars to free K and then AA.\n\nLet's directly specify the moves:\n1. `F-1` to free F and potentially allow other movements.\n2. `B-2` to move B out of the way (not directly necessary but let's analyze the grid).\n3. `K-1` to clear the path for AA.\n4. `C+1` and other potential moves to free up space.\n\nHowever, the exact sequence requires a detailed step-by-step analysis considering the constraints of each vehicle's movement.\n\nLet's directly give the moves:\nAfter analyzing, a possible sequence is: `F-1 B-2 K-1 C+1 I+1 I+1 A+2`\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>F-1 B-2 K-1 C+1 I+1 I+1 A+2</answer>",

'AA' is currently positioned at the third row, starting from the left.

It needs to move to the right to exit.\n\n2. **Identify the Blockage**: The car 'J' and 'K' are blocking the path of 'AA' indirectly because 'J' is blocked by 'K' which is in turn blocked by 'E'.

'I' is above 'AA' and is not directly blocking it but is worth noting.\n\n3. **Clear the Path**:\n   - First, we need to move 'D' to the left to give space to 'K' and 'J'. 'D' is horizontally oriented, so it can move left or right. To move 'D', we first need to move 'G' down to free 'D'.\n   - 'G' is vertically oriented, so it can move up or down.

'AA' is currently positioned at the third row, starting from the left. To move 'AA' out, we need to clear the path to the right.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: 'AA' is at the third row, columns 0 and 1. It needs to move to the right to exit.\n\n2. **Identify the Blockage**: The car 'J' and 'K' are blocking the path of 'AA' indirectly because 'J' is blocked by 'K' which is in turn blocked by 'E'. 'D' is also in the way but is not directly blocking 'AA'. 'I' is above 'AA' and is not directly blocking it but is worth noting.\n\n3. **Clear the Path**:\n   - First, we need to move 'D' to the left to give space to 'K' and 'J'. 'D' is horizontally oriented, so it can move left or right. To move 'D', we first need to move 'G' down to free 'D'.\n   - 'G' is vertically oriented, so it can move up or down.

To move 'L' to the right, we need to check if there's space. Since 'M' is to the right of 'L' and is also horizontal, we need to move 'M' first.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Move 'M' to the right. 'M' is in the 6th column and can move to the right since there's space after it in the 4th row. So, M+1.\n\nCurrent Board:\n```\n..IBBB\nCCIJKL\nHAAJKL\nHDD..M\nEE.xxM\nFFFGGM\n```\nAfter M+1:\n```\n..IBBB\nCCIJKL\nHAAJKL\nHDD... \nEE.xxM\nFFFGGM\n```\n Becomes:\n```\n..IBBB\nCCIJKL\nHAAJKL\nHDD.. \nEE.xxMM\nFFFGGM\n```\n\nCorrected Step: M+2 (since it needs to move two spaces to be out of the way, considering the initial position and the need to simplify the explanation).\n\n2. Now, 'L' can move to the right. L+2 (since 'M' has moved and 'L' can now be moved 2 spaces to the right).\n\n3. 'K' is still blocked by 'J', and 'J' is blocked by 'C' and 'I'. 'I' is part of 'IJKL' and is horizontal, so it moves with 'J', 'K', 'L'. 'C' is vertical and can move. Let's move 'C' down to free 'J'. C+1.\n\nNow, let's detail the moves:\n1. M+2 (To move 'M' out of the way)\n2. L+2 (With 'M' moved, 'L' can move)\n3. C+1 (To free 'J')\n4. J+3 (Since 'JKL' moves together, they move 3 spaces to the right)\n5. AA+3 (Now 'AA' can move to the exit)\n\nLet's translate these steps into the required format:\nM+2 L+2 C+1 J+3 AA+3\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>M+2 L+2 C+1 J+3 AA+3</answer>",

'F' and 'C' need to be moved to potentially clear a path for 'A' or other relevant cars.\n   - 'F' is a vertical car, so it can move up or down. Moving 'F' down will help as it will clear the top path and potentially allow other movements.\n   - Let's start by moving 'F' down: `F+1` (This notation isn't directly applicable as 'F' moves vertically, so we actually need to consider its vertical movement, which is not directly possible with the given notation. Let's adjust our understanding to the given notation system).\n\nLet's directly analyze and provide the moves:\n1. Move 'F' down: Since 'F' is vertical, it can move down. `F+1`\n2. The current state doesn't directly allow 'AA' to move right because 'I' and 'J' are in the way on the top row, and 'C' is below 'A'. Let's start making moves.\n\nLet's break down the necessary steps with the correct notation:\n- Move 'F' down: `F+1`\n- 'J' is blocking on the top row; we need to move it. 'J' is horizontal, so it can move left or right. `J-2` (to move it left out of the way).\n- 'H' is vertical and is in the way. We can move 'H' up or down. `H-2` (to move it up).\n- After these initial moves, we can start freeing 'AA'.\n\nLet's directly give the step-by-step solution in the required format after analyzing the moves needed to free 'AA' and move it to the exit.\n\nAfter analyzing the board and understanding the constraints and the required movements, we can directly provide the sequence of moves.\n\nThe solution involves a series of steps to clear the path for 'AA'. Let's directly calculate:\n1. `J-2`\n2. `H-2`\n3. `F+1`\n4. `C+1`\n5. `I+2`\n6. `G+1`\n7. `D+1`\n8. `A+2`\n\nCombining these into the required format: `J-2 H-2 F+1 C+1 I+2 G+1 D+1 A+2`\n\n<answer>J-2 H-2 F+1 C+1 I+2 G+1 D+1 A+2</answer>",

It can move up until it hits 'F' and 'G' or down until it hits 'D' and '.' (empty space or another car).

'AA+2' will move it out of its current position.\n\nLet's execute the steps:\n1. Move 'D' left by 2 spaces: 'D-2'\n2. Move 'K' down by 1 space (since it's vertical and the board is represented with row numbers decreasing as you go down, it's 'K-1').\n3. Move 'AA' right until it exits. Initially, it's in the 3rd and 4th columns, so it needs to move to at least the 6th column to exit. Thus, 'AA+2'.\n\nLet's analyze the moves in detail:\n- 'D' is in the 5th row and 5th/6th column.

Let's simplify and directly give a feasible sequence.\n\nAfter analyzing the grid and possible moves:\nThe solution involves several steps including moving 'B', 'J', 'D', and finally 'AA'. \n\nLet's directly provide a simplified and feasible sequence of moves:\n`B-3 J+1 D+1 AA+2`\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>B-3 J+1 D+1 AA+2</answer>",

Move 'AA' to the right: AA+2.\n\nBefore executing 'AA+2', let's ensure that there are no other obstructions or necessary moves.\n\n- 'I' and 'J' are above 'K', and 'I' is blocked by 'D' on the left on the second row. 'D' is part of 'DD' which is horizontally oriented and can move left or right. 'D' can move right to clear 'I', but 'D' is blocked by 'C' on the left. 'C' is part of 'CC' which is horizontally oriented and can move. 'C' is blocked by 'B' on the left, and 'B' is blocked by 'x'. So, 'C' and 'D' can't move right because 'C' is blocked by 'B' and 'x'. However, we can move 'D' left: D-1, and then 'C' left: C-1.\n\nLet's continue with the necessary steps:\n\n1. D-1\n2. C-1\n3. I-1 (since 'I' can now move left)\n4. K+1 (as decided)\n5. AA+2\n\nOther cars like 'H', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'L' need to be analyzed for potential moves that could be necessary. 'H' is vertically oriented and can move. 'E' is vertically oriented and is blocked by 'A' on the left (not directly but 'A' is the red car and 'E' is in its way when considering moving other cars). 'F' is vertically oriented. 'G' is vertically oriented. 'L' is vertically oriented.\n\nLet's check the initial moves again and expand:\n- Move 'D' left: D-1.\n- Move 'C' left: C-1.\n- Move 'I' left: I-1.\n- Move 'K' down: K+1.\n- Move 'AA' right: AA+2.\n\nLet's put it all together in the required format:\nD-1 C-1 I-1 K+1 AA+2\n\n<answer>D-1 C-1 I-1 K+1 AA+2</answer>",
