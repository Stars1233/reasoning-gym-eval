      "best_full_model_response": "To create an expression that equals 641 using the numbers 27, 94, 51, 35, 88, and 6, we need to think about the possible operations that can lead to this result.\n\nFirst, let's examine the numbers given and the target number 641. We can start by trying to get close to 641 using the larger numbers.\n\n1. We start with the largest numbers: 94, 88, 51, 35, 27, 6.\n2. Adding the largest numbers first: 94 + 88 + 51 + 35 + 27 + 6 = 301, which is less than 641. So, we need to consider multiplication to increase the value.\n3. Noting that 94 * 6 = 564, which is less than 641 but close.\n4. Adding the remaining numbers to 564: 564 + 51 = 615, 615 + 27 = 642, which is just 1 more than 641. We can adjust this by using 35 instead of 27 and then adjusting further.\n5. Let's directly try to form 641: Starting with 94 * 6 = 564, then adding 88 gives 652, which is too much. So, let's adjust our strategy.\n6. If we do 94 * 7 (but we don't have 7), we can't directly achieve this. However, we can try: 88 * 6 = 528, and then add other numbers.\n7. Trying a different combination: 88 + 94 + 35 + 27 = 244, and 244 * 6 = 1464, which is too large when divided by other numbers or subtracted by them directly.\n8. Let's directly form 641: Using the numbers given, if we try 94 + 51 + 88 + 35 + 27*6, it doesn't work directly because the operations aren't correctly ordered or it doesn't directly give 641.\n9. Evaluating: 88 + 51 + 94 + 27 = 260, and 260 * 6 = 1560 (too high), or using the numbers differently: 94 * 7 is not possible directly. However, 88 * 7 = 616 (if we had 7), is close. We can achieve a similar result using the available numbers.\n10. Let's directly check a possible combination: 94 + 88 = 182, 182 + 51 = 233, 233 * 3 (not available) is not possible. However, if we do 35 * 27 = 945 (too high), or other multiplications.\n11. Evaluating a promising expression: Using the numbers to get close to 641. Noting that 27 * 6 = 162 (a possible starting point), and then 94 + 88 + 51 + 35 + 162 (from 27*6) = 430, still too low.\n12. Another attempt: 88 * 7 is not directly possible, but 94 * 6 = 564. Then, 564 + 88 - 11 (not directly available) could be a strategy. However, we can do: 94 * 6 = 564, 51 + 35 = 86, 564 + 86 - 9 (not available) is not possible. But, 88 - 51 + 94 + 27*6 + 35 - 6 (using numbers more than once or not available numbers) is not valid.\n\nLet's directly form a valid expression:\nUsing the numbers given: 94*6 + 88 - 51 + 35*27/27 doesn't simplify to a valid expression directly, but adjusting our numbers: 94*6 = 564, and then 35 + 27 + 88 - 51 + 94 (using 94 again, which is not allowed) is not valid. However, a valid expression is: 88 + 94 + 351 + 27*6 - 27 (again, not valid due to repeated numbers).\n\nAfter trial and error, a valid expression is: 94*6 + 35 + 88 - 51 - 27 + 27*1 (again, not valid).

          "full_model_response": "To create an expression that equals 641 using the numbers 27, 94, 51, 35, 88, and 6, we need to think about the possible operations that can lead to this result.\n\nFirst, let's examine the numbers given and the target number 641. We can start by trying to get close to 641 using the larger numbers.\n\n1. We start with the largest numbers: 94, 88, 51, 35, 27, 6.\n2. Adding the largest numbers first: 94 + 88 + 51 + 35 + 27 + 6 = 301, which is less than 641. So, we need to consider multiplication to increase the value.\n3. Noting that 94 * 6 = 564, which is less than 641 but close.\n4. Adding the remaining numbers to 564: 564 + 51 = 615, 615 + 27 = 642, which is just 1 more than 641. We can adjust this by using 35 instead of 27 and then adjusting further.\n5. Let's directly try to form 641: Starting with 94 * 6 = 564, then adding 88 gives 652, which is too much. So, let's adjust our strategy.\n6. If we do 94 * 7 (but we don't have 7), we can't directly achieve this. However, we can try: 88 * 6 = 528, and then add other numbers.\n7. Trying a different combination: 88 + 94 + 35 + 27 = 244, and 244 * 6 = 1464, which is too large when divided by other numbers or subtracted by them directly.\n8. Let's directly form 641: Using the numbers given, if we try 94 + 51 + 88 + 35 + 27*6, it doesn't work directly because the operations aren't correctly ordered or it doesn't directly give 641.\n9. Evaluating: 88 + 51 + 94 + 27 = 260, and 260 * 6 = 1560 (too high), or using the numbers differently: 94 * 7 is not possible directly. However, 88 * 7 = 616 (if we had 7), is close. We can achieve a similar result using the available numbers.\n10. Let's directly check a possible combination: 94 + 88 = 182, 182 + 51 = 233, 233 * 3 (not available) is not possible. However, if we do 35 * 27 = 945 (too high), or other multiplications.\n11. Evaluating a promising expression: Using the numbers to get close to 641. Noting that 27 * 6 = 162 (a possible starting point), and then 94 + 88 + 51 + 35 + 162 (from 27*6) = 430, still too low.\n12. Another attempt: 88 * 7 is not directly possible, but 94 * 6 = 564. Then, 564 + 88 - 11 (not directly available) could be a strategy. However, we can do: 94 * 6 = 564, 51 + 35 = 86, 564 + 86 - 9 (not available) is not possible.

To get close to this number, we should look for large numbers or combinations that can sum up or multiply to get close to 352.\n\nLet's start with the largest numbers:\n- The number 88 appears twice. Using both gives us 88 + 88 = 176, which is less than 352.\n- Adding 64 to 176 gives us 240, still less than 352.\n- Adding 66 to 240 gives us 306, getting closer to 352.\n- We still need to reach 352, so we need 352 - 306 = 46.\n\nNow, let's see how we can make up 46 using the remaining numbers (20, 6, 6, 6). \n- We have 20, which is less than 46.\n- Adding 20 to some combination might work. If we add 20 to a number, we need 26 more to reach 46.\n- We can get 6 * (a certain number) or add/subtract the numbers. \n- Using the available numbers, a straightforward way to get 46 is by doing 20 + (one of the 6s) * (another number) or simply adding/subtracting the available numbers.\n\nLet's directly check a feasible combination:\n- We have 88 + 88 + 64 + 66 = 306.\n- To get to 352, we need an additional 46.\n- We can achieve 46 by doing 66 - 20 = 46. However, we can't use 66 again as it's already used. So, let's think differently.\n- An alternative is to directly form 352 or get close.\n\nLet's directly form an expression:\nUsing the numbers available, let's directly try to form an expression that gives 352.\n\nOne way to get 352 is by directly using the available numbers in operations:\n88 + 88 + 64 + 66 + 20 + 6 * (a number that when multiplied by 6 and added or subtracted gets us to 352 or close).\n\nLet's simplify:\n- We already know 88 + 88 + 64 + 66 = 306.\n- 306 + 20 = 326.\n- 326 + 6 * (a small number or directly 6) doesn't directly give 352. However, 326 + 26 = 352.\n\nLet's directly achieve 352:\n- 64 + 20 = 84.\n- 88 * 4 = 352. We can achieve 4 by doing 6 - (another smaller number or available numbers).\n\nLet's directly check:\n- 66 / 6 = 11.\n- 88 * (a certain operation) = 352. If we do 88 * 4, we get 352.\n\nLet's form 4:\n- We have 6, 6, and 6. We can do 6 + 6 / (a certain number) or simply use the numbers to get 4.\n- Doing 6 + 6 = 12 (too high), but 66 / 6 = 11 (too high as well).\n- Alternatively, 20 - 6 = 14 (too high), but if we do a different operation: we can achieve 4 by 6 - (a smaller number or a division result).\n\nTo form 4 using the available numbers:\n- We can do 66 / 6 = 11, then 20 - 11 = 9 (not 4, and too high).\n- Directly: 6 - (a division or a subtraction result).\n\nLet's directly achieve the target:\nIf we do 64 + 88 = 152, and then 152 + 20 = 172 (still too low), and then double it or get close.\n\nLet's directly check a feasible expression:\n88 * 6 - 64 - 66 + 20 + 66 + 64 / (a certain number) is not valid due to repetition.\n\nLet's directly form 352:\n- 64 * 6 = 384 (too high), subtracting a number from it could work.\n- 384 - 20 = 364 (too high), and then 364 - 6 = 358 (still too high), 358 - 6 = 352.\n\nThus, a valid expression is: 64 * 6 - 20 - 6 - 6\n\n<answer>64 * 6 - 20 - 6 - 6</answer>",
