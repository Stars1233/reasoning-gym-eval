So, the sum of the interior angles = (14-2)*180 = 12*180 = 2160.\n\n## Step 3: Sum the given 13 interior angles\nSum = 56.0 + 41.0 + 81.0 + 87.0 + 120.0 + 14.0 + 137.0 + 104.0 + 88.0 + 119.0 + 162.0 + 80.0 + 147.0.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the addition of the given angles\n56.0 + 41.0 = 97.0,\n97.0 + 81.0 = 178.0,\n178.0 + 87.0 = 265.0,\n265.0 + 120.0 = 385.0,\n385.0 + 14.0 = 399.0,\n399.0 + 137.0 = 536.0,\n536.0 + 104.0 = 640.0,\n640.0 + 88.0 = 728.0,\n728.0 + 119.0 = 847.0,\n847.0 + 162.0 = 1009.0,\n1009.0 + 80.0 = 1089.0,\n1089.0 + 147.0 = 1236.0.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the measure of the remaining interior angle\nThe remaining angle = Sum of all interior angles - Sum of the given 13 angles = 2160 - 1236.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the subtraction to find the remaining angle\nRemaining angle = 2160 - 1236 = 924.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>924</answer>",
