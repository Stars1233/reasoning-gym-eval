Add 1 for inclusive counting (but since both are Fridays, we already have 9 Fridays: June 3, June 10, June 17, June 24, July 1, July 8, July 15, July 22, July 29, August 5).\n\nBut let's check the counting:\n\n- June: 3, 10, 17, 24\n- July: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29\n- August: 5\n\nTotal Fridays: 1 (June 3) + 3 (June 10, 17, 24) + 5 (July 1, 8, 15, 22, 29) + 1 (August 5) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 Fridays.\n\n<answer>10</answer>",
