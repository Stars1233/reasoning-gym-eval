          "full_model_response": "To solve a 5x5x5 Rubik's cube, the general approach is:\n\n1. Solve the center pieces for all faces.\n2. Pair up the edge pieces.\n3. Solve the cube like a 3x3x3.\n\nHowever, providing a full, explicit, move-by-move solution for a specific 5x5x5 cube scramble requires either a physical cube or a digital solver to input the state and generate the solution. Since I cannot physically manipulate the cube or visually verify the state, I cannot produce an exact, step-by-step Singmaster solution for your specific configuration.\n\nIf you provide the cube state in a digital format that can be used in a 5x5x5 solver (such as the color order of each face), I could then interpret the results from a solver and write out the moves in Singmaster notation as per your requirements.\n\nSince you asked for an explicit solution in the format of \"U U\" instead of \"U2\", here\u2019s what you can do:\n\n1. Use an online 5x5x5 cube solver (such as https://rubiks-cube-solver.com/5x5x5/).\n2. Enter your cube\u2019s state as described.\n3. When the solver gives you the solution, convert all double moves (like \"U2\") into two single moves (\"U U\"), and all inverse moves (like \"U'\") into three single moves (\"U U U\"), as per your instructions.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can provide a *template* for how a solution would look in your required format, but not the actual solution for your specific cube state. Let me know if you\u2019d like this template or further guidance on using an online solver!\n\n<answer>\nI cannot provide an explicit Singmaster solution for your specific 5x5x5 cube state without digital solver output. Please use a 5x5x5 cube solver, then convert all moves to your specified format.\n</answer>",

Translating the cube's current state into a digital model.\n2. Using a 5x5 cube solver or manually planning out the solution (which can take hours and requires cube manipulation tools or simulators).\n3. Converting the optimal solution into Singmaster notation, with all moves written out individually (e.g., \"U U\" instead of \"U2\").\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that a 5x5 cube has many possible states and over 100 pieces, it is not feasible to produce an accurate, step-by-step solution sequence for your specific scramble without using a cube solver program.\n\nHowever, I can guide you on how to obtain such a solution:\n\n1. **Input the state into a 5x5 cube solver:** Use an online 5x5 (Professor's Cube) solver such as [https://ruwix.com/online-puzzle-simulators/5x5x5-rubiks-cube-simulator.php](https://ruwix.com/online-puzzle-simulators/5x5x5-rubiks-cube-simulator.php) or [https://www.cubing.net/5x5/solver/](https://www.cubing.net/5x5/solver/).\n2. **Set up the cube according to your provided layout:** Enter the colors for each face as you have described.\n3. **Generate the solution:** The solver will output a solution, typically in standard notation.\n4. **Convert to non-combined Singmaster notation:** If the solution says \"U2\", replace it with \"U U\". If it says \"Rw'\", write \"Rw Rw Rw\".\n\nIf you would like, you can paste the solution here and I can convert it to the requested format for you.\n\n<answer>Due to the complexity and the necessity for a specialized solver to process the exact cube state, I cannot provide a manual step-by-step Singmaster solution for your specific scramble. Please use an online 5x5 cube solver, then share the solution here for conversion to non-combined notation if needed.</answer>",
