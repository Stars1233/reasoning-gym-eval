Now, let's check if this is a valid solution:\n\n- There are 5 true statements, which matches Statement 3.\n- Both Statement 3 and 4 are true, so Statement 5 is false, which matches.\n- T is prime, Statement 6 is true.\n- F is 2 (not composite), so Statement 7 is false.\n- All the counts align.\n\nNow, is there any other possible value for \\( T \\)?\n\nLet's try \\( T = 2 \\):\n\n- F = 5\n- Statement 1: TRUE\n- Statement 2: \\( F \\leq 3 \\)? FALSE (F = 5)\n- Statement 3: FALSE\n- Statement 4: FALSE\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so \"either but not both\" is FALSE.\n- Statement 6: T = 2 (prime) \u2192 TRUE\n- Statement 7: F = 5 (not composite) \u2192 FALSE\n\nSo, True: 1,6 (2 total), False: 2,3,4,5,7 (5 total)\n\nBut Statement 1 says \"At least 2 are true\" (OK), but Statement 2 is false (since 5 > 3), which is correct.\n\nBut now, only 2 statements are true, which means Statement 6 is true (T = 2 is prime), but Statement 7 is false (F = 5 is not composite). Statement 3 and 4 are both false, so Statement 5 is false.\n\nBut Statement 3 says \"Exactly 5 are true\" (False, correct), Statement 4 says \"Exactly 2 are false\" (False, correct).\n\nBut the issue is with Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is false (which matches).\n\nSo, is this a valid solution?\n\nBut Statement 2: \"At most 3 are false\" -- but there are 5 false, so Statement 2 is false. That matches.\n\nSo, is this a possible solution? Let's check if all the conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut Statement 7: \"F is composite\" -- F = 5 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\nTrue: 1,6 \u2192 2\nFalse: 2,3,4,5,7 \u2192 5\n\nBut then Statement 1: \"At least 2 are true\" -- TRUE\n\nStatement 2: \"At most 3 are false\" -- FALSE\n\nStatement 3: \"Exactly 5 are true\" -- FALSE\n\nStatement 4: \"Exactly 2 are false\" -- FALSE\n\nStatement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 is true, but not both\" -- Both are false, so FALSE\n\nStatement 6: \"T is prime\" -- TRUE\n\nStatement 7: \"F is composite\" -- FALSE\n\nSo, the counts match, but let's check Statement 5 again: \"Either 3 or 4 is true, but not both\". Both are false, so Statement 5 is false, which is correct.\n\nBut let's check Statement 6: \"T is prime\" -- T = 2 is prime, so TRUE. Statement 7: \"F is composite\" -- F = 5 is not composite, so FALSE.\n\nSo, everything matches.\n\nBut now, let's try T = 3:\n\n- F = 4\n- Statement 1: T >= 2? TRUE\n- Statement 2: F <= 3? FALSE\n- Statement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n- Statement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n- Statement 6: T = 3 (prime)? TRUE\n- Statement 7: F = 4 (composite)? TRUE\n\nSo, TRUE: 1,6,7 \u2192 3\nFALSE: 2,3,4,5 \u2192 4\n\nBut now, Statement 1: At least 2 true -- TRUE\n\nStatement 2: At most 3 false -- FALSE (F = 4)\n\nStatement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n\nStatement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n\nStatement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n\nStatement 6: T = 3 is prime -- TRUE\n\nStatement 7: F = 4 is composite -- TRUE\n\nSo, is this valid?\n\nNow, let's try T = 4:\n\n- F = 3\n- Statement 1: T >= 2? TRUE\n- Statement 2: F <= 3? TRUE\n- Statement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n- Statement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n- Statement 6: T = 4 (not prime)?

FALSE\n\nSo, TRUE: 1,2 \u2192 2\nFALSE: 3,4,5,6,7 \u2192 5\n\nBut then, Statement 6: T = 4, not prime, so FALSE.\n\nNow, let's try T = 6:\n\n- F = 1\n- Statement 1: T >= 2? TRUE\n- Statement 2: F <= 3? TRUE\n- Statement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n- Statement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so FALSE\n- Statement 6: T = 6 (not prime)? FALSE\n- Statement 7: F = 1 (not composite)? FALSE\n\nSo, TRUE: 1,2 \u2192 2\nFALSE: 3,4,5,6,7 \u2192 5\n\nSo, only T = 2, 3, 5 are possible for T being prime.\n\nBut for T = 3:\n\n- TRUE: 1,6,7\n- So T = 3, but then Statement 6: \"T is prime\" -- TRUE (T = 3 is prime)\n- Statement 7: F = 4 (composite), so TRUE\n- Statement 1: T >= 2? TRUE\n- Statement 2: F <= 3? FALSE (F = 4)\n- Statement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n- Statement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so FALSE\n\nSo, TRUE: 1,6,7 (3)\nFALSE: 2,3,4,5 (4)\n\nSo, T = 3, F = 4\n\nBut now, Statement 7: \"F is composite\" -- F = 4, which is composite, so TRUE.\n\nIs this a valid solution? Let's check that the counts match.\n\n- Number of true statements: 3\n- Number of false statements: 4\n\nDoes this create any contradictions? Let's check Statement 2: \"At most 3 are false\" -- but there are 4 false, so Statement 2 is FALSE, which matches.\n\nStatement 3: \"Exactly 5 are true\" -- FALSE\n\nStatement 4: \"Exactly 2 are false\" -- FALSE\n\nStatement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n\nStatement 6: T = 3 (prime) -- TRUE\n\nStatement 7: F = 4 (composite) -- TRUE\n\nSo, is this a possible solution? Let's check the self-consistency:\n\n- Statement 1: TRUE (T = 3 >= 2)\n- Statement 2: FALSE (F = 4 > 3)\n- Statement 3: FALSE (T \u2260 5)\n- Statement 4: FALSE (F \u2260 2)\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n- Statement 6: TRUE\n- Statement 7: TRUE\n\nSo, the truth assignments are consistent with the statements.\n\nSo, possible values for T: 2, 3, 5.\n\nBut for T = 2:\n\n- TRUE: 1,6\n- FALSE: 2,3,4,5,7\n\nDoes Statement 6: T is prime? Yes (2)\n\nStatement 7: F = 5 (not composite), so FALSE\n\nSo, is this a possible solution? Let's check Statement 2: F = 5 > 3, so Statement 2 is FALSE.\n\nAll the rest match.\n\nSo, yes, T = 2 is possible.\n\nNow, for T = 3, we already checked.\n\nFor T = 5, we already checked.\n\nSo, let's check for T = 7:\n\n- F = 0\n- Statement 1: TRUE (T = 7 >= 2)\n- Statement 2: TRUE (F = 0 <= 3)\n- Statement 3: FALSE (T \u2260 5)\n- Statement 4: FALSE (F \u2260 2)\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n- Statement 6: T = 7 (prime) -- TRUE\n- Statement 7: F = 0 (not composite) -- FALSE\n\nSo, TRUE: 1,2,6 (3)\nFALSE: 3,4,5,7 (4)\n\nSo, T = 3 is also possible here.\n\nBut Statement 6: T = 7 is prime, so TRUE.\n\nStatement 7: F = 0 is not composite, so FALSE.\n\nSo, is this a possible solution? Let's see:\n\nTRUE: 1,2,6\n\nFALSE: 3,4,5,7\n\nBut now, number of true statements is 3, which matches Statement 6.\n\nBut Statement 2: F = 0 <= 3, so TRUE.\n\nStatement 1: T = 7 >= 2, so TRUE.\n\nStatement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n\nStatement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n\nStatement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n\nStatement 6: TRUE\n\nStatement 7: FALSE\n\nSo, yes, this is possible.\n\nThus, the possible number of solutions is **4**:\n\n- T = 2\n- T = 3\n- T = 5\n- T = 7\n\nBut let's check T = 7:\n\n- TRUE: 1,2,6\n- FALSE: 3,4,5,7\n\nSo, number of true statements: 3, but T = 7, which is a contradiction.\n\nWait, but T = 7 means all statements are true.\n\nBut then Statement 3: \"Exactly 5 are true\" -- FALSE\n\nBut if all statements are true, then Statement 3 must be TRUE. Contradiction.\n\nSo, T cannot be 7.\n\nTherefore, the possible number of solutions is **3**.\n\n<answer>3</answer>",

Now, let's check if this is a valid solution:\n\n- There are 5 true statements, which matches Statement 3.\n- Both Statement 3 and 4 are true, so Statement 5 is false, which matches.\n- T is prime, Statement 6 is true.\n- F is 2 (not composite), so Statement 7 is false.\n- All the counts align.\n\nNow, is there any other possible value for \\( T \\)?\n\nLet's try \\( T = 2 \\):\n\n- F = 5\n- Statement 1: TRUE\n- Statement 2: \\( F \\leq 3 \\)? FALSE (F = 5)\n- Statement 3: FALSE\n- Statement 4: FALSE\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so \"either but not both\" is FALSE.\n- Statement 6: T = 2 (prime) \u2192 TRUE\n- Statement 7: F = 5 (not composite) \u2192 FALSE\n\nSo, True: 1,6 (2 total), False: 2,3,4,5,7 (5 total)\n\nBut Statement 1 says \"At least 2 are true\" (OK), but Statement 2 is false (since 5 > 3), which is correct.\n\nBut now, only 2 statements are true, which means Statement 6 is true (T = 2 is prime), but Statement 7 is false (F = 5 is not composite). Statement 3 and 4 are both false, so Statement 5 is false.\n\nBut Statement 3 says \"Exactly 5 are true\" (False, correct), Statement 4 says \"Exactly 2 are false\" (False, correct).\n\nBut the issue is with Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is false (which matches).\n\nSo, is this a valid solution?\n\nBut Statement 2: \"At most 3 are false\" -- but there are 5 false, so Statement 2 is false. That matches.\n\nSo, is this a possible solution? Let's check if all the conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut Statement 7: \"F is composite\" -- F = 5 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\nTrue: 1,6 \u2192 2\nFalse: 2,3,4,5,7 \u2192 5\n\nBut then Statement 1: \"At least 2 are true\" -- TRUE\n\nStatement 2: \"At most 3 are false\" -- FALSE\n\nStatement 3: \"Exactly 5 are true\" -- FALSE\n\nStatement 4: \"Exactly 2 are false\" -- FALSE\n\nStatement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 is true, but not both\" -- Both are false, so FALSE\n\nStatement 6: \"T is prime\" -- TRUE\n\nStatement 7: \"F is composite\" -- FALSE\n\nSo, the counts match, but let's check Statement 5 again: \"Either 3 or 4 is true, but not both\". Both are false, so Statement 5 is false, which is correct.\n\nBut let's check Statement 6: \"T is prime\" -- T = 2 is prime, so TRUE. Statement 7: \"F is composite\" -- F = 5 is not composite, so FALSE.\n\nSo, everything matches.\n\nBut now, let's try T = 3:\n\n- F = 4\n- Statement 1: T >= 2? TRUE\n- Statement 2: F <= 3? FALSE\n- Statement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n- Statement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n- Statement 6: T = 3 (prime)? TRUE\n- Statement 7: F = 4 (composite)? TRUE\n\nSo, TRUE: 1,6,7 \u2192 3\nFALSE: 2,3,4,5 \u2192 4\n\nBut now, Statement 1: At least 2 true -- TRUE\n\nStatement 2: At most 3 false -- FALSE (F = 4)\n\nStatement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n\nStatement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n\nStatement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n\nStatement 6: T = 3 is prime -- TRUE\n\nStatement 7: F = 4 is composite -- TRUE\n\nSo, is this valid?\n\nNow, let's try T = 4:\n\n- F = 3\n- Statement 1: T >= 2? TRUE\n- Statement 2: F <= 3? TRUE\n- Statement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n- Statement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n- Statement 6: T = 4 (not prime)? FALSE\n- Statement 7: F = 3 (not composite)? FALSE\n\nSo, TRUE: 1,2 \u2192 2\nFALSE: 3,4,5,6,7 \u2192 5\n\nBut then, Statement 6: T = 4, not prime, so FALSE.\n\nNow, let's try T = 6:\n\n- F = 1\n- Statement 1: T >= 2? TRUE\n- Statement 2: F <= 3? TRUE\n- Statement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n- Statement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so FALSE\n- Statement 6: T = 6 (not prime)? FALSE\n- Statement 7: F = 1 (not composite)? FALSE\n\nSo, TRUE: 1,2 \u2192 2\nFALSE: 3,4,5,6,7 \u2192 5\n\nSo, only T = 2, 3, 5 are possible for T being prime.\n\nBut for T = 3:\n\n- TRUE: 1,6,7\n- So T = 3, but then Statement 6: \"T is prime\" -- TRUE (T = 3 is prime)\n- Statement 7: F = 4 (composite), so TRUE\n- Statement 1: T >= 2? TRUE\n- Statement 2: F <= 3? FALSE (F = 4)\n- Statement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n- Statement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so FALSE\n\nSo, TRUE: 1,6,7 (3)\nFALSE: 2,3,4,5 (4)\n\nSo, T = 3, F = 4\n\nBut now, Statement 7: \"F is composite\" -- F = 4, which is composite, so TRUE.\n\nIs this a valid solution? Let's check that the counts match.\n\n- Number of true statements: 3\n- Number of false statements: 4\n\nDoes this create any contradictions? Let's check Statement 2: \"At most 3 are false\" -- but there are 4 false, so Statement 2 is FALSE, which matches.\n\nStatement 3: \"Exactly 5 are true\" -- FALSE\n\nStatement 4: \"Exactly 2 are false\" -- FALSE\n\nStatement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n\nStatement 6: T = 3 (prime) -- TRUE\n\nStatement 7: F = 4 (composite) -- TRUE\n\nSo, is this a possible solution? Let's check the self-consistency:\n\n- Statement 1: TRUE (T = 3 >= 2)\n- Statement 2: FALSE (F = 4 > 3)\n- Statement 3: FALSE (T \u2260 5)\n- Statement 4: FALSE (F \u2260 2)\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n- Statement 6: TRUE\n- Statement 7: TRUE\n\nSo, the truth assignments are consistent with the statements.\n\nSo, possible values for T: 2, 3, 5.\n\nBut for T = 2:\n\n- TRUE: 1,6\n- FALSE: 2,3,4,5,7\n\nDoes Statement 6: T is prime? Yes (2)\n\nStatement 7: F = 5 (not composite), so FALSE\n\nSo, is this a possible solution? Let's check Statement 2: F = 5 > 3, so Statement 2 is FALSE.\n\nAll the rest match.\n\nSo, yes, T = 2 is possible.\n\nNow, for T = 3, we already checked.\n\nFor T = 5, we already checked.\n\nSo, let's check for T = 7:\n\n- F = 0\n- Statement 1: TRUE (T = 7 >= 2)\n- Statement 2: TRUE (F = 0 <= 3)\n- Statement 3: FALSE (T \u2260 5)\n- Statement 4: FALSE (F \u2260 2)\n- Statement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n- Statement 6: T = 7 (prime) -- TRUE\n- Statement 7: F = 0 (not composite) -- FALSE\n\nSo, TRUE: 1,2,6 (3)\nFALSE: 3,4,5,7 (4)\n\nSo, T = 3 is also possible here.\n\nBut Statement 6: T = 7 is prime, so TRUE.\n\nStatement 7: F = 0 is not composite, so FALSE.\n\nSo, is this a possible solution? Let's see:\n\nTRUE: 1,2,6\n\nFALSE: 3,4,5,7\n\nBut now, number of true statements is 3, which matches Statement 6.\n\nBut Statement 2: F = 0 <= 3, so TRUE.\n\nStatement 1: T = 7 >= 2, so TRUE.\n\nStatement 3: T = 5? FALSE\n\nStatement 4: F = 2? FALSE\n\nStatement 5: Both 3 and 4 are false, so Statement 5 is FALSE\n\nStatement 6: TRUE\n\nStatement 7: FALSE\n\nSo, yes, this is possible.\n\nThus, the possible number of solutions is **4**:\n\n- T = 2\n- T = 3\n- T = 5\n- T = 7\n\nBut let's check T = 7:\n\n- TRUE: 1,2,6\n- FALSE: 3,4,5,7\n\nSo, number of true statements: 3, but T = 7, which is a contradiction.\n\nWait, but T = 7 means all statements are true.\n\nBut then Statement 3: \"Exactly 5 are true\" -- FALSE\n\nBut if all statements are true, then Statement 3 must be TRUE. Contradiction.\n\nSo, T cannot be 7.\n\nTherefore, the possible number of solutions is **3**.\n\n<answer>3</answer>",

That's 3. Let's check for consistency.\n\n- S2: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\" Always true.\n- S6: \"Number of true statements is a prime.\" There are 3 true statements, 3 is prime. True.\n- S7: \"Number of false statements is a composite number.\" There are 4 false statements, 4 is composite. True.\n\nThis is consistent.\n\nAre there other possible numbers of true statements?\n\nTry \\( T = 2 \\):\n\n- S1: 2 >= 6 \u2192 False\n- S2: 5 <= 7 \u2192 True\n- S3: 2 == 5 \u2192 False\n- S4: 5 == 2 \u2192 False\n- S5: Both S3 and S4 are false, so S5 is false.\n- S6: 2 is prime \u2192 True\n- S7: 5 is not composite \u2192 False\n\nSo S2 and S6 are true. That's 2, which matches.\n\nBut S7 would be false, which is okay since only S2 and S6 are true.\n\nBut let's check S6: \"Number of true statements is a prime number.\" There are 2 true statements, 2 is prime. Ok.\n\nS2: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\" Always true.\n\nSo, possible. Let's try \\( T = 2 \\).\n\nBut S6 says \"number of true statements is a prime\", so S6 would be true.\n\nS2 is always true.\n\nSo S2 and S6 are true, the rest are false.\n\nBut S7: \"Number of false statements is composite.\" There are 5 false statements, 5 is not composite. So S7 is false, which is consistent.\n\nSo \\( T = 2 \\) is possible.\n\nTry \\( T = 5 \\) again:\n\nPreviously, S3 and S4 would both be true, so S5 is false. We get S2, S3, S4, S6 true, that's 4, not 5.\n\nTry \\( T = 1 \\):\n\n- S1: 1 >= 6 \u2192 False\n- S2: 6 <= 7 \u2192 True\n- S3: 1 == 5 \u2192 False\n- S4: 6 == 2 \u2192 False\n- S5: Both S3 and S4 are false, so S5 is false.\n- S6: 1 is not prime \u2192 False\n- S7: 6 is composite \u2192 True\n\nSo S2 and S7 are true, that's 2, not 1.\n\nTry \\( T = 0 \\):\n\n- S1: 0 >= 6 \u2192 False\n- S2: 7 <= 7 \u2192 True\n- S3: 0 == 5 \u2192 False\n- S4: 7 == 2 \u2192 False\n- S5: Both S3 and S4 are false, so S5 is false.\n- S6: 0 is not prime \u2192 False\n- S7: 7 is not composite \u2192 False\n\nOnly S2 is true, which is not consistent with T = 0.\n\nTry \\( T = 4 \\):\n\nPreviously, only S2 was true.\n\nTry \\( T = 6 \\):\n\nPreviously, only S1 and S2 are true, which doesn't match.\n\nNow, let's check which values are possible:\n\nFrom above, \\( T = 3 \\) and \\( T = 2 \\) are possible.\n\nBut let's check the consistency with S6 and S7 for \\( T = 3 \\):\n\n- S6: 3 is prime \u2192 True\n- S7: 4 is composite \u2192 True\n\nSo S2, S6, S7 are true, rest are false.\n\nIs S5 correct? S3 and S4 are both false, so \"either...but not both\" is false, which matches.\n\nSo that's a valid solution.\n\nFor \\( T = 2 \\):\n\n- S2: True\n- S6: True\n- S7: 5 is not composite \u2192 S7 is false.\n\nSo only S2 and S6 are true, rest are false.\n\nIs S6 correct? 2 is prime, yes.\n\nIs S2 correct? Always true.\n\nIs S5 correct? Both S3 and S4 are false, so S5 is false.\n\nSo this is a valid solution.\n\nNow, is \\( T = 1 \\) possible? Above, S2 and S7 are true, so T = 2.\n\nTherefore, the possible numbers of solutions (ways to assign true/false to the statements) are for:\n\n- \\( T = 3 \\): S2, S6, S7 are true.\n- \\( T = 2 \\): S2, S6 are true.\n\nSo, **number of possible solutions** is 2.\n\n<answer>2</answer>",

So, this cannot be.\n\nSince S3 and S4 both claim \\( T = 4 \\), but S5 says not both can be true, let's see what happens if S3 is true and S4 is false.\n\nCase 1: S3 true, S4 false (\\( T = 4 \\), S4 false)\n\nBut S4: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \nBut if T = 4, then F = 3, so S4 should be true. Contradiction.\n\nCase 2: S3 false, S4 true (\\( T = 4 \\), S3 false)\n\nBut S3: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \nBut if T = 4, S3 should be true. Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, T cannot be 4.\n\nFrom S2, \\( T \\geq 4 \\).  \nTry \\( T = 5 \\):\n\n- S1: True (\\( T \\geq 2 \\))\n- S2: True (\\( 7 - T = 2 \\leq 3 \\))\n- S3: False (\\( T \\neq 4 \\))\n- S4: False (\\( 7 - T \\neq 3 \\))\n- S5: Both S3 and S4 are false, so S5 is false.\n- S6: Is 5 prime? Yes, S6: True\n- S7: \\( 7 - T = 2 \\), is 2 composite? No, it's prime. So S7: False\n\nTrue statements: S1, S2, S6. That's 3 true statements.\n\nBut S6 says the number of true statements is prime. 3 is prime, so S6 is true, so that's consistent.\n\nBut S2: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \nNumber of false statements: 7 - 3 = 4. Wait, but above we have 3 true, so 4 false, which would make S2 false, but we marked S2 as true. Contradiction.\n\nWait: Let's recount.\nWith T = 3, F = 4\nWith T = 5, F = 2\n\nWith T = 5, S1: true, S2: true (since 2 \u2264 3), S3: false, S4: false, S5: false, S6: true, S7: false.\n\nNumber of true statements: S1, S2, S6: 3.\n\nBut then S6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. 3 is prime, so S6 is true.  \nBut S2: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \nWith T = 3, F = 4, so S2 would be false.  \nWith T = 5, F = 2, so S2 would be true.\n\nSo, T = 5 is valid from S2.\n\nBut S5: \"Either S3 or S4 is true, but not both.\" Both are false, so S5 is false.  \nS7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\" F = 2, which is not composite, so S7 is false.\n\nSo, S1, S2, S6 are true. S3, S4, S5, S7 are false.\n\nNumber of true statements: 3.\n\nBut S2 says \"at most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" But that's true, since F = 2.\n\nIs there any contradiction? Let's check S3: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\" False.\n\nS4: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" False.\n\nS5: \"Either S3 or S4 is true, but not both.\" Both are false, so S5 is false.\n\nS6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\" 3 is prime. S6 is true.\n\nS7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\" F = 4, which is composite. Wait, but above with T = 3, F = 4.\n\nSo, in the T = 5 case, S7 is false because F = 2.\n\nBut in the T = 3 case, S1: true, S2: false (since F = 4), S3: false, S4: false, S5: false, S6: true (since 3 is prime), S7: true (since 4 is composite).\n\nSo, S1, S6, S7 are true; that's 3 true statements.\n\nBut S2 is false, since F = 4, which is not \u2264 3.\n\nSo, S6: true (number of true statements is 3, which is prime), S7: true (number of false statements is 4, composite).\n\nAre there any other possibilities?\n\nTry T = 6:\n\nS1: true, S2: true (F = 1), S3: false, S4: false, S5: false, S6: true (6 is not prime), S7: false (F = 1, which is not composite).\n\nWait, S6: is 6 prime? No. So S6: false.\n\nSo, S1, S2 are true. That's 2 true statements.\n\nS6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\" 2 is prime, so S6: true.\n\nWait, but S6 depends on itself being true.\n\nSo, if S6 is true, then number of true statements is prime. With S1, S2, S6: 3 true statements.\n\nBut then S6 is true. So, 3 true statements, S6 is true.\n\nGo back to T = 3:\n\nS1: true, S2: false, S3: false, S4: false, S5: false, S6: true, S7: true.\n\nTrue: S1, S6, S7: 3 true statements.\n\nIs this consistent? S6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\" 3 is prime, so S6 is true.\n\nS7: \"Number of false statements is composite.\" With T = 3, F = 4, which is composite. So S7 is true.\n\nS1: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\" True.\n\nSo, S1, S6, S7: true. Number of true statements: 3.\n\nS3: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\" False.\n\nS4: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" False.\n\nS5: \"Either S3 or S4 is true, but not both.\" Both are false, so S5 is false.\n\nS2: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" F = 4, so S2 is false.\n\nSo, is this consistent? Let's check for circularity.\n\nS6 is true if and only if the number of true statements is prime. Here, 3 is prime, so S6 is true.\n\nS7 is true if and only if F is composite. F = 4, which is composite, so S7 is true.\n\nSo, this solution is consistent.\n\nIs there another possible solution? Try T = 2:\n\nS1: true, S2: false (F = 5), S3: false, S4: false, S5: false, S6: true (2 is prime), S7: false (F = 5, not composite).\n\nSo, S1, S6: true. So, 2 true statements.\n\nIs S6: \"number of true statements is a prime number.\" 2 is prime, so S6: true.\n\nSo, S1, S6: true.\n\nIs this consistent? S2: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" F = 5, so S2 is false.\n\nS7: \"number of false statements is composite.\" F = 5, not composite, so S7 is false.\n\nSo, S1, S6: true. Number of true statements: 2.\n\nS6: \"number of true statements is a prime number.\" 2 is prime, so S6 is true.\n\nSo, this is consistent.\n\nIs S1: true? \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\" Yes.\n\nSo, S1, S6: true. Number of true statements: 2.\n\nIs S6: true? Yes.\n\nIs there a contradiction?\n\nTry T = 7:\n\nS1: true, S2: true (F = 0), S3: false, S4: false, S5: false, S6: false (7 is prime), S7: false (F = 0, not composite).\n\nWait, S6: \"number of true statements is a prime number.\" 7 is prime, so S6: true.\n\nSo, S1, S2, S6: true.\n\nBut S3: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\" False.\n\nS4: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" False.\n\nS5: \"Either S3 or S4 is true, but not both.\" Both are false, so S5: false.\n\nS7: \"number of false statements is composite.\" F = 0, not composite, so S7: false.\n\nSo, S1, S2, S6: true. Number of true statements: 3.\n\nBut S6: \"number of true statements is a prime number.\" 3 is prime, so S6: true.\n\nIs S2: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" F = 0, which is \u2264 3, so S2: true.\n\nS1: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\" Yes.\n\nSo, this is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, try T = 5:\n\nS1: true, S2: true (F = 2), S3: false, S4: false, S5: false, S6: true (5 is prime), S7: false (F = 2, not composite).\n\nSo, S1, S2, S6: true. Number of true statements: 3.\n\nS6: \"number of true statements is a prime number.\" 3 is prime, so S6: true.\n\nSo, this is consistent.\n\nSo, possible numbers of true statements: 2, 3.\n\nBut let's check if T = 3 is valid.\n\nFrom S2, \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" With T = 3, F = 4, so S2: false.\n\nSo, S1, S6, S7: true.\n\nSimilarly, T = 2: S1, S6: true.\n\nSo, in both cases, S6 is true, and the number of true statements is 2 or 3.\n\nTherefore, possible numbers of true statements: 2 or 3.\n\nBut is T = 3 and T = 2 both possible? Let's check:\n\nT = 2: S1, S6: true. Is S6: \"number of true statements is a prime number.\" 2 is prime.\n\nT = 3: S1, S6, S7: true. S6: \"number of true statements is a prime number.\" 3 is prime.\n\nSo, in both cases, no contradictions.\n\nTherefore, there are **two possible solutions**.\n\n<answer>2</answer>",

Contradiction.\n\n### Case 6: 4 statements are true (\\( n = 4 \\))\n- S1: False.\n- S2: At most 2 false? 3 false, so False.\n- S3: False.\n- S4: 3 false, so False.\n- S5: Both S3 and S4 are False, so S5 is False.\n- S6: 4 is not prime, so False.\n- S7: 3 false, 3 is not composite, so False.\n\nSo all are false, which cannot be.\n\n### Case 7: 1 statement is true (\\( n = 1 \\))\n- S1: At least 7 true? No, so False.\n- S2: At most 2 false? 6 false, so False.\n- S3: False.\n- S4: 6 false, not 5, so False.\n- S5: Both S3 and S4 are False, so S5 is False.\n- S6: 1 is not prime, so False.\n- S7: 6 false, 6 is composite, so True.\n\nSo only S7 is True, others False. Number of true statements is 1, which is not composite, so S7 would be False. Contradiction.\n\n### Case 8: 0 statements are true (\\( n = 0 \\))\n- All False, which is impossible.\n\n### Final Check: Is there any possible solution?\n\nNone of the cases above are consistent.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<answer>0</answer>",

Contradiction.\n\n**Case T = 6:**\n- S1: true (6 \u2265 3)\n- S2: F = 1, S2 says F \u2264 0 \u21d2 false.\n- S3: T = 4 \u21d2 false.\n- S4: F = 3 \u21d2 false.\n- S5: Both S3 and S4 are false \u21d2 S5 false.\n- S6: T = 6 (not prime) \u21d2 false.\n- S7: F = 1 (not composite) \u21d2 false.\n- Only S1 is true, so T \u2260 6.\n\n**Case T = 5:**\n- F = 2\n- S1: true\n- S2: F = 2, S2 is false.\n- S3: T \u2260 4 \u21d2 false.\n- S4: F \u2260 3 \u21d2 false.\n- S5: Both S3 and S4 false \u21d2 S5 false.\n- S6: T = 5 (prime) \u21d2 true.\n- S7: F = 2 (not composite) \u21d2 false.\n- Only S1 and S6 are true, T \u2260 5.\n\n**Case T = 4:**\n- F = 3\n- S1: true\n- S2: F = 3, S2 is false.\n- S3: T = 4 \u21d2 true.\n- S4: F = 3 \u21d2 true.\n- S5: S3 true, S4 true \u21d2 S5 false.\n- S6: T = 4 (not prime) \u21d2 false.\n- S7: F = 3 (not composite) \u21d2 false.\n- True statements: S1, S3, S4 (T=3). Contradicts T=4.\n\n**Case T = 3:**\n- F = 4\n- S1: true\n- S2: F = 4, S2 is false.\n- S3: T = 3 \u21d2 false.\n- S4: F = 3 \u21d2 false.\n- S5: Both S3 and S4 false \u21d2 S5 false.\n- S6: T = 3 (prime) \u21d2 true.\n- S7: F = 4 (composite) \u21d2 true.\n- True statements: S1, S6, S7 (T=3). This fits T=3.\n  - S1: At least 3 are true (yes, 3).\n  - S6: T=3, prime, true.\n  - S7: F=4, composite, true.\n\nCheck S5: Either S3 or S4 true, but not both. Both are false, so S5 is false, which matches.\n\nSo, T = 3 is possible.\n\n**Case T = 2:**\n- F = 5\n- S1: T=2, not \u2265 3 \u21d2 S1 false.\n- S6: T=2, prime \u21d2 true.\n- S7: F=5, not composite \u21d2 false.\n- Only S6 true, T \u2260 2.\n\n**Case T = 1 or 0:**\n- S1: T<3, so S1 false.\n- S6: T=1 or 0, not prime \u21d2 S6 false.\n- So not possible.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of possible T:**\n- T = 3 is possible.\n\nAre there multiple solutions? Let's check if the assignment of S1, S6, and S7 as true and the rest as false is unique.\n\nAssign:\n- S1: true\n- S6: true\n- S7: true\n- S2: false\n- S3: false\n- S4: false\n- S5: false\n\nCheck if this assignment is consistent with the statements:\n- S1: At least 3 true (yes, 3).\n- S2: F=4, S2 says F\u22640 (false), so S2 false as assigned.\n- S3: T=3, S3 says T=4 (false), so S3 false as assigned.\n- S4: F=4, S4 says F=3 (false), so S4 false as assigned.\n- S5: S3 false, S4 false, so S5 says \"either S3 or S4 is true, but not both\" (false), so S5 false as assigned.\n- S6: T=3, prime, so S6 true as assigned.\n- S7: F=4, composite, so S7 true as assigned.\n\nThis is a consistent solution.\n\nIs there another possible combination? Let's check if S1, S6, S7, and another statement could be true, but with T=4, S1, S3, S4, S6, S7. Let's try:\n\nIf S3 is true (T=4), then S4 must be false (otherwise S5 is false), but then S5 would be true (since exactly one of S3, S4 is true), but now T=4, so four true statements.\n\nBut then S1: true, S3: true, S5: true, S6: true (for T=4, S6 is false, since 4 is not prime). Contradicts.\n\nTherefore, the only possible number of solutions is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
