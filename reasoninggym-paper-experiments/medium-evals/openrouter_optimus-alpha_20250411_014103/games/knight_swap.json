board.\n- The knight's move is color-bound on a chessboard: a knight always alternates between light/dark squares.\n- On a 3x4 board, with A1 as dark, the coloring alternates.\n- Let's check the colors of starting and target positions.\n\nLet\u2019s assign colors:\n- A1: dark\n- B1: light\n- C1: dark\n- D1: light\n- A2: light\n- B2: dark\n- C2: light\n- D2: dark\n- A3: dark\n- B3: light\n-

to C3, A2, C1 (two dark, one light)\n\nBut notice: Black knights start on all light squares, but to swap, must move to two dark and one light square. White knights start on two dark, one light, and must move to all light squares.\n\nBut a knight always alternates square color when moving. So, a knight on a dark square can only reach a light square in one move, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, to swap, a knight on dark must move to light, and vice versa.\n\nBut the numbers do not match: there are 4 light and 2 dark squares among the 6 knight-occupied squares.\n\nThus, the coloring parity prevents a full swap.\n\nTherefore:\n\n<answer>No</answer>",

board.\n- The knight's move is color-bound on a chessboard: a knight always alternates between light/dark squares.\n- On a 3x4 board, with A1 as dark, the coloring alternates.\n- Let's check the colors of starting and target positions.\n\nLet\u2019s assign colors:\n- A1: dark\n- B1: light\n- C1: dark\n- D1: light\n- A2: light\n- B2: dark\n- C2: light\n- D2: dark\n- A3: dark\n- B3: light\n- C3: dark\n- D3: light\n\nWhite Knights:\n- C3: dark\n- A2: light\n- C1: dark\n\nBlack Knights:\n- D3: light\n- C2: light\n- B1: light\n\nTarget positions:\n- Whites to D3, C2, B1 (all light)\n- Blacks to C3, A2, C1 (two dark, one light)\n\nBut notice: Black knights start on all light squares, but to swap, must move to two dark and one light square. White knights start on two dark, one light, and must move to all light squares.\n\nBut a knight always alternates square color when moving. So, a knight on a dark square can only reach a light square in one move, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, to swap, a knight on dark must move to light, and vice versa.\n\nBut the numbers do not match: there are 4 light and 2 dark squares among the 6 knight-occupied squares.\n\nThus, the coloring parity prevents a full swap.\n\nTherefore:\n\n<answer>No</answer>",
