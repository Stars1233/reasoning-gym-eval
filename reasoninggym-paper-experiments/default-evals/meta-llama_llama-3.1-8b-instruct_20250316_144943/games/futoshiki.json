However, the first row has 3 > 5, so the third row must have 5 in the fourth column. Now, the third row has 4 in the first column, and since the third row has 5 in the fourth column, the first row must have 4 in the fourth column. However, the first row has 1 in the second column, so the first row has 4 in the fourth column, and 2 in the first column. Since the first row has 2 in the first column and 1 in the second column, the first row has 5 in the third column. However, the first row has 5 in the third column, and the first row has 3 > 5, so the first row has 5 in the first column is not possible, hence, the first row has 5 in the third column is not possible.
