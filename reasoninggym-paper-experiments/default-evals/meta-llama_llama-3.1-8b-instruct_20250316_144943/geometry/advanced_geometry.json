Let's use the first equation:\n\n4x - 7y = 26\n4(31) - 7y = 26\n124 - 7y = 26\n-7y = 26 - 124\n-7y = -98\ny = -98 / -7\ny = 14.000\n\nThe intersection point of the first two altitudes is (31.000, 14.000).\n\nNow, let's find the intersection point of the first and third altitudes.\n\ny + 6 = (4/7)(x + 4)\ny + 1 = (3/2)(x + 5)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve it using substitution or elimination method.\n\nLet's use the substitution method. Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate y:\n\n(y + 6) - (y + 1) = (4/7)(x + 4) - (3/2)(x + 5)\n5 = (8/14)(x + 4) - (21/14)(x + 5)\n5 = (8x + 32 - 21x - 105)/14\n5 = (-13x - 73)/14\n-13x - 73 = 70\n-13x = 143\nx = -11.000\n\nNow that we have the value of x, substitute it into one of the equations to find the value of y. Let's use the second equation:\n\ny + 1 = (3/2)(x + 5)\ny + 1 = (3/2)(-11 + 5)\ny + 1 = (3/2)(-6)\ny + 1 = -9\ny = -10\n\nThe intersection point of the first and third altitudes is (-11.000, -10.000).\n\nNow, let's find the intersection point of the second and third altitudes.\n\ny + 8 = (1/5)(x + 1)\ny + 1 = (3/2)(x + 5)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve it using substitution or elimination method.\n\nLet's use the substitution method. Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate y:\n\n(y + 8) - (y + 1) = (1/5)(x + 1) - (3/2)(x + 5)\n7 = (2/10)(x + 1) - (15/10)(x + 5)\n70 = 2(x + 1) - 15(x + 5)\n70 = -13x - 13\n13x = -57\nx = -4.385\n\nNow that we have the value of x, substitute it into one of the equations to find the value of y. Let's use the second equation:\n\ny + 1 = (3/2)(x + 5)\ny + 1 = (3/2)(-4.385 + 5)\ny + 1 = (3/2)(0.615)\ny + 1 = 0.9255\ny = -0.0745\n\nThe intersection point of the second and third altitudes is (-4.385, -0.0745).\n\nNow, we have the intersection points of the first two altitudes, the first and third altitudes, and the second and third altitudes. We can see that the first and third altitudes intersect at (-11.000, -10.000) and the second and third altitudes intersect at (-4.385, -0.0745).\n\nThe intersection point of the first and third altitudes and the second and third altitudes is the orthocenter of the triangle.\n\nThe orthocenter of the triangle is (-5.000, -3.000).",

The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of -1/2, which is 2.\n\nThe equation of the altitude from C is y - (-2) = (2)(x - (-1)). Simplifying, we get y + 2 = 2x + 2 or y = 2x.\n\nNow we can find the intersection point of the three altitudes. We can solve the system of equations:\n\ny = (1/3)x + 4\nx = -3\ny = 2x\n\nSubstituting x = -3 into the first equation, we get y = (1/3)(-3) + 4 = -1 + 4 = 3.\n\nSubstituting x = -3 into the third equation, we get y = 2(-3) = -6.\n\nSince the altitude from A and the altitude from C do not intersect at the same point as the altitude from B, we need to find the intersection point of the first and third altitudes.\n\nWe can solve the system of equations:\n\ny = (1/3)x + 4\ny = 2x\n\nSubstituting (1/3)x + 4 for y in the second equation, we get (1/3)x + 4 = 2x. Subtracting (1/3)x from both sides, we get 4 = (5/3)x. Multiplying both sides by 3/5, we get 12/5 = x.\n\nSubstituting x = 12/5 into the first equation, we get y = (1/3)(12/5) + 4 = 4/5 + 4 = (24/5 + 20/5) = 44/5.\n\nTherefore, the intersection point of the first and third altitudes is (12/5, 44/5).\n\nHowever, this is not the orthocenter of the triangle. The altitude from B is a vertical line and does not intersect with the first and third altitudes at the same point as the altitude from B. \n\nNow, we need to find the intersection point of the altitude from B and the first altitude.\n\nWe can substitute x = -3 into the first equation, y = (1/3)x + 4. We get y = (1/3)(-3) + 4 = -1 + 4 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the orthocenter of the triangle ABC is (-3, 3).",

The altitude from vertex C is the line perpendicular to line AB.\n   To find the slope of AB, we use the formula:\n   m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n   m = (-5 - 1) / (9 - 4)\n   m = -6 / 5\n   The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of -6/5, which is 5/6.\n   The equation of the altitude from C is y - (-3) = (5/6)(x - (-3)).\n\nNow we have the equations of the three altitudes:\n   y - 1 = 6(x - 4)\n   y + 5 = (-7/4)(x - 9)\n   y + 3 = (5/6)(x + 3)\n\nNow we need to find the intersection point of these lines. We can do this by solving the system of equations.\n   y - 1 = 6(x - 4)\n   y + 5 = (-7/4)(x - 9)\n   y + 3 = (5/6)(x + 3)\n\nWe can solve the first two equations to find the x-coordinate:\n   y - 1 = 6(x - 4)\n   y + 5 = (-7/4)(x - 9)\n   Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 1:\n   4(y - 1) = 4(6(x - 4))\n   y + 5 = (-7/4)(x - 9)\n   4y - 4 = 24x - 96\n   y + 5 = (-7/4)x + 21.75\n   Subtract the second equation from the first:\n   (4y - 4) - (y + 5) = (24x - 96) - (-7/4x + 21.75)\n   3y - 9 = (24x + 7/4x) - 96 + 21.75\n   3y - 9 = (96x + 7x)/4 - 74.25\n   3y - 9 = (103x/4) - 74.25\n   Multiply both sides by 4:\n   12y - 36 = 103x - 297\n   103x - 12y = 261\n   Now we need to find the x-coordinate. We can use the first and third equations:\n   y - 1 = 6(x - 4)\n   y + 3 = (5/6)(x + 3)\n   Multiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 6:\n   y - 1 = 6(x - 4)\n   6(y + 3) = 5(x + 3)\n   y - 1 = 6x - 24\n   6y + 18 = 5x + 15\n   Add the two equations:\n   (y - 1) + (6y + 18) = (6x - 24) + (5x + 15)\n   7y + 17 = 11x - 9\n   Subtract 17 from both sides:\n   7y = 11x - 26\n   Now we have two equations:\n   103x - 12y = 261\n   7y = 11x - 26\n   Multiply the second equation by 12 and the first equation by 1:\n   84y = 132x - 312\n   103x - 12y = 261\n   Subtract the second equation from the first:\n   (84y) - (-12y) = (132x) - (103x)\n   96y = 29x - 312\n   Divide both sides by 96:\n   y = (29/96)x - 3.25\n   Now we can substitute this value into the first equation:\n   y - 1 = 6(x - 4)\n   ((29/96)x - 3.25) - 1 = 6(x - 4)\n   (29/96)x - 4.25 = 6x - 24\n   Multiply both sides by 96:\n   29x - 408 = 576x - 2304\n   Subtract 29x from both sides:\n   -408 = 547x - 2304\n   Add 2304 to both sides:\n   1896 = 547x\n   Divide both sides by 547:\n   x = 1896/547\n   x = 3.467\n\nNow we can substitute this value into the equation for y:\n   y = (29/96)x - 3.25\n   y = (29/96)(3.467)\n   y = 1.083\n\nThe coordinates of the orthocenter are (3.467, 1.083).",

The equation is inconsistent, so there is no solution for this intersection.\n\n16. To find the intersection of h_a and h_c, we can use the equation of h_a and substitute the expression for y from the equation of h_c:\ny + 7 = 3x - 27\ny - 4 = (12/11)(x + 3)\ny = (12/11)(x + 3) + 4\nNow we substitute the expression for y into the equation of h_a:\n((12/11)(x + 3) + 4) + 7 = 3x - 27\n(12/11)(x + 3) + 11 = 3x - 27\n(12/11)(x + 3) = 3x - 38\n(12/11)(x + 3) - 3x = -38\n(12/11)x + 36/11 - 3x = -38\n(12/11)x - (33/11)x = -38 - 36/11\n(-21/11)x = -418/11\nx = -418/(-21)\nx = 20\n\n17. Now we substitute the x value into the equation of h_c to find the y value:\ny - 4 = (12/11)(20 + 3)\ny - 4 = (12/11)(23)\ny - 4 = 276/11\ny = (276/11) + 4\ny = 276/11 + 44/11\ny = 320/11\ny = 29.091\n\n18. The intersection of h_a and h_c is (20, 29.091).\n\n19. Now we have the intersection points of the altitudes: (8.381, -1.857) and (20, 29.091).\n\n20.
