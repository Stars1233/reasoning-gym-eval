We can apply the distributive property of conjunction over disjunction to get (Q \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)) \u2228 (P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)). \n\nFrom the definition of implication, P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So we can rewrite the previous expression as (Q \u2227 (\u00acP \u2228 Q)) \u2228 (P \u2227 (\u00acP \u2228 Q)).\n\nUsing the distributive property again, we get (Q \u2227 \u00acP) \u2228 (Q \u2227 Q) \u2228 (P \u2227 \u00acP) \u2228 (P \u2227 Q). \n\nSince Q \u2227 Q is equivalent to Q and P \u2227 \u00acP is equivalent to false, we can simplify the expression to (Q \u2227 \u00acP) \u2228 Q \u2228 (P \u2227 Q).\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that \u00ac(Q \u2228 P), which is equivalent to \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP. This means that Q \u2227 \u00acP is false. So we can simplify the previous expression to Q \u2228 (P \u2227 Q).\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that Q is true. So we can substitute Q for true in the previous expression to get Q \u2228 (P \u2227 Q). \n\nSince Q is true, Q \u2228 (P \u2227 Q) is equivalent to true \u2228 (P \u2227 Q). \n\nFrom the definition of disjunction, true \u2228 X is equivalent to true for any X. So we can simplify the expression to true.\n\nHowever, we can use another approach to get the answer. \n\nFrom statement 1, we have \u00acQ \u2228 \u00acP.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have \u00ac(Q \u2228 P), which is equivalent to \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP.\n\nFrom the definition of conjunction, \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP is equivalent to \u00ac(Q \u2228 P). \n\nSo we can conclude that \u00acQ \u2228 \u00acP is equivalent to \u00ac(Q \u2228 P). \n\nSince \u00acQ \u2228 \u00acP is true, \u00ac(Q \u2228 P) is also true.\n\nFrom the definition of negation, \u00ac(Q \u2228 P) is equivalent to \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP.\n\nSo we can conclude that \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP is true.\n\nFrom the definition of conjunction, \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP is equivalent to \u00acP (since \u00acQ is true if and only if Q is false, so we can remove it).\n\nSo we can conclude that \u00acP is true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \u00acP.",

          "full_model_response": "\u00acP\n\nTo get this answer, we can use the following steps:\n\nFrom statement 3, we have (Q \u2228 P) \u2227 (P \u2192 Q). We can apply the distributive property of conjunction over disjunction to get (Q \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)) \u2228 (P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)). \n\nFrom the definition of implication, P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So we can rewrite the previous expression as (Q \u2227 (\u00acP \u2228 Q)) \u2228 (P \u2227 (\u00acP \u2228 Q)).\n\nUsing the distributive property again, we get (Q \u2227 \u00acP) \u2228 (Q \u2227 Q) \u2228 (P \u2227 \u00acP) \u2228 (P \u2227 Q). \n\nSince Q \u2227 Q is equivalent to Q and P \u2227 \u00acP is equivalent to false, we can simplify the expression to (Q \u2227 \u00acP) \u2228 Q \u2228 (P \u2227 Q).\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that \u00ac(Q \u2228 P), which is equivalent to \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP. This means that Q \u2227 \u00acP is false. So we can simplify the previous expression to Q \u2228 (P \u2227 Q).\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that Q is true. So we can substitute Q for true in the previous expression to get Q \u2228 (P \u2227 Q). \n\nSince Q is true, Q \u2228 (P \u2227 Q) is equivalent to true \u2228 (P \u2227 Q). \n\nFrom the definition of disjunction, true \u2228 X is equivalent to true for any X. So we can simplify the expression to true.\n\nHowever, we can use another approach to get the answer. \n\nFrom statement 1, we have \u00acQ \u2228 \u00acP.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have \u00ac(Q \u2228 P), which is equivalent to \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP.\n\nFrom the definition of conjunction, \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP is equivalent to \u00ac(Q \u2228 P). \n\nSo we can conclude that \u00acQ \u2228 \u00acP is equivalent to \u00ac(Q \u2228 P). \n\nSince \u00acQ \u2228 \u00acP is true, \u00ac(Q \u2228 P) is also true.\n\nFrom the definition of negation, \u00ac(Q \u2228 P) is equivalent to \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP.\n\nSo we can conclude that \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP is true.\n\nFrom the definition of conjunction, \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP is equivalent to \u00acP (since \u00acQ is true if and only if Q is false, so we can remove it).\n\nSo we can conclude that \u00acP is true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \u00acP.",

Since Q is true, Q \u2228 P is also true. Now we have (P \u2192 Q) and we know Q is true. To check the truth of (P \u2192 Q), we can see that if Q is true, then (P \u2192 Q) is true regardless of P.\n\nNow we have two statements, (Q \u2228 P) and (P \u2192 Q), both of which are true. From these two, we can infer P by applying the rule of inference of hypothetical syllogism, which states that if (P \u2192 Q) and (Q \u2228 P) are true, then P is true.\n\nHowever, there's a contradiction in our premises 1 and 2, where 1 says (\u00acQ \u2228 \u00acP) and 2 says \u00ac(Q \u2228 P). Let's simplify premise 2, we have \u00acQ \u2227 \u00acP. \n\nNow we know from premise 4 that Q is true, so we can conclude that \u00acQ is false. Thus, \u00acP must be true, and we can conclude that P is false.",
