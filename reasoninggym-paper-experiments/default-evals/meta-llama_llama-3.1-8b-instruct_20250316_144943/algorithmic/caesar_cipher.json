Identify the type of cipher: This is a Caesar cipher, which shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.\n2. Determine the shift: Since the problem does not provide the shift, I will try common shifts (1-25) to find the correct one.\n3. Decrypt the message for each possible shift.\n\nLet's try a shift of 3, as it is a common shift for Caesar ciphers.\n\nD = L + 3 = O\nE = M + 3 = P\nF = N + 3 = Q\nG = O + 3 = R\nH = P + 3 = S\nI = Q + 3 = T\nJ = R + 3 = U\nK = S + 3 = W\nL = T + 3 = V\nM = U + 3 = X\nN = V + 3 = Y\nO = W + 3 = Z\nP = X + 3 = A\nQ = Y + 3 = B\nR = Z + 3 = C\nS = A + 3 = D\nT = B + 3 = E\nU = C + 3 = F\nV = D + 3 = G\nW = E + 3 = H\nX = F + 3 = I\nY = G + 3 = J\nZ = H + 3 = K\n\nNow, I will apply the shift to the given text:\n\nLRO ZLJJLK QEB FQ PBBJP QL PBOSBP SBOV TBII\nBEG KHKHKD CBA ABA KBAE KJ ABAKBA KDJ KJ\n\nThe decrypted text is:\n\nBEG KHKHKD CBA ABA KBAE KJ ABAKBA KDJ KJ",
