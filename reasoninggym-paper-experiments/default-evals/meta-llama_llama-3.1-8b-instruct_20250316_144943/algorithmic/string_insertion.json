There is no 'ABCD' or 'BCDE' in the string, but we find 'CDEA' in 'DACACCDCEDCDA'. So we insert 'C' after 'CDEA', resulting in 'EDDAEDCACACCCDCEDCDA'.\n3. We now have a 'C' at the end, and we continue the search from there. \n4. There is no 'ABCD', 'BCDE', 'CDEA' or 'DEAB' in 'EDDAEDCACACCCDCEDCDA', but we find 'EABC' in 'EDDAEDCACACCCDCEDCDA'. So we insert 'E' after 'EABC', resulting in 'EDDAEDCACACCCDCEDCDAEDC'.\n5. We now have a 'C' at the end, and we continue the search from there.\n6. There is no 'ABCD', 'BCDE', 'CDEA' or 'DEAB' in 'EDDAEDCACACCCDCEDCDAEDC', but we find 'DEAB' in 'DCEDCDAEDC'. So we insert 'D' after 'DEAB', resulting in 'EDDAEDCACACCCDCEDCDAEDCD'.\n7. We now have a 'D' at the end, and we continue the search from there.\n8. There is no 'ABCD', 'BCDE', 'CDEA' or 'EABC' in 'EDDAEDCACACCCDCEDCDAEDCD', but we find 'CDEA' in 'CACCCDCEDCDAEDC'. So we insert 'C' after 'CDEA', resulting in 'EDDAEDCACACCCDCEDCDAEDCC'.\n9. We now have a 'C' at the end, and we continue the search from there.\n10. There is no 'ABCD', 'BCDE', 'CDEA' or 'EABC' in 'EDDAEDCACACCCDCEDCDAEDCC', but we find 'BCDE' in 'DCEDCDAEDCC'. So we insert 'B' after 'BCDE', resulting in 'EDDAEDCACACCCDCEDCDAEDCB'.\n11.

Now, start from the beginning of the string and find the first occurrence of E, which is 'E'.\n7. Since the string is EBBDDDD, we insert 'A' after 'E', the new string is EABBD.\n8. Now, start from the beginning of the string and find the first occurrence of ABCD, which is not present.\n9. Since the string is EABBD, we find the first occurrence of BCDE, which is 'BB'. \n10. Since the string is EABBD, we insert 'B' after 'BB', the new string is EABBBD.\n11. Now, start from the beginning of the string and find the first occurrence of ABCD, which is not present.\n12. Since the string is EABBBD, we find the first occurrence of BCDE, which is 'BB'. \n13. Since the string is EABBBD, we insert 'B' after 'BB', the new string is EABBBBD.\n14. Now, start from the beginning of the string and find the first occurrence of ABCD, which is not present.\n15. Since the string is EABBBBD, we find the first occurrence of CDEA, which is not present.\n16. Since the string is EABBBBD, we find the first occurrence of DEAB, which is 'BBB'.\n17. Since the string is EABBBBD, we insert 'D' after 'BBB', the new string is EABBBBD.\n18. Since the string is EABBBBD, we find the first occurrence of ABCD, which is not present.\n19. Since the string is EABBBBD, we find the first occurrence of BCDE, which is 'BBB'.\n20. Since the string is EABBBBD, we insert 'B' after 'BBB', the new string is EABBBBBD.\n21. Since the string is EABBBBBD, we find the first occurrence of CDEA, which is 'BBBD'.\n22. Since the string is EABBBBBD, we insert 'C' after 'BBBD', the new string is EABBBBBCBD.\n23. Since the string is EABBBBBCBD, we find the first occurrence of ABCD, which is not present.\n24. Since the string is EABBBBBCBD, we find the first occurrence of BCDE, which is 'BBBBCB'.\n25. Since the string is EABBBBBCBD, we insert 'B' after 'BBBBCB', the new string is EABBBBBCBDB.\n26. Since the string is EABBBBBCBDB, we find the first occurrence of CDEA, which is not present.\n27. Since the string is EABBBBBCBDB, we find the first occurrence of DEAB, which is 'BBCB'.\n28. Since the string is EABBBBBCBDB, we insert 'D' after 'BBCB', the new string is EABBBBBCBDDB.\n29. Since the string is EABBBBBCBDDB, we find the first occurrence of ABCD, which is not present.\n30. Since the string is EABBBBBCBDDB, we find the first occurrence of BCDE, which is 'BBCBDDB'.\n31. Since the string is EABBBBBCBDDB, we insert 'B' after 'BBCBDDB', the new string is EABBBBBCBDBDB.\n\n<answer>EABBBBBCBDBDB</answer>",

Initialize an empty string to store the result.\n2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the current position in the string.\n3. Loop through the string, checking for the substrings in the given order.\n4. For each substring, check if it exists in the string from the current position to the end.\n5. If a substring is found, insert the corresponding character at the end of the substring and update the position to the end of the substring.\n6. Repeat the loop until the entire string has been processed.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above steps:\n\n```python\ndef insert_characters(s):\n    result = ''\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        if i + 4 <= len(s) and s[i:i+4] == 'ABCD':\n            result += s[:i] + s[i:i+4] + 'A' + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif i + 4 <= len(s) and s[i:i+5] == 'BCDE':\n            result += s[:i] + s[i:i+5] + 'B' + s[i+5:]\n            i += 6\n        elif i + 4 <= len(s) and s[i:i+4] == 'CDEA':\n            result += s[:i] + s[i:i+4] + 'C' + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif i + 4 <= len(s) and s[i:i+4] == 'DEAB':\n            result += s[:i] + s[i:i+4] + 'D' + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        elif i + 4 <= len(s) and s[i:i+4] == 'EABC':\n            result += s[:i] + s[i:i+4] + 'E' + s[i+4:]\n            i += 5\n        else:\n            result += s[i]\n            i += 1\n    return result\n\nprint(insert_characters('EBBDDDD'))\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\nEBBDEADABDEABDE",
