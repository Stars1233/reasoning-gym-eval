We'll count all the numbers between 94 and 9013 (inclusive), and then subtract the count of non-prime numbers in this range. However, since this method is not efficient for large ranges, we'll use a rough estimate: There are 9013 - 94 + 1 = 8920 numbers in this range. We'll estimate the number of non-prime numbers in this range by subtracting the count of prime numbers in the range 2 to 94 (which is 29) and the count of prime numbers in the range 83 to 9013 (which is 2), and then adding the count of prime numbers in the range 2 to 83 (which is 22).

We'll count the total number of prime numbers in the range 6899 to 9013 by adding the count of prime numbers in the range 83 to 9013 and the count of prime numbers in the range 2 to 83, and then subtracting the count of non-prime numbers in the range 94 to 9013.
