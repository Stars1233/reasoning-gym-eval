Start with 0 (red) and press B (add 2): 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n2. Press C (multiply 2, but since the light is red, it's effectively add 2): 2 + 2 = 4 (red)\n3. Press B (add 2): 4 + 2 = 6 (red)\n4. Press C (multiply 2, but since the light is red, it's effectively add 2): 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n5. Press C (multiply 2, but since the light is red, it's effectively add 2): 8 + 2 = 10 (red)\n6. Press C (multiply 2, but since the light is red, it's effectively add 2): 10 + 2 = 12 (red)\n7. Press C (multiply 2, but since the light is red, it's effectively add 2): 12 + 2 = 14 (red)\n8. Press C (multiply 2, but since the light is red, it's effectively add 2): 14 + 2 = 16 (red)\n9. Press C (multiply 2, but since the light is red, it's effectively add 2): 16 + 2 = 18 (red)\n10. Press C (multiply 2, but since the light is red, it's effectively add 2): 18 + 2 = 20 (red)\n11. Press C (multiply 2, but since the light is red, it's effectively add 2): 20 + 2 = 22 (red)\n12. Press C (multiply 2, but since the light is red, it's effectively add 2): 22 + 2 = 24 (red)\n\nAlternatively, a shorter sequence could be found by exploiting the fact that we can turn the light green by pressing a button. Since we need to multiply by 2, we can press C twice to turn the light green, then press B to add 2, and finally press C to multiply 2, resulting in 4. \n\nHowever, since we want to get to 24, we need to add 20 more. We can do this by turning the light green by pressing C twice and then pressing B four times to add 8, and then press C to multiply 2, resulting in 16. Then, press B twice to add 4, and finally press C to multiply 2, resulting in 24.\n\nA shorter sequence would be:\nC \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 B \u2192 B \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 B \u2192 C\n\nThis sequence is not the shortest. A shorter sequence can be found by using the fact that we can turn the light green by pressing a button and then use the fact that we need to add 2 four times and multiply by 2 four times to get to 24.\n\nA shorter sequence would be:\nC \u2192 C \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 B \u2192 B \u2192 B \u2192 C",

      "question": "In front of you are some buttons, a light, and a number. The light will toggle between red and green whenever you press a button. Each button performs a mathematical operation to the number, but the operation may depend on the state of the light.\nYou must press the shortest correct sequence of buttons to reach the target value. Your answer should be a sequence of buttons separated by '\u2192', for example: A \u2192 B \u2192 C\n\nStart: 0 (red)\nTarget: 10\nButtons:\nA: Multiply 2 (when red)\nB: Subtract 1 (when green)\nC: Add 1 (when any)",
