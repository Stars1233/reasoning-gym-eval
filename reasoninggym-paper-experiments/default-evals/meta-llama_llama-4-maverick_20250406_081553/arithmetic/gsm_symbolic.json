So, saute_rate = 45 / 12 = 3.75 carrots per minute.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the time it takes Mia to saute 180 carrots.\nTo find the time it takes to saute 180 carrots, we divide the total number of carrots by the rate at which she sautes them. So, time_to_saute = 180 / 3.75 = 48 minutes.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total time it takes Mia to peel and saute 180 carrots.\nThe total time is the sum of the time it takes to peel the carrots and the time it takes to saute them. So, total_time = time_to_peel + time_to_saute = 20 + 48 = 68 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>68</answer>",

Mia can peel 9 carrots a minute. So, the time taken to peel 180 carrots = 180 / 9 = 20 minutes.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the time it takes Mia to saute 180 carrots.\nFirst, we need to determine how many carrots Mia can saute per minute. We know she can saute 45 carrots in 12 minutes. So, the number of carrots she can saute per minute = 45 / 12 = 3.75 carrots per minute. To saute 180 carrots, it will take her 180 / 3.75 = 48 minutes.\n\n## Step 3: Add the time it takes to peel and saute 180 carrots to get the total time.\nThe total time taken = time to peel 180 carrots + time to saute 180 carrots = 20 + 48 = 68 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>68</answer>",

The medical center has 2400 rooms, and 1/3 of them are occupied. So, the number of occupied rooms is 2400 * (1/3) = 800.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the initial number of unoccupied rooms.\nTo find the number of unoccupied rooms, we subtract the number of occupied rooms from the total capacity. So, 2400 - 800 = 1600 rooms are unoccupied initially.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks.\nSince 55 patients are admitted each day, we need to calculate how many patients are admitted in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks have 3 * 7 = 21 days. The total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks is 55 * 21 = 1155.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks.\nAfter admitting 1155 patients, the number of occupied rooms will be 800 (initially occupied) + 1155 (new admissions) = 1955. Therefore, the number of unoccupied rooms will be 2400 - 1955 = 445.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>445</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of eggs hidden in the yard.\nFirst, we need to figure out how many eggs were hidden. Since Mia hid 8 dozen eggs, and 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the total number of eggs is 8 * 12 = 96.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Harper finds.\nHarper finds 9 eggs.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of eggs Emma finds.\nEmma finds 2 times as many eggs as Harper. So, Emma finds 2 * 9 = 18 eggs.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of eggs Sophia finds.\nSophia finds 4 less eggs than Emma. So, Sophia finds 18 - 4 = 14 eggs.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of eggs Oliver finds.\nOliver finds 0.5 as many eggs as Sophia. So, Oliver finds 0.5 * 14 = 7 eggs.\n\n## Step 6: Sum the total number of eggs found by the children.\nTo find the total number of eggs found, we add the eggs found by Harper, Emma, Sophia, and Oliver. So, 9 + 18 + 14 + 7 = 48 eggs.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of eggs still hidden in the yard.\nThe number of eggs still hidden is the total number of eggs minus the number of eggs found. So, 96 - 48 = 48.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>48</answer>",

However, we will proceed with the information given: the comet orbits the sun every 55 years.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the age of Michael's uncle when Michael saw the Comet for the second time.\nMichael's uncle saw the Comet when he was 24 years old. Michael saw the Comet a second time when he was 4 times the age his uncle was when he saw the Comet. So, Michael's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is 4 * 24 = 96 years.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the time elapsed between Michael's first and second sightings of the Comet.\nSince the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, the time between Michael's first and second sightings of the Comet is 55 years.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Michael's age when he first saw the Comet.\nTo find Michael's age when he first saw the Comet, we need to subtract the orbital period of the Comet (55 years) from his age when he saw it for the second time (96 years). So, Michael's age when he first saw the Comet = 96 - 55 = 41 years.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>41</answer>",
