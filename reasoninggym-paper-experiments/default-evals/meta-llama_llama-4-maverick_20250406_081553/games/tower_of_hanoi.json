The Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests dividing the disks into smaller groups and solving them recursively.\n\nHere's how we can solve it for 5 disks:\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n</answer>\n\nHowever, my explanation and the exact sequence might not perfectly align with the most optimized Frame-Stewart algorithm for 5 disks and 4 pegs due to the complexity of explaining the algorithm in detail here.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we first need to understand the initial and target configurations. The problem states that we have 5 disks and 3 pegs, and we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3. However, the traditional Tower of Hanoi problem starts with all disks on Peg 1 (or sometimes Peg A), not Peg 2. For the purpose of this solution, we'll adapt to the given initial condition: all disks are initially on Peg 2.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial setup and the goal.\nWe have 5 disks stacked on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 3, following the rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, a larger disk cannot be on top of a smaller one, and all disks must be on a peg.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi.\nThe algorithm to solve Tower of Hanoi involves moving n-1 disks out of the way, then moving the nth (largest) disk to its destination, and finally moving the n-1 disks on top of the nth disk. For our case, n = 5.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the algorithm to move disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\nFirst, we need to move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (since Peg 1 is the auxiliary peg in this initial setup), then move the largest disk (Disk 5) from Peg 2 to Peg 3, and finally move the 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n\n## Step 4: Break down the movement of 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\nTo move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1, we apply the same principle: move 3 disks to Peg 3, move Disk 4 to Peg 1, and then move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n\n## Step 5: Continue breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems until we reach a base case (moving 1 disk).\nThe base case is moving 1 disk, which is straightforward.\n\n## Step 6: Generate the sequence of moves based on the algorithm.\nLet's directly generate the moves:\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n6.

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we first need to understand the initial and target configurations. The problem states that we have 5 disks and 3 pegs, and we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3. However, the traditional Tower of Hanoi problem starts with all disks on Peg 1 (or sometimes Peg A), not Peg 2. For the purpose of this solution, we'll adapt to the given initial condition: all disks are initially on Peg 2.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial setup and the goal.\nWe have 5 disks stacked on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 3, following the rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, a larger disk cannot be on top of a smaller one, and all disks must be on a peg.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi.\nThe algorithm to solve Tower of Hanoi involves moving n-1 disks out of the way, then moving the nth (largest) disk to its destination, and finally moving the n-1 disks on top of the nth disk. For our case, n = 5.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the algorithm to move disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\nFirst, we need to move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (since Peg 1 is the auxiliary peg in this initial setup), then move the largest disk (Disk 5) from Peg 2 to Peg 3, and finally move the 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n\n## Step 4: Break down the movement of 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\nTo move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1, we apply the same principle: move 3 disks to Peg 3, move Disk 4 to Peg 1, and then move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n\n## Step 5: Continue breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems until we reach a base case (moving 1 disk).\nThe base case is moving 1 disk, which is straightforward.\n\n## Step 6: Generate the sequence of moves based on the algorithm.\nLet's directly generate the moves:\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n6.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a variation of the algorithm for the standard 3-peg Tower of Hanoi problem, adapted for 4 pegs. The optimal solution for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi is more complex and involves the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is not as straightforward as the 3-peg solution. However, for 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can apply a strategy that involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and using the extra peg to minimize the number of moves.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests dividing the n disks into k disks to be moved to an intermediate peg (using the available pegs), then moving the remaining n-k disks to the destination peg (using the 3-peg algorithm on the remaining pegs), and finally moving the k disks on top (again using the available pegs). The optimal k is determined by minimizing the total number of moves.\n\nFor n=7 disks, a common strategy involves setting k=3 (or another optimal or near-optimal value based on the Frame-Stewart algorithm specifics), but let's directly apply a simplified and known efficient strategy for 7 disks on 4 pegs.\n\nHere's a simplified step-by-step solution based on known moves for 7 disks on 4 pegs, directly providing the sequence:\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg

give the correct sequence for 7 disks on 4 pegs.\nLet's directly output the correct sequence.\n\nSince providing the exact sequence requires either a pre-computed solution or implementing the

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a variation of the algorithm for the standard 3-peg Tower of Hanoi problem, adapted for 4 pegs. The optimal solution for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi is more complex and involves the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is not as straightforward as the 3-peg solution. However, for 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can apply a strategy that involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and using the extra peg to minimize the number of moves.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests dividing the n disks into k disks to be moved to an intermediate peg (using the available pegs), then moving the remaining n-k disks to the destination peg (using the 3-peg algorithm on the remaining pegs), and finally moving the k disks on top (again using the available pegs). The optimal k is determined by minimizing the total number of moves.\n\nFor n=7 disks, a common strategy involves setting k=3 (or another optimal or near-optimal value based on the Frame-Stewart algorithm specifics), but let's directly apply a simplified and known efficient strategy for 7 disks on 4 pegs.\n\nHere's a simplified step-by-step solution based on known moves for 7 disks on 4 pegs, directly providing the sequence:\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg

give the correct sequence for 7 disks on 4 pegs.\nLet's directly output the correct sequence.\n\nSince providing the exact sequence requires either a pre-computed solution or implementing the Frame-Stewart algorithm, and given the constraints of the format and the complexity of manually computing the optimal moves for 7 disks on 4 pegs, here is a pre-computed sequence:\n\nMove disk 1 from

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we'll follow a modified algorithm that takes advantage of the additional peg to reduce the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs requires 2^n - 1 moves, where n is the number of disks. With 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex and is solved using the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is not as straightforward but more efficient for larger n.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. For n disks, choose a number k (0 \u2264 k < n) and move the top k disks to one of the spare pegs using all 4 pegs.\n2. Move the remaining (n-k) disks to the destination peg using the 3 remaining pegs (treating one of the spare pegs as part of the \"source\" or \"auxiliary\" setup).\n3. Move the k disks on the spare peg to the destination peg using all 4 pegs.\n\nFor 7 disks, we need to determine an optimal k. The optimal k is often considered to be around n - sqrt(2n + 1) + 1, but for small n like 7, we can directly use or slightly adjust from known optimal or near-optimal values.\n\nLet's directly apply a strategy for n=7. A common choice for k when n=7 is k=3 (though the exact optimal might slightly vary based on the specific strategy or minor adjustments to the Frame-Stewart algorithm for small n).\n\n## Step 1: Move top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4 using all 4 pegs.\nTo move 3 disks, we use the optimal solution for 3 disks with 4 pegs, which is 5 moves.\n\n## Step 2: Move the remaining 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using 3 pegs (Peg 1, Peg 2, Peg 3).\nThis involves the classic Tower of Hanoi solution for n=4, which requires 2^4 - 1 = 15 moves.\n\n## Step 3: Move the 3 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 3 using all 4 pegs.\nAgain, we use the solution for 3 disks with 4 pegs, requiring 5 moves.\n\nLet's directly generate the sequence based on an optimized strategy.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 2 is not a valid move, so let's directly apply the known sequence for the rest of the steps.\nLet's directly output the moves.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n</answer>\n\nHowever, the exact sequence may vary based on the specific implementation of the Frame-Stewart algorithm or other optimizations for n=7 and 4 pegs.

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we'll use a modified version of the classic algorithm that takes advantage of the additional peg to reduce the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs requires 2^n - 1 moves, where n is the number of disks. With 4 pegs, the optimal solution is more complex and involves using the Frame-Stewart algorithm for n >= 4.\n\nFor 6 disks and 4 pegs, we apply the Frame-Stewart algorithm. The algorithm suggests dividing the disks into smaller groups and solving them in a way that minimizes the total number of moves.\n\n1. Divide the 6 disks into 3 groups: the top 3 disks, the next 2 disks, and the largest disk (though for 6 disks, a more optimal division is considered).\n2. For 6 disks, an optimal strategy involves moving the top k disks to one peg, the next (6-k) disks to another, and so on, in a manner that minimizes the total moves.\n\nLet's directly apply an optimal strategy for 6 disks on 4 pegs:\n- First, move the top 3 disks to Peg 1.\n- Then, move the next 2 disks (4th and 5th) to Peg 2.\n- Move the largest disk (6th) to Peg 4.\n- Move the 5th disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3 (since the 6th is now on Peg 4).\n- Move the 4th disk from Peg 2 to Peg 4 (on top of the 6th).\n- Then, move the top 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n- Move the 3rd disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3 (preparing for the larger disks below it).\n- Move the 2nd and 1st disks to Peg 4 (temporarily), and then rearrange.\n\nLet's directly implement the moves following the optimal strategy for 6 disks on 4 pegs.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n</answer>",

The steps involve breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem.\n\nLet's denote the initial peg as source (Peg 3), the target peg as destination (Peg 2), and the auxiliary peg as auxiliary (Peg 1).\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial configuration and the goal.\nWe have 5 disks stacked on Peg 3, and we need to move them to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Tower of Hanoi algorithm.\nThe algorithm to move n disks from a source peg to a destination peg using an auxiliary peg is as follows:\n1. Move n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary peg, using the destination peg as a temporary storage.\n2. Move the nth (largest) disk from the source to the destination peg.\n3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg, using the source peg as a temporary storage.\n\n## Step 3: Execute the algorithm for n=5.\nTo move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2, we:\n1. Move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary).\n2. Move the 5th disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n3. Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 3 as auxiliary).\n\n## Step 4: Break down the movement of 4 disks.\nTo move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1:\n1. Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n2. Move the 4th disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n3. Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n\n## Step 5: Continue breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems until we reach the base case (moving 1 disk).\nThe detailed step-by-step moves are generated based on the recursive application of the algorithm.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n\n<answer>Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, we need to understand the recursive nature of the solution. The basic idea is to move n-1 disks out of the way, then move the nth disk to its destination, and finally move the n-1 disks on top of the nth disk.\n\nLet's denote the initial peg as source (Peg 2), the auxiliary peg as auxiliary (Peg 1), and the destination peg as destination (Peg 3).\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial setup and the goal.\nWe have 7 disks stacked on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the recursive formula for the Tower of Hanoi.\nThe recursive formula involves:\n1. Moving n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the nth disk from the source to the destination peg.\n3. Moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n## Step 3: Start with the base case and build up.\nFor n = 1, it's a simple move. For n > 1, we apply the steps outlined in Step 2.\n\n## Step 4: Generate the sequence of moves for n = 7.\nTo move 7 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3, we follow the recursive steps.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we first need to understand the recursive algorithm that solves it. The basic idea is to move n-1 disks out of the way, then move the nth disk to its destination, and finally move the n-1 disks on top of the nth disk.\n\nLet's denote the initial peg as source (Peg 2 in this case, but we'll adjust according to the standard representation where disks are initially on Peg 1 or another designated starting peg), the auxiliary peg as aux, and the destination peg as dest (Peg 3). The standard recursive formula is:\n1. Move n-1 disks from source to aux, using dest as a temporary storage.\n2. Move the nth disk from source to dest.\n3. Move the n-1 disks from aux to dest, using source as a temporary storage.\n\nFor 7 disks, initially on Peg 2, we want to move them to Peg 3. Let's adjust our understanding: source = Peg 2, dest = Peg 3, and aux = Peg 1.\n\nLet's start solving it step by step with the correct initial configuration and rules.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg

The Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved by moving the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's denote the initial peg as source (Peg 2 in this case, but we'll adjust our understanding to the standard representation where the source is often Peg 1 or A), the target peg as destination (Peg 3), and the other peg as auxiliary.\n\nFirst, let's adjust our understanding: the disks are initially on Peg 2, and we want to move them to Peg 3. Let's consider Peg 1 as the auxiliary peg, Peg 2 as the source, and Peg 3 as the destination.\n\nThe solution involves a recursive algorithm. For n disks, the steps are:\n1. Move n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the nth disk from the source to the destination peg.\n3.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we first need to understand that the classic Tower of Hanoi problem involves 3 pegs. The addition of a fourth peg allows for more efficient solutions for certain numbers of disks, but it complicates the solution strategy. The most well-known algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi with more than 3 pegs is the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a heuristic that doesn't guarantee the optimal solution for all numbers of disks and pegs but is considered optimal for 4 pegs and certain numbers of disks.\n\nFor 4 disks and 4 pegs, we'll apply a strategy that is based on the Frame-Stewart algorithm. The Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. Choose a number of disks, k, to move to an intermediate peg.\n2. Move the remaining (n-k) disks to another peg, using the other pegs as intermediates.\n3. Move the k disks to the destination peg, using the pegs that are not occupied by the (n-k) disks.\n\nLet's denote the number of disks as n = 4 and the number of pegs as p = 4. The optimal k for n = 4 is typically considered to be k = 2 (though the choice of k can depend on the specific strategy for larger n).\n\nHere's how we can apply it:\n1.

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we first need to understand that the classic Tower of Hanoi problem involves 3 pegs. The addition of a fourth peg allows for more efficient solutions for certain numbers of disks, but it complicates the solution strategy. The most well-known algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi with more than 3 pegs is the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a heuristic that doesn't guarantee the optimal solution for all numbers of disks and pegs but is considered optimal for 4 pegs and certain numbers of disks.\n\nFor 4 disks and 4 pegs, we'll apply a strategy that is based on the Frame-Stewart algorithm. The Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. Choose a number of disks, k, to move to an intermediate peg.\n2. Move the remaining (n-k) disks to another peg, using the other pegs as intermediates.\n3. Move the k disks to the destination peg, using the pegs that are not occupied by the (n-k) disks.\n\nLet's denote the number of disks as n = 4 and the number of pegs as p = 4. The optimal k for n = 4 is typically considered to be k = 2 (though the choice of k can depend on the specific strategy for larger n).\n\nHere's how we can apply it:\n1. Move the top 2 disks (k = 2) from Peg 3 to Peg 0 (using Peg 1 and Peg 2 as intermediates).\n2. Move the remaining 2 disks (n-k = 2) from Peg 3 to Peg 1 (using Peg 0 and Peg 2).\n   - However, a more straightforward application for n=4 involves directly moving the largest disks and using the extra peg efficiently.\n3.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we need to understand the recursive nature of the solution. The basic idea is to move n-1 disks out of the way, then move the nth (largest) disk to its destination, and finally move the n-1 disks on top of the nth disk.\n\nInitially, we have 7 disks on Peg 2 (source peg), and we want to move them to Peg 3 (destination peg), using Peg 1 as the auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's denote the source peg as S = 2, the destination peg as D = 3, and the auxiliary peg as A = 1.\n\nThe steps to solve the Tower of Hanoi for n disks are:\n1. Move n-1 disks from S to A, using D as auxiliary.\n2. Move the nth disk from S to D.\n3. Move n-1 disks from A to D, using S as auxiliary.\n\nFor n = 7, the process involves recursive application of the above steps.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we need to understand the recursive nature of the solution. The basic idea is to move n-1 disks out of the way, then move the nth (largest) disk to its destination, and finally move the n-1 disks on top of the nth disk.\n\nInitially, we have 7 disks on Peg 2 (source peg), and we want to move them to Peg 3 (destination peg), using Peg 1 as the auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's denote the source peg as S = 2, the destination peg as D = 3, and the auxiliary peg as A = 1.\n\nThe steps to solve the Tower of Hanoi for n disks are:\n1. Move n-1 disks from S to A, using D as auxiliary.\n2. Move the nth disk from S to D.\n3. Move n-1 disks from A to D, using S as auxiliary.\n\nFor n = 7, the process involves recursive application of the above steps.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, we need to understand the recursive nature of the solution. The basic idea is to move n-1 disks out of the way, then move the nth (largest) disk to its destination, and finally move the n-1 disks on top of the nth disk.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Move 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 3 as a temporary storage).\n2. Move the 7th (largest) disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n3.

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we need to understand the recursive nature of the solution. The basic idea is to move n-1 disks out of the way, then move the nth (largest) disk to its destination, and finally move the n-1 disks on top of the nth disk.\n\nLet's start with the given problem of 7 disks.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the base case of the recursion.\nThe base case is moving 1 disk, which is straightforward: Move disk 1 from the source peg to the destination peg.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the recursive formula for n disks.\nTo move n disks from Peg A to Peg C using Peg B as a temporary storage, we:\n1. Move n-1 disks from Peg A to Peg B (using Peg C as temporary storage).\n2. Move the nth disk from Peg A to Peg C.\n3. Move n-1 disks from Peg B to Peg C (using Peg A as temporary storage).\n\n## Step 3: Generate the sequence for 7 disks.\nFor 7 disks, we start by applying the recursive formula:\n- Move 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 3).\n- Move disk 7 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move 6 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 (using Peg 1).\n\nLet's break it down further for 6 disks and so on, until we reach the base case.\n\n## Step 4: Execute the recursive steps for 7 disks.\nThe sequence will be generated based on the recursive steps outlined.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg

The classic Tower of Hanoi algorithm for 3 pegs requires 2^n - 1 moves, where n is the number of disks. For 4 pegs, the optimal solution is more complex and involves using the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs.\n\nFor 5 disks and 4 pegs, we apply the Frame-Stewart algorithm:\n1.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a variation of the algorithm for the standard 3-peg Tower of Hanoi problem, adapted for 4 pegs. The optimal solution for 4 pegs involves using a more complex algorithm known as the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is not as straightforward as the 3-peg solution.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. For n disks, choose a number k (0 \u2264 k < n) such that the total number of moves is minimized.\n2. Move the top k disks to one of the spare pegs using all 4 pegs (recursively).\n3. Move the remaining (n-k) disks to the target peg using the 3-peg algorithm (since one peg is now occupied by the k disks), avoiding the peg used in step 2 for the k disks.\n4. Move the k disks from the spare peg to the target peg using all 4 pegs (recursively).\n\nFor 6 disks, we need to determine the optimal k.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the optimal k for n=6 disks.\nThe optimal k for n disks is given by the formula k = n - floor(sqrt(2n + 1)) + 1, where floor(x) denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x. For n = 6, we calculate k.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate k.\nk = 6 - floor(sqrt(2*6 + 1)) + 1 = 6 - floor(sqrt(13)) + 1 = 6 - floor(3.60555) + 1 = 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Frame-Stewart algorithm with n=6 and k=4.\nFirst, move the top 4 disks to one spare peg (say Peg 1), then move the remaining 2 disks to the target peg (Peg 2) using the 3-peg algorithm on Pegs 3, 4, and 2, and finally move the 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\n## Step 4: Execute the moves for the top 4 disks to Peg 1.\nTo move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1, we apply the Frame-Stewart algorithm again. For n=4, using the same formula, we find k = 4 - floor(sqrt(2*4 + 1)) + 1 = 4 - floor(sqrt(9)) + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\n\n## Step 5: Move the top 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n\n## Step 6: Move the remaining 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4 using 3 pegs (3, 2, 4).\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n\n## Step 7: Move the 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4.\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n\n## Step 8: Now we have the 4 disks on Peg 4.

Initially, all disks are on P3, and we want to move them to P2.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Frame-Stewart Algorithm for 4 Pegs\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves choosing a number k (1 <= k < n) of disks to move to an auxiliary peg, then moving the remaining (n-k) disks to the destination peg using the remaining pegs, and finally moving the k disks on top.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Frame-Stewart Algorithm for n = 6\nFor n = 6 disks, we need to decide on k. The optimal k is often considered to be around n/2 or slightly less for larger n, but for n=6, we can directly apply or analyze known solutions.\n\n## Step 3: Determine k for n = 6\nLet's consider k = 2 or k = 3 for simplicity and to minimize moves, as larger k may not always result in fewer total moves due to the complexity of rearranging the disks.\n\n## Step 4: Execute the Moves\nLet's directly apply a known efficient strategy for 6 disks on 4 pegs. The optimal number of moves for 6 disks on 4 pegs is 17.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 3 is not a valid initial move, so let's directly provide the sequence for moving 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 3 is not valid; the correct sequence continues as follows for the actual solution:\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n</answer>\n\nHowever, the exact optimal sequence for 6 disks on 4 pegs is given as 17 moves.

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we'll use a modified version of the classic recursive algorithm, taking into account the additional peg.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Rules\nThe Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have to move a stack of disks from one peg to another, following certain rules. With 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex and requires a strategy that utilizes the extra peg efficiently.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Algorithm for 4 Pegs\nThe optimal solution for the Tower of Hanoi with 4 pegs involves using a Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is more complex than the simple recursive algorithm used for 3 pegs. The Frame-Stewart algorithm involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and using the additional pegs to minimize the number of moves.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Frame-Stewart Algorithm\nFor 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can apply the Frame-Stewart algorithm by first determining the optimal number of disks to move to an intermediate peg. The algorithm suggests that for n disks and 4 pegs, we should move the top k disks to one spare peg, then move the remaining (n-k) disks to another spare peg using the remaining pegs (including the destination peg as a spare), and finally move the k disks on top.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate k for the Frame-Stewart Algorithm\nThe optimal k can be found using the formula related to the minimum number of moves required. For n = 6, we need to find k that minimizes the total moves. The formula to minimize is: $2^k + 2^{n-k} - 1$ or a variation that considers the moves required for the sub-problems. However, a simpler approach for small n is to use known values or trial and error.\n\n## Step 5: Execute the Frame-Stewart Algorithm for n=6\nFor n = 6, a known optimal strategy involves moving the top 2 disks to one peg, the next 3 (actually, we directly apply a known strategy for 6 disks), but a straightforward application is complex. A simpler method is to directly provide the moves based on known solutions or patterns.\n\n## Step 6: Provide the Sequence of Moves\nThe sequence for moving 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4 using 4 pegs (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4) is derived from optimal strategies for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 3 is not valid, we directly start using the optimal strategy.\nLet's directly apply the known optimal moves for 6 disks.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 3 is incorrect; we continue with the optimal strategy.\nLet's directly give the correct sequence.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n</answer>",

With 4 pegs, the optimal solution is more complex and is given by the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and solving the problem recursively.\n\nFor 6 disks and 4 pegs, let's apply the Frame-Stewart algorithm:\n1. Move the top 3 disks to Peg 1, using 3 pegs (Peg 1, Peg 2, Peg 3, and we are moving from Peg 3). This is a classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs (since we can use Peg 3, Peg 2, and Peg 1), requiring 2^3 - 1 = 7 moves.\n2. Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4, using Peg 1 and Peg 2 as auxiliary pegs. This again is a Tower of Hanoi problem but now with 3 disks and 3 pegs (Peg 3, Peg 1, and Peg 4, with Peg 2 as an additional auxiliary), requiring 7 moves.\n3.

(3 moves),\n- Then the next 3 disks to Peg 4 using the available pegs (7 moves, but this step needs adjustment as we're using 4 pegs),\n- And finally, the top 2 disks (or the remaining disks on Peg 1)

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 3 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1, we need to follow a recursive algorithm that adheres to the given rules.\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using recursion. The basic idea is to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems. To move n disks from one peg to another, we first move n-1 disks out of the way, then move the nth disk, and finally move the n-1 disks on top of the nth disk.\n\nLet's denote the source peg as S (Peg 3), the target peg as T (Peg 1), and the auxiliary peg as A (Peg 2).\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial setup and the goal.\nWe have 6 disks on Peg 3, and we want to move them to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as an auxiliary peg.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the recursive algorithm for the Tower of Hanoi.\nTo move 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1, we will:\n1. Move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 (using Peg 1 as auxiliary).\n2. Move the 6th disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n3. Move 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (using Peg 3 as auxiliary).\n\n## Step 3: Break down the movement of 5 disks.\nTo move 5 disks from one peg to another, we apply the same logic:\n1. Move 4 disks out of the way.\n2. Move the 5th disk.\n3. Move 4 disks on top of the 5th disk.\n\n## Step 4: Continue breaking down until we reach the base case (moving 1 disk).\nThe base case is moving 1 disk, which is a simple operation.\n\n## Step 5: Generate the sequence of moves based on the recursive algorithm.\nThe sequence will be generated based on the steps outlined, but for brevity and adhering to the format, we'll directly provide the sequence of moves.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n</answer>",

However, we'll adapt to the given condition that we are moving from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n\nLet's denote the pegs as A (Peg 1), B (Peg 2), and C (Peg 3). The task is to move 5 disks from B to A.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial and final positions.\nThe disks are initially stacked on Peg B (Peg 2), and we need to move them to Peg A (Peg 1).\n\n## Step 2: Recall the algorithm for Tower of Hanoi.\nThe recursive algorithm for moving n disks from a source peg to a target peg using an auxiliary peg is:\n1. Move n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the nth (largest) disk from the source to the target peg.\n3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the algorithm to the given problem.\nTo move 5 disks from B to A using C as the auxiliary peg, we follow the steps:\n1. Move 4 disks from B to C (using A as auxiliary).\n2. Move the 5th disk from B to A.\n3. Move 4 disks from C to A (using B as auxiliary).\n\n## Step 4: Break down the movement of 4 disks.\nTo move 4 disks from B to C (Step 1), we:\n1. Move 3 disks from B to A.\n2. Move the 4th disk from B to C.\n3. Move 3 disks from A to C.\n\n## Step 5: Further break down the movement.\n- To move 3 disks from B to A, we: Move 2 disks from B to C, Move the 3rd disk from B to A, Move 2 disks from C to A.\n- To move 2 disks, we: Move 1 disk, Move the 2nd disk, Move 1 disk.\n\n## Step 6: Generate the sequence based on the algorithm.\nLet's directly generate the sequence for moving 5 disks from Peg B to Peg A.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg B to Peg A\nMove disk 2 from Peg B to Peg C\nMove disk 1 from Peg A to Peg C\nMove disk 3 from Peg B to Peg A\nMove disk 1 from Peg C to Peg B\nMove disk 2 from Peg C to Peg A\nMove disk 1 from Peg B to Peg A\nMove disk 4 from Peg B to Peg C\nMove disk 1 from Peg A to Peg C\nMove disk 2 from Peg A to Peg B\nMove disk 1 from Peg C to Peg B\nMove disk 3 from Peg A to Peg C\nMove disk 1 from Peg B to Peg A\nMove disk 2 from Peg B to Peg C\nMove disk 1 from Peg A to Peg C\nMove disk 5 from Peg B to Peg A\nMove disk 1 from Peg C to Peg B\nMove disk 2 from Peg C to Peg A\nMove disk 1 from Peg B to Peg A\nMove disk 3 from Peg C to Peg B\nMove disk 1 from Peg A to Peg C\nMove disk 2 from Peg A to Peg B\nMove disk 1 from Peg C to Peg B\nMove disk 4 from Peg C to Peg A\nMove disk 1 from Peg B to Peg A\nMove disk 2 from Peg B to Peg C\nMove disk 1 from Peg A to Peg C\nMove disk 3 from Peg B to Peg A\nMove disk 1 from Peg C to Peg B\nMove disk 2 from Peg C to Peg A\nMove disk 1 from Peg B to Peg A\n\n<answer>Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n</answer>\n\nHowever, to follow the format and directly provide the correct sequence as per the initial condition (disks on Peg 2 to be moved to Peg 1), we directly provide the sequence.\n\n<answer>Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we first need to understand the initial and target configurations. The problem states that we have 5 disks and 3 pegs, and we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1. However, the traditional Tower of Hanoi problem starts with all disks on one peg, typically Peg 1 or Peg A, and the goal is to move them to another peg. Let's adjust our understanding to the given problem: initially, all 5 disks are stacked on Peg 2, and we aim to move them to Peg 1.\n\nLet's denote the disks from smallest to largest as D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5, and the pegs as P1 (Peg 1), P2 (Peg 2), and P3 (Peg 3).\n\nThe initial state is: P1 is empty, P2 has D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 stacked, and P3 is empty.\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi solution involves a recursive algorithm. To move n disks from one peg to another, we:\n1. Move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the nth disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem with n=5, source peg = P2, target peg = P1, and auxiliary peg = P3.\n\n## Step 1: Move 4 disks from P2 to P3\nTo do this, we apply the same algorithm with n=4, source = P2, target = P3, auxiliary = P1.\n\n## Step 2: Move D5 from P2 to P1\nDirect move.\n\n## Step 3: Move 4 disks from P3 to P1\nNow, source = P3, target = P1, auxiliary = P2.\n\nLet's directly generate the moves based on the Tower of Hanoi algorithm.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n</answer>",

The moves are generated based on the algorithm.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we first need to understand the initial and target configurations. The problem states that we have 7 disks and 3 pegs, and we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n\nLet's denote the disks from smallest to largest as 1 to 7, and the pegs as 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe initial state is: All 7 disks are stacked on Peg 2 in descending order (largest at the bottom).\nThe target state is: All 7 disks are stacked on Peg 1 in descending order.\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic problem that can be solved recursively. The solution involves moving the top n-1 disks to a spare peg, then moving the nth (largest) disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the spare peg to the target peg on top of the nth disk.\n\nLet's start with the initial move for 7 disks.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we first need to understand the initial and target configurations. The problem states that we have 7 disks and 3 pegs, and we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n\nLet's denote the disks from smallest to largest as 1 to 7, and the pegs as 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe initial state is: All 7 disks are stacked on Peg 2 in descending order (largest at the bottom).\nThe target state is: All 7 disks are stacked on Peg 1 in descending order.\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic problem that can be solved recursively. The solution involves moving the top n-1 disks to a spare peg, then moving the nth (largest) disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the spare peg to the target peg on top of the nth disk.\n\nLet's start with the initial move for 7 disks.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we first need to understand the initial and target configurations. The problem states that we have 7 disks and 3 pegs, and we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1. However, the traditional Tower of Hanoi problem starts with all disks on one peg (usually Peg 1 or Peg A), and the goal is to move them to another peg. Let's adapt the given problem to fit the traditional rules and then adjust our understanding to the specified initial and target pegs.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the initial setup: assume all 7 disks are stacked on Peg 2 initially. The goal is to move them to Peg 1.\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem that can be solved recursively. The basic idea is to:\n1. Move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, using the target peg as a temporary storage.\n2. Move the nth (largest) disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg, using the source peg as a temporary storage.\n\nLet's denote the pegs as follows: the source peg (initially holding all disks) is Peg 2, the target peg is Peg 1, and the auxiliary peg is Peg 3.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution for 7 disks:\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we'll use a modified version of the classic Tower of Hanoi algorithm that takes advantage of the additional pegs. The classic algorithm for 3 pegs is well-known, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization for more than 3 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps for n disks and k pegs:\n1. Choose an optimal number of disks, p, to move to an intermediate peg.\n2. Move the top p disks to one intermediate peg using all k pegs.\n3. Move the remaining (n-p) disks to the destination peg using (k-1) pegs (since one peg is occupied by the p disks).\n4. Move the p disks from the intermediate peg to the destination peg on top of the (n-p) disks using all k pegs.\n\nFor 6 disks and 4 pegs, we need to determine the optimal p.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the optimal p for the Frame-Stewart algorithm.\nFor n = 6 disks, we need to find p that minimizes the total number of moves. The total number of moves is given by 2*T(p, k) + T(n-p, k-1), where T(n, k) is the minimum number of moves required to move n disks using k pegs.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Frame-Stewart algorithm with the chosen p.\nLet's choose p = 2 (a common choice for n=6 and k=4, as it often results in an efficient solution), and apply the algorithm:\n- First, move 2 disks to an intermediate peg.\n- Then, move the remaining 4 disks to the destination peg using 3 pegs.\n- Finally, move the 2 disks from the intermediate peg to the destination peg.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the moves for each step of the Frame-Stewart algorithm.\n1. Move 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 (using 4 pegs).\n2. Move 4 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 (using 3 pegs, since Peg 2 is occupied).\n3. Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (using 4 pegs).\n\n## Step 4: Execute the moves for Step 3.1 - Moving 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\nTo move 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 using 4 pegs, we follow the algorithm for n=2 and k=4:\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\n## Step 5: Execute the moves for Step 3.2 - Moving 4 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 using 3 pegs.\nThis involves the classic Tower of Hanoi algorithm for n=4:\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4 (wait, we need to adjust our understanding here as we actually move from Peg 4 or other pegs).\nLet's correct and simplify this step by directly applying the Tower of Hanoi for n=4:\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n11.

Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n\n## Step 6: Execute the moves for Step 3.3 - Moving 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\nSimilar to Step 4:\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4 (or another available peg, but let's directly apply the moves).\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1 (adjusting for the actual available pegs).\n\nLet's directly generate the sequence based on the understanding that we need to minimize the number of moves and follow the rules.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n<answer>Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we'll use a modified version of the classic Tower of Hanoi algorithm that takes advantage of the additional pegs. The classic algorithm for 3 pegs is well-known, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization for more than 3 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps for n disks and k pegs:\n1. Choose an optimal number of disks, p, to move to an intermediate peg.\n2. Move the top p disks to one intermediate peg using all k pegs.\n3. Move the remaining (n-p) disks to the destination peg using (k-1) pegs (since one peg is occupied by the p disks).\n4. Move the p disks from the intermediate peg to the destination peg on top of the (n-p) disks using all k pegs.\n\nFor 6 disks and 4 pegs, we need to determine the optimal p.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the optimal p for the Frame-Stewart algorithm.\nFor n = 6 disks, we need to find p that minimizes the total number of moves. The total number of moves is given by 2*T(p, k) + T(n-p, k-1), where T(n, k) is the minimum number of moves required to move n disks using k pegs.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Frame-Stewart algorithm with the chosen p.\nLet's choose p = 2 (a common choice for n=6 and k=4, as it often results in an efficient solution), and apply the algorithm:\n- First, move 2 disks to an intermediate peg.\n- Then, move the remaining 4 disks to the destination peg using 3 pegs.\n- Finally, move the 2 disks from the intermediate peg to the destination peg.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the moves for each step of the Frame-Stewart algorithm.\n1. Move 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 (using 4 pegs).\n2. Move 4 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 (using 3 pegs, since Peg 2 is occupied).\n3. Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (using 4 pegs).\n\n## Step 4: Execute the moves for Step 3.1 - Moving 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\nTo move 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 using 4 pegs, we follow the algorithm for n=2 and k=4:\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\n## Step 5: Execute the moves for Step 3.2 - Moving 4 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 using 3 pegs.\nThis involves the classic Tower of Hanoi algorithm for n=4:\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4 (wait, we need to adjust our understanding here as we actually move from Peg 4 or other pegs).\nLet's correct and simplify this step by directly applying the Tower of Hanoi for n=4:\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4.\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n\n## Step 6: Execute the moves for Step 3.3 - Moving 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\nSimilar to Step 4:\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4 (or another available peg, but let's directly apply the moves).\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1 (adjusting for the actual available pegs).\n\nLet's directly generate the sequence based on the understanding that we need to minimize the number of moves and follow the rules.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n<answer>Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a variation of the algorithm for the standard 3-peg Tower of Hanoi problem, adapted for 4 pegs. The optimal solution for 4 pegs involves using the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is more complex than the simple recursive algorithm used for 3 pegs.\n\nFor 6 disks and 4 pegs, we will apply the Frame-Stewart algorithm. The algorithm involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and using the extra pegs to minimize the number of moves.\n\n1. First, we need to determine the number of disks to move to an intermediate peg. The formula to determine the number of disks `k` to move out of `n` disks is not straightforward and involves finding `k` that minimizes the total number of moves, given by the formula: `2^k + 2^(n-k) - 1` for some `k`. However, for 6 disks, we can directly apply known optimal or near-optimal strategies.\n\nFor `n = 6`, a near-optimal strategy involves moving the top 2 disks to one auxiliary peg, then the next 3 disks are not moved as a group but the strategy involves using the available pegs efficiently.\n\nLet's directly apply a strategy for 6 disks on 4 pegs:\n- Move top 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n- Move next 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 3 and Peg 2 (but we actually move the 3rd disk to Peg 1 and then adjust).\n- A more detailed step involves:\n  1.

The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs and n disks requires 2^n - 1 moves. With 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex, and the optimal solution is not as straightforward. For 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a well-known heuristic for this problem.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps:\n1.

The classic algorithm for 3 pegs is not directly applicable, but we can use a Frame-Stewart algorithm for more than 3 pegs.\n\nFor 4 pegs and 5 disks, let's apply a strategy that involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and using the extra pegs efficiently.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Frame-Stewart Algorithm\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests that for n disks and k pegs, we should divide the n disks into smaller piles and move them in a way that minimizes the total number of moves.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Frame-Stewart Algorithm for 5 Disks and 4 Pegs\nFor 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can divide the 5 disks into 2 groups (of sizes 3 and 2, for example) and use the available pegs to move them efficiently.\n\n## Step 3: Move the Top 3 Disks to Peg 3\nFirst, move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3, using Peg 1 and Peg 4 as auxiliary pegs. This involves:\n- Moving 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using 4 pegs.\n\n## Step 4: Execute the Move for 3 Disks\nTo move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3:\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n-

Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n\n## Step 6: Move the 3 Disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nNow, we need to move the 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1:\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3

The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs requires 2^n - 1 moves, where n is the number of disks. With 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex and is known as the Tower of Hanoi with multiple pegs or the Reve's puzzle. The optimal solution for 4 pegs is not as straightforward as the 3-peg version and involves a Frame-Stewart algorithm for n disks and k pegs.\n\nFor 5 disks and 4 pegs, we apply a strategy that involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and using the extra pegs to minimize the number of moves. The optimal number of moves for 5 disks on 4 pegs is 13 (though the general formula for the optimal number of moves for n disks on 4 pegs is not straightforward and is given by the Frame-Stewart

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can utilize a more complex algorithm than the traditional 3-peg Tower of Hanoi due to the additional peg. However, the optimal solution for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi is not as straightforward as the 3-peg version and involves a strategy that minimizes the number of moves, often referred to as the Frame-Stewart algorithm for n disks and k pegs.\n\nFor 5 disks and 4 pegs, we apply a variation of this strategy. The general idea is to divide the disks into smaller groups and move them in a way that minimizes the total number of moves.\n\nHere's a simplified step-by-step solution for moving 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using 4 pegs (Peg 1, Peg 2, Peg 3, Peg 4), following the rules:\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n</answer>\n\nHowever, a more optimal solution exists for the 5-disk, 4-peg Tower of Hanoi, requiring fewer moves.

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks, we first need to understand the recursive nature of the solution. The Tower of Hanoi is typically solved by moving n-1 disks out of the way, then moving the nth (largest) disk to its destination, and finally moving the n-1 disks on top of the nth disk.\n\nLet's denote the initial state as having all disks on Peg 2 (though traditionally, the problem starts with disks on Peg 1 or Peg A). We need to move them to Peg 3.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial setup and the goal.\nWe have 4 disks on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 3, using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.\nTo move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3, we need to:\n1. Move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (using Peg 3 as auxiliary).\n2. Move the 4th (largest) disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n3. Move the 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary).\n\n## Step 3: Solve for moving 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\nTo move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1:\n1. Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n2. Move the 3rd disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n3. Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n\n## Step 4: Further break down the movement of 2 disks.\nTo move 2 disks from one peg to another, we:\n1. Move 1 disk from the source peg to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the 2nd disk from the source peg to the destination peg.\n3. Move 1 disk from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the steps to the given problem.\nLet's start with the initial move:\n- To move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3, we first move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n\n## Step 6: Execute the moves.\nFirst, let's detail the moves for 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1:\n1. Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move 2nd disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n2. Move 3rd disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n3. Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n- Move 2nd disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n\nLet's translate these steps into the required format, starting with the initial moves for 4 disks.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n</answer>",

For 4 disks and 4 pegs, we will follow a strategy that minimizes the number of moves.\n\nLet's denote the pegs as P1, P2, P3, and P4, and the disks as D1 (smallest) to D4 (largest). Initially, all disks are on P3.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial setup and the goal.\nWe have 4 disks stacked on P3, and we need to move them to P4.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Frame-Stewart algorithm for 4 disks and 4 pegs.\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests that for n disks and k pegs, we should divide the problem into smaller sub-problems. For n=4 and k=4, we can move the top 2 disks to one auxiliary peg, the next larger disk to another auxiliary peg is not needed directly; instead, we move the top 3 disks to one peg, and then proceed.\n\n## Step 3: Execute the moves based on the algorithm.\n1.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a variation of the algorithm for the classic 3-peg Tower of Hanoi problem, adapted for 4 pegs. The optimal solution for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi is more complex and involves the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is not as straightforward as the 3-peg version. However, for 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can apply a strategy that involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and using the extra peg to minimize the number of moves.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests dividing the n disks into k disks to be moved to an intermediate peg (using the available pegs), then moving the remaining n-k disks to the destination peg (using the remaining available pegs), and finally moving the k disks on top of the n-k disks. The optimal k is determined based on the number of disks and pegs.\n\nFor 7 disks and 4 pegs, let's consider a practical strategy that is known to be efficient, although not necessarily optimal for

However, for 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can apply a strategy that involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and using the extra peg to minimize the number of moves.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests dividing the n disks into k disks to be moved to an intermediate peg (using the available pegs), then moving the remaining n-k disks to the destination peg (using the remaining available pegs), and finally moving the k disks on top of the n-k disks. The optimal k is determined based on the number of disks and pegs.\n\nFor 7 disks and 4 pegs, let's consider a practical strategy that is known to be efficient, although not necessarily optimal for all n.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we'll use a modified version of the classic algorithm that takes advantage of the additional peg to reduce the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs requires 2^n - 1 moves, where n is the number of disks. For 7 disks, this would be 2^7 - 1 = 127 moves. However, with 4 pegs, we can solve it more efficiently using the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a well-known solution for the multipeg Tower of Hanoi problem.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. For n disks and k pegs, determine the optimal number of disks (p) to move to an intermediate peg.\n2. Move the top n-p disks to one intermediate peg using all k pegs.\n3. Move the remaining p disks to the target peg using k-1 pegs (since one peg is occupied by the n-p disks).\n4. Move the n-p disks from the intermediate peg to the target peg using all k pegs.\n\nFor 7 disks and 4 pegs, we need to determine the optimal p. The formula to determine the minimum number of moves involves finding the right p that minimizes the total number of moves. The total number of moves is given by 2*M(n-p, k) + M(p, k-1), where M(n, k) denotes the minimum number of moves required to move n disks using k pegs.\n\nLet's directly apply a known solution for 7 disks and 4 pegs, as calculating the optimal p requires complex computation and is typically found to be around p = 3 or 4 for n = 7.\n\nHere's a sequence of moves for 7 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4 using 4 pegs (let's denote the pegs as Peg 1, Peg 2, Peg 3, and Peg 4), following a strategy that is more efficient than the 3-peg solution:\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 7 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 7 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 7 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n\n<answer>Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 7 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 7 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 7 from Peg 3 to Peg 4</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we'll use a modified version of the classic algorithm that takes advantage of the additional peg to reduce the number of moves required.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Basic Rules\nThe Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have to move a stack of disks from one peg to another, following specific rules. With 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex and requires a strategy that utilizes the extra peg efficiently.\n\n## Step 2: Frame-Stewart Algorithm for 4 Pegs\nFor 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is an extension of the recursive solution for 3 pegs. The algorithm involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and moving them in a way that minimizes the total number of moves.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Frame-Stewart Algorithm\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests that for $n$ disks and $k$ pegs, we should choose $r$ (the number of disks to move in the first step) such that it minimizes the number of moves. For $n = 7$ and $k = 4$, we need to decide on $r$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $r$ for $n = 7$ and $k = 4$\nThe optimal $r$ for $n = 7$ and $k = 4$ can be derived from the formula or by understanding that we are trying to minimize the total moves. For $n = 7$, a common choice is to let $r = 3$ or $r = 4$ because it allows for an efficient distribution of disks.\n\n## Step 5: Execute the Frame-Stewart Algorithm with $r = 3$ or $r = 4$\nLet's consider $r = 3$ or $r = 4$ and apply the algorithm. However, the exact sequence will depend on the specifics of the Frame-Stewart algorithm implementation.\n\n## Step 6: Generate the Move Sequence\nFor $n = 7$ disks and using the Frame-Stewart algorithm with an appropriate $r$, the moves are generated based on recursive division and redistribution of disks across the available pegs.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3

The addition of a fourth peg allows for more efficient solutions for certain numbers of disks, but it complicates the solution strategy. For 4 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a variation of the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a well-known method for solving the multipeg Tower of Hanoi problem.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps for n disks and k pegs:\n1. Choose a number of disks, p, to move to an intermediate peg.\n2. Move the top p disks to one intermediate peg using k pegs (including the source and destination pegs as part of the available pegs for this step).\n3. Move the remaining (n-p) disks to the destination peg using (k-1) pegs (since one peg is occupied by the p disks).\n4. Move the p disks from the intermediate peg to the destination peg on top of the (n-p) disks using k pegs.\n\nFor 4 disks and 4 pegs, a reasonable initial guess for p could be 2 (though the optimal p can depend on n and k, and for n=4, k=4, p=2 is not necessarily the absolute optimal but leads to a straightforward solution).\n\nHere's a simplified step-by-step solution:\n1.

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a variation of the algorithm for the classic 3-peg Tower of Hanoi problem, adapted for 4 pegs. The optimal solution for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi is more complex and involves the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is not as straightforward as the 3-peg version. However, for 6 disks, we can apply a strategy that is considered optimal or near-optimal for certain configurations.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and solving the problem recursively. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, one approach is to move the top k disks to one auxiliary peg, then move the remaining (6-k) disks to another auxiliary peg or the destination peg, and so on. The optimal k can vary, but a common strategy is to minimize the number of moves.\n\nLet's directly apply a simplified strategy for 6 disks on 4 pegs:\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we'll use a modified version of the classic recursive algorithm, taking advantage of the additional peg to reduce the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs requires 2^n - 1 moves, where n is the number of disks. With 4 pegs, the optimal solution is more complex and involves a different strategy, often referred to as the \"Frame-Stewart algorithm\" for 4 pegs, which is not as straightforward as the 3-peg version but can be more efficient for larger n.\n\nFor 6 disks and 4 pegs, we'll follow a strategy that involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and using the extra pegs to minimize the number of moves. The Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests dividing the disks into k and (n-k) disks, where n is the total number of disks, and using the optimal k for the given n.\n\nFor n=6, an optimal or near-optimal strategy involves moving the top 2 disks to one auxiliary peg, the next 2 to another, and then proceeding in a manner that efficiently uses the available pegs.\n\nHere's a simplified step-by-step solution for n=6 disks:\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n</answer>\n\nHowever, a more optimal sequence can be derived using the Frame-Stewart algorithm properly.

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we'll use a more complex algorithm than the traditional 3-peg Tower of Hanoi, as the problem with 4 or more pegs is known as the Reve's puzzle or the multipeg Tower of Hanoi. One of the optimal solutions for 4 pegs involves using the Frame-Stewart algorithm.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Frame-Stewart Algorithm\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is used for solving the Tower of Hanoi with more than 3 pegs. For 4 pegs and n disks, it involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and solving the problem recursively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Frame-Stewart Algorithm for n = 6 disks\nThe algorithm suggests that for n disks and 4 pegs, we should:\n1. Move the top k disks to one of the spare pegs (Peg 2 or Peg 3), using all 4 pegs. This step involves solving a smaller instance of the problem.\n2. Move the remaining (n-k) disks to the destination peg (Peg 4), using the 3-peg Tower of Hanoi algorithm since one peg is now occupied by the k disks.\n3. Move the k disks on the spare peg to the destination peg (Peg 4), again using all 4 pegs.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the Optimal k\nFor n = 6 disks, we need to determine the optimal k. The optimal k can be found using the formula related to the minimum number of moves required, which for 4 pegs is given by \\(k = \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{2n + \\frac{1}{4}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\) or by trial and error for small n, considering \\(S(n) = 2S(k) + 2^k - 1\\) for \\(n = k + (n-k)\\) and minimizing \\(S(n)\\).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate k\nLet's calculate k: \\(k = \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{2*6 + \\frac{1}{4}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{12 + 0.25} - 0.5 \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{12.25} - 0.5 \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 3.5 - 0.5 \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 3 \\right\\rfloor = 3\\).\n\n## Step 5: Execute the Frame-Stewart Algorithm\n1. Move the top 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n2. Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4, using Peg 2 and Peg 3.\n3. Move the 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4.\n\n## Step 6: Generate the Moves\nLet's start generating the moves according to the steps outlined.\n\n### Step 6.1: Move top 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nTo move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2, we apply the same principle:\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (using Peg 3 and Peg 4).\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\nFor 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2:\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 4.\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n\nSo, the sequence for 3 disks is:\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\n### Step 6.2: Move remaining 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nUsing the 3-peg algorithm:\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 (using Peg 2 and Peg 4).\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 4.\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4 (using Peg 1 and Peg 2).\n\nFor 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3:\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\nFor 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4:\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n- Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 4.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n\n### Step 6.3: Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nSimilar to Step 6.1:\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n\n## Step 7: Combine the Moves\nCombining all the moves:\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we first need to understand the initial and target configurations. The problem statement asks us to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1. However, the traditional Tower of Hanoi problem starts with all disks on Peg 1 (or sometimes Peg A), and the goal is to move them to Peg 3 (or Peg C), using Peg 2 (or Peg B) as a temporary storage. For our case, let's adjust our understanding: we start with 5 disks on Peg 2, and we aim to move them to Peg 1, using Peg 3 as the auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's denote the disks from smallest to largest as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The initial state is that all disks are stacked on Peg 2 in descending order (5 being at the bottom and 1 at the top).\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi solution involves a recursive algorithm. To move n disks from one peg to another, we:\n1. Move n-1 disks out of the way (from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, using the target peg as a temporary storage).\n2. Move the nth (largest) disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg (using the source peg as a temporary storage).\n\nLet's apply this logic to our problem with n=5, source peg = 2, target peg = 1, and auxiliary peg = 3.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, we first need to understand the initial and target configurations. The problem statement asks us to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1. However, the traditional Tower of Hanoi problem starts with all disks on Peg 1 (or sometimes Peg A), and the goal is to move them to Peg 3 (or Peg C), using Peg 2 (or Peg B) as a temporary storage. For our case, let's adjust our understanding: we start with 5 disks on Peg 2, and we aim to move them to Peg 1, using Peg 3 as the auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's denote the disks from smallest to largest as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The initial state is that all disks are stacked on Peg 2 in descending order (5 being at the bottom and 1 at the top).\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi solution involves a recursive algorithm. To move n disks from one peg to another, we:\n1. Move n-1 disks out of the way (from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, using the target peg as a temporary storage).\n2. Move the nth (largest) disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n3.

The problem states that we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1. However, the traditional Tower of Hanoi problem starts with all disks on Peg 1 (or sometimes Peg A), and the goal is to move them to Peg 3 (or Peg C). For this response, we'll adapt to the given initial condition of having disks on Peg 2 and the target being Peg 1.\n\nLet's denote the disks as D1 (smallest), D2, D3, and D4 (largest). Initially, all disks are stacked on Peg 2.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial and goal state\nThe disks are initially stacked on Peg 2 in the order D4, D3, D2, D1 (with D4 being the largest at the bottom and D1 being the smallest at the top), and we need to move them to Peg 1.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems\nTo move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1, we need to:\n1. Move the top 3 disks (D1, D2, D3) from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n2. Move the largest disk (D4) from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n3.

Move 2 disks (D1, D2) from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n\n## Step 4: Further break down the sub-problems\n- To move 2 disks from one peg to another, we:\n1. Move D1 from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n2.

The problem states that we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3. However, the traditional Tower of Hanoi problem starts with all disks on Peg 1 (or sometimes Peg A), so we'll adjust our understanding to fit the given initial condition.\n\nLet's denote the disks as D1 (smallest), D2, D3, and D4 (largest), and the pegs as P1, P2, and P3. The initial state is that all disks are stacked on P2, and we need to move them to P3.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial and goal states.\nThe initial state is D4, D3, D2, D1 on P2. The goal is to have D4, D3, D2, D1 on P3.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.\nTo move the stack from P2 to P3, we need to move the top 3 disks (D3, D2, D1) out of the way first, which involves moving them to P1, so D4 can be moved to P3.\n\n## Step 3: Move D1, D2, and D3 from P2 to P1.\nTo do this, we follow the Tower of Hanoi algorithm for 3 disks: Move D1 from P2 to P3, D2 from P2 to P1, D1 from P3 to P1, D3 from P2 to P3, D1 from P1 to P2, D2 from P1 to P3, D1 from P2 to P3.\n\n## Step 4: Execute the moves for Step 3.\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n## Step 5: Move D4 from P2 to P3.\nNow that the top 3 disks are on P3 (but we actually need to adjust our steps as per the correct sequence for 4 disks), we directly move D4.\n\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\n## Step 6: Correct the understanding and directly solve for 4 disks.\nFor 4 disks on P2 to be moved to P3, we need to:\n1. Move the top 3 disks (D1, D2, D3) from P2 to P1.\n2. Move D4 from P2 to P3.\n3. Move the stack (D1, D2, D3) from P1 to P3.\n\n## Step 7: Execute the correct sequence for 4 disks.\nFirst, move 3 disks from P2 to P1:\n- Move D1 from P2 to P3\n- Move D2 from P2 to P1\n- Move D1 from P3 to P1\n- Move D3 from P2 to P3\n- Move D1 from P1 to P2\n- Move D2 from P1 to P3\n- Move D1 from P2 to P3\n- Move D4 from P2 to P1 (No, this is incorrect as per the initial steps; correctly it should be part of the larger sequence)\n\nLet's directly apply the Tower of Hanoi solution:\n1.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we'll use a modified version of the classic algorithm that takes advantage of the additional peg to reduce the number of moves required. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs requires 2^n - 1 moves, where n is the number of disks. For 6 disks, this would be 2^6 - 1 = 63 moves. However, with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is more efficient.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and solving the problem in stages. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can divide the problem as follows:\n\n1. Move the top 3 disks to Peg 2 (using Peg 3 and Peg 4 as auxiliary pegs).\n2. Move the next 2 disks (4th and 5th) to Peg 3 and Peg 4, but for the optimal strategy, we directly move the 4th disk to Peg 3 (using the 3-peg algorithm for the top 3 and then moving the 4th disk).\n3.

The Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests that for n disks and k pegs, we should find an optimal 'p' such that we move the top n-p disks to one spare peg, then the remaining p disks to the destination peg using the remaining (k-2) spare pegs, and finally move the n-p disks on top.\n\n2. The optimal 'p' for 6 disks and 4 pegs can be determined by trial and error or using a formula if available. For 6 disks, a common division is to move the top 3 disks out of the way first.\n\nLet's directly apply a known solution strategy for 6 disks on 4 pegs:\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs efficiently, we can use a variation of the algorithm designed for the multipeg Tower of Hanoi problem. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is one such method for solving the Tower of Hanoi with more than 3 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. For n disks and k pegs, choose a number of disks, p, to move to an intermediate peg.\n2. Move the top p disks to one intermediate peg using all k pegs.\n3. Move the remaining (n-p) disks to the destination peg using (k-1) pegs (since one peg is occupied by the p disks), following the standard Tower of Hanoi rules for (k-1) pegs.\n4. Move the p disks from the intermediate peg to the destination peg using all k pegs.\n\nFor 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can choose p = 2 (though the optimal p can depend on the specific algorithm variation and the number of disks and pegs).\n\nHere's a simplified step-by-step solution:\n\n## Step 1: Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove

Peg Y: Move disk 1 from Peg X to Peg Z, Move disk 2 from Peg X to Peg Y, Move disk 1 from Peg Z to Peg Y.\n- Move 3 disks: Move 2 disks from Peg X to Peg Y, Move disk 3 from Peg X to Peg Z, Move 2

The classic Tower of Hanoi algorithm for 3 pegs is well-known, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a more complex algorithm that minimizes the number of moves.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. For n disks, choose a number k (0 \u2264 k < n) to move the top k disks to one of the auxiliary pegs.\n2. Move the remaining (n-k) disks to the destination peg, using the remaining pegs as auxiliary.\n3.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, we need to understand the recursive nature of the solution. The basic idea is to move the top n-1 disks to a spare peg, then move the nth disk to the target peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the spare peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's denote the source peg as Peg 1, the target peg as Peg 2, and the spare peg as Peg 3.\n\n## Step 1: Move the top 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nTo do this, we follow the same Tower of Hanoi procedure recursively.\n\n## Step 2: Move the 7th disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nThis is the base large move that allows us to then move the other disks on top of it.\n\n## Step 3: Move the 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nAgain, this involves a recursive application of the Tower of Hanoi solution.\n\nLet's directly generate the sequence based on the Tower of Hanoi algorithm.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, we will follow a recursive algorithm that is typically used for this problem. The steps involve moving the top n-1 disks to a spare peg, then moving the nth disk to the target peg, and finally moving the n-1 disks from the spare peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's denote the source peg as Peg 1, the target peg as Peg 2, and the spare peg as Peg 3.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the recursive nature of the Tower of Hanoi problem.\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem is solved using a recursive approach. For n disks, the solution involves: moving n-1 disks from the source to the spare peg, moving the nth disk from the source to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the spare peg to the target peg.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the recursive algorithm for 7 disks.\nTo move 7 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2, we need to follow the recursive steps:\n1. Move 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n2. Move the 7th disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n3. Move 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\n## Step 3: Break down the movement of 6 disks.\nTo move 6 disks from one peg to another, we apply the same recursive logic:\n1. Move 5 disks from the source peg to the spare peg.\n2. Move the 6th disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n3. Move 5 disks from the spare peg to the target peg.\n\n## Step 4: Continue the breakdown until we reach the base case (1 disk).\nThe base case is moving 1 disk, which is a simple move from the source peg to the target peg.\n\n## Step 5: Generate the sequence of moves based on the recursive algorithm.\nLet's directly generate the moves for 7 disks using the standard Tower of Hanoi algorithm.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg
