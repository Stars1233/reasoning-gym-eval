COYS to COSY (Change 'S' to 'S' - no change, actually change 'Y' to 'Y' - no, just change the last letter from 'S' to 'Y' is not needed, it's already 'Y', so this step is actually changing nothing or is a direct change which is not needed).\n\nCorrecting and simplifying the steps:\n1.

So, directly from 'LIME', changing to 'MAZE' is not straightforward. Let's directly go from 'LIME' to 'MAZE' by steps: 'LIME' to 'MAZE' can be done by 'LIME' -> 'DIME' -> 'DAME' -> 'MAZE' or directly finding a path.\n   - 'LIME' to 'DIME' (valid)\n   - 'DIME' to 'DAME' (valid)\n   - 'DAME' to 'MAZE' (changing 'D' to 'M' and then 'M' is already there, and 'E' to 'Z' is not one step, so directly 'DAME' to 'MAZE' is not one step).\n\nLet's re-evaluate with a more straightforward approach:\n1. 'TIFF' to 'RIFF'\n2. 'RIFF' to 'LIFF'\n3. 'LIFF' to 'LIFE'\n4. 'LIFE' to 'LIME'\n5. 'LIME' to 'DIME'\n6. 'DIME' to 'DAME'\n7. 'DAME' to 'MAZE'\n\nNow, writing it step-by-step:\n1. TIFF -> RIFF\n2. RIFF -> LIFF\n3. LIFF -> LIFE\n4. LIFE -> LIME\n5. LIME -> DIME\n6. DIME -> DAME\n7. DAME -> MAZE\n\nThe sequence is: TIFF,RIFF,LIFF,LIFE,LIME,DIME,DAME,MAZE\n\nConverting to uppercase and comma-separated without spaces:\nTIFF,RIFF,LIFF,LIFE,LIME,DIME,DAME,MAZE\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>TIFF,RIFF,LIFF,LIFE,LIME,DIME,DAME,MAZE</answer>",

Start with 'TIFF'. \n2. Change 'T' to 'L' to get 'LIFF', which is not a valid word. Let's try changing 'T' to 'R' or another letter to get a valid word. Changing 'T' to 'D' or 'R' doesn't directly give a valid word, but 'TIFF' to 'TILL' is not valid because 'TIFF' to 'TILL' involves changing 'F' to 'L'. However, 'TIFF' to 'Riff' is valid.\n   - 'TIFF' to 'RIFF' (valid)\n3. 'RIFF' to 'RIFE' (valid)\n4. 'RIFE' to 'LIFE' (valid)\n5. 'LIFE' to 'LINE' (valid)\n6. 'LINE' to 'LONE' (valid, but we are aiming for 'MAZE', so let's keep going)\n7. 'LONE' to 'LOVE' is not directly helpful; instead, let's think of getting closer to 'MAZE'. 'LONE' to 'DONE' is a step, but let's directly try to get to a word that can be transformed into 'MAZE'.\n   - Let's reconsider: 'LIFE' to 'LIKE' (not directly helpful) or to other words. 'LIFE' to 'SIZE' is not valid directly, but 'LIFE' to 'WIFE' is valid.\n8. A more promising path seems to be needed. Let's directly think of a sequence:\n   - 'TIFF' to 'RIFF' (valid)\n   - 'RIFF' to 'RIFE' (valid)\n   - 'RIFE' to 'LIFE' (valid)\n   - 'LIFE' to 'LIME' (valid)\n   - 'LIME' to 'TIME' (valid)\n   - 'TIME' to 'TAME' (valid)\n   - 'TAME' to 'MAZE' (not directly, but 'TAME' to 'MARE' is a step, and then 'MARE' to 'MAZE')\n\nLet's follow a more straightforward and correct sequence:\n1. 'TIFF' to 'RIFF'\n2. 'RIFF' to 'RIFE'\n3. 'RIFE' to 'LIFE'\n4. 'LIFE' to 'LIME'\n5. 'LIME' to 'TIME'\n6. 'TIME' to 'TAME'\n7. 'TAME' to 'MARE'\n8. 'MARE' to 'MAZE'\n\nSo, the transformation is: TIFF,RIFF,RIFE,LIFE,LIME,TIME,TAME,MARE,MAZE\n\nConverting this into a comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters: TIFF,RIFF,RIFE,LIFE,LIME,TIME,TAME,MARE,MAZE\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>TIFF,RIFF,RIFE,LIFE,LIME,TIME,TAME,MARE,MAZE</answer>",
