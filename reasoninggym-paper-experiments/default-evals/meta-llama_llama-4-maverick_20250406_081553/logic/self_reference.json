However, this would mean Statement 3 is false because it asserts all statements are true, creating a contradiction. Thus, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the Implication of Statement 3 Being False on Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.') being true implies that Statement 4 must be true because Statement 3 is false. If Statement 4 is true, it means 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are false. This implies that 3 statements are true. We need to check if this condition can satisfy the other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 1 with the Condition from Statement 4\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' Given that we've established 3 statements are true (from Step 3), Statement 1 is false because it claims all 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Examine Statement 2 with the Condition from Statement 4\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Since we've determined that 4 statements are false (from Statement 4 being true), Statement 2 is false.\n\n## Step 6: Check the Truthfulness of Statement 5\nStatement 5 is 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' With 3 true statements, this is true because 3 is a prime number.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Since there are 4 false statements and 4 is a composite number, Statement 7 is true.\n\n## Step 9: Summarize the Truthfulness of All Statements Based on Previous Steps\n- Statement 1: False (because not all 7 are true)\n- Statement 2: False (because more than 2 are false)\n- Statement 3: False (as determined in Step 1)\n- Statement 4: True (as deduced in Step 2 and Step 3)\n- Statement 5: True (as it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both)\n- Statement 6: True (since 3 is prime)\n- Statement 7: True (since 4 is composite)\n\n## Step 10: Verify if the Number of True and False Statements Matches the Conditions\nWe have 3 true statements (Statements 4, 5, 6, 7) and 4 false statements (Statements 1, 2, 3). Actually, the count is 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which contradicts our initial assumption based on Statement 4 being true. Let's correct this: If Statement 4 is true, then there are 4 false and 3 true statements. The true statements are indeed 4 (4, 5, 6, 7), which does not match our initial interpretation. Let's re-evaluate: If 4 statements are true, then Statements 1, 2, 3 must be false. Statement 1 being false is consistent with not all being true. Statement 2 being false is consistent with more than 2 being false. Statement 3 being false is consistent with our initial finding.\n\n## Step 11: Re-check the Consistency of the Statements\nLet's directly assess the possible truth values based on the conditions given and verify the consistency:\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are false and 3 are true. The statements that are true are Statements 4, 5, 6, and 7, which totals 4 true statements, not 3. This is a contradiction because Statement 4 says there are 4 false statements, implying 3 true statements.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the Possibility of Statement 4 Being False\nIf Statement 4 is false, then Statement 5 being true implies Statement 3 is true because Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, we've established Statement 3 is false. Thus, if Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 must be false because Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 13: Check for Other Possible Combinations\nLet's directly check the statements for possible solutions without assuming Statement 4 is true:\n1. Statement 1: At least 7 true. This can only be true if all statements are true.\n2. Statement 2: At most 2 false. This is false if more than 2 statements are false.\n3. Statement 3: Exactly 0 true. This is false because it implies all statements are false, which would make it true, a contradiction.\n\n## Step 14: Detailed Examination of Possible Scenarios\nLet's consider the number of true statements (T) and false statements (F).

However, this creates a contradiction because if all statements are false, then Statement 3 cannot be true. Thus, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the Implication of Statement 3 Being False on Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 is false, for Statement 5 ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.') to be true, Statement 4 must be true because Statement 5 requires exactly one of them to be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 states 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' If Statement 4 is true, then there are 4 false statements and 3 true statements. We need to check if this condition can satisfy the other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 1 with the Knowledge that Statement 4 is True\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' Given that Statement 4 is true and implies 3 true statements, Statement 1 must be false because it claims all 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Since we've established that Statement 4 is true and there are 3 true statements (because Statement 4 being true means 3 statements are true), this implies 4 false statements, making Statement 2 false.\n\n## Step 6: Assess Statement 6\nStatement 6 states 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'

If Statement 4 is true, it means 4 statements are false and 3 are true. The statements that are true are Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. However, this creates a contradiction as we've seen. Let's directly check the conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Check the Conditions for Statement 1 to Statement 7\nLet's analyze the statements again with the condition that Statement 4 is true:\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are false. This means Statements 1, 2, and 3 must be among the false ones, which is consistent with our findings. Statement 5, 6, and 7 being true satisfies the prime and composite conditions for true and false statements respectively.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed Check of All Statements\nLet's verify if having 3 true statements (as per Statement 4) is possible:\n- True Statements: Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 (4 true statements, not 3, which is a contradiction).\nLet's directly analyze the truthfulness:\n- For Statement 4 to be true, we need 4 false and 3 true statements. But if Statement 4 is true, then Statements 5, 6, and 7 being true gives us 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze Alternative Scenarios\nLet's consider if Statement 4 is false. Then, Statement 5 being true implies Statement 3 is true because Statement 4 is false. However, we've established Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the Scenario When Statement 4 is False\nIf Statement 4 is false, then Statement 5 being true means Statement 3 must be true, which is not possible as per Step 1. So, Statement 5 must be false if Statement 4 is false.\n\n## Step 14: Check for Other Possible Combinations\nLet's directly check the number of true statements:\n- Let's assume the number of true statements is T. Then, Statement 1 is true if T >= 7, Statement 2 is true if T >= 5, Statement 3 is true if T = 0, Statement 4 is true if T = 3, Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, Statement 6 is true if T is prime, and Statement 7 is true if 7-T is composite.\n\n## Step 15: Final Analysis\nLet's check for T = 3 (as per Statement 4):\n- Statement 1: False\n- Statement 2: False\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: True (because Statement 4 is true)\n- Statement 6: True (3 is prime)\n- Statement 7: True (4 is composite)\nThis gives 4 true statements, not 3, so it's not valid.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Let's analyze them one by one to understand their implications.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that all 7 statements must be true because it says \"at least 7\" and there are only 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 5 of the statements must be true because if 2 or fewer are false, then 5 or more must be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.' This means all statements are false. If this is true, then it must be false because it claims all statements are false, including itself.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.'

This aligns with Statement 4's claim.\n\n## Step 8: Check if Statement 1 can be true\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4 being true (since Statement 4 says exactly 4 are false). So, Statement 1 must be false.\n\n## Step 9: Check the truthfulness of Statement 2\nGiven that exactly 4 statements are false (from Statement 4 being true), Statement 2 ('At most 2 of these 7 statements are false') is false because 4 is more than 2.\n\n## Step 10: Verify Statement 5's truthfulness based on Statements 3 and 4\nStatement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is true, so Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'

The true statements are Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. However, this gives us 4 true statements, not 3, which is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Resolve the contradiction\nLet's directly check the possible configurations:\n1.

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze the given statements. Statement 1 claims that at least 5 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 claims that at most 0 of the 7 statements are false, implying all statements are true. Statement 3 states that exactly 5 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 4 states that exactly 4 of the 7 statements are false, which means exactly 3 are true. Statement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2.\nStatement 2 says that at most 0 of these 7 statements are false, which means all 7 statements must be true. If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true because 7 is at least 5. Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 5 are true, not 7. Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 4 are false, which contradicts all being true. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, making the condition of \"either...or\" false, but since both are false, it actually aligns with the condition of \"but not both\" being true in a sense that it's not about being true or false but about the exclusivity. However, Statement 5 is more nuanced and depends on the truth values of Statements 3 and 4. Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 0 (the number of false statements if all are true) is not considered a composite number. Thus, if all statements are true, Statements 3, 4, and 7 are false, which contradicts the premise that all statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 2 being true.\nGiven that Statement 2 being true leads to a contradiction (since not all statements can be true if we consider the implications of Statements 3, 4, and 7), Statement 2 must be false. This means at least one statement is false.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the implications of Statement 1 being true.\nIf Statement 1 is true, then at least 5 statements are true. This means out of 7 statements, 5, 6, or 7 must be true.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the possible scenarios based on the number of true statements.\nLet's examine the cases where 5, 6, or 7 statements are true and check their validity against all statements.\n\n## Step 6: Check the case where 7 statements are true.\nWe've already established that if 7 statements are true, it leads to a contradiction due to Statements 3, 4, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Check the case where 6 statements are true.\nIf 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. Statement 1 is true because at least 5 are true. Statement 2 is false (which fits as one false statement), Statement 3 is false (because exactly 5 are not true), Statement 4 is true (since 1 is false, making 6 true and 1 false, which doesn't exactly fit Statement 4's claim of 4 being false), Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, satisfying \"either...or but not both\". Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 4, 5, 7 true and Statements 2, 3, 6 false. This gives us 4 true statements, not 6, so it doesn't fit.\n\n## Step 8: Check the case where 5 statements are true.\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 is false (because it says 4 are false, but we have 2 false). Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number. Statement 7 is true because 2 is a composite number (though 2 is actually a prime number, not composite, this makes Statement 7 false). So, Statements 1, 3, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 2, 4, 7 are false. This gives us 4 true statements, which doesn't match our condition of 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate the conditions and directly assess the statements for possible truth values.\nLet's directly check the statements. For 5 true statements: Statements 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 being true implies Statements 2 and 4 are false. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (correct), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false (correct), Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime, and Statement 7 is true because 2 is not composite but this makes it false. So, this scenario doesn't work because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the prime and composite conditions.\nFor a number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6), it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), given 7 statements, it could be 4 (since 4 is composite).\n\n## Step 11: Check for the number of true statements being prime.\nIf the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7, we check these cases. For 2 true, Statements 1 and 6 cannot both be true. For 3 true, it's also not possible because Statement 1 will be false. For 5 true, we've seen issues. For 7 true, we've established it's not possible.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate Statement 4 and Statement 5 together.\nStatement 4 being true means 3 statements are true. Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Thus, if all statements are true, Statements 3, 4, and 7 are false, which contradicts the premise that all statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 2 being true.\nGiven that Statement 2 being true leads to a contradiction (since not all statements can be true if we consider the implications of Statements 3, 4, and 7), Statement 2 must be false. This means at least one statement is false.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the implications of Statement 1 being true.\nIf Statement 1 is true, then at least 5 statements are true. This means out of 7 statements, 5, 6, or 7 must be true.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the possible scenarios based on the number of true statements.\nLet's examine the cases where 5, 6, or 7 statements are true and check their validity against all statements.\n\n## Step 6: Check the case where 7 statements are true.\nWe've already established that if 7 statements are true, it leads to a contradiction due to Statements 3, 4, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Check the case where 6 statements are true.\nIf 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. Statement 1 is true because at least 5 are true. Statement 2 is false (which fits as one false statement), Statement 3 is false (because exactly 5 are not true), Statement 4 is true (since 1 is false, making 6 true and 1 false, which doesn't exactly fit Statement 4's claim of 4 being false), Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, satisfying \"either...or but not both\". Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 4, 5, 7 true and Statements 2, 3, 6 false. This gives us 4 true statements, not 6, so it doesn't fit.\n\n## Step 8: Check the case where 5 statements are true.\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 is false (because it says 4 are false, but we have 2 false). Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number. Statement 7 is true because 2 is a composite number (though 2 is actually a prime number, not composite, this makes Statement 7 false). So, Statements 1, 3, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 2, 4, 7 are false. This gives us 4 true statements, which doesn't match our condition of 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate the conditions and directly assess the statements for possible truth values.\nLet's directly check the statements. For 5 true statements: Statements 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 being true implies Statements 2 and 4 are false. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (correct), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false (correct), Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime, and Statement 7 is true because 2 is not composite but this makes it false. So, this scenario doesn't work because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the prime and composite conditions.\nFor a number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6), it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), given 7 statements, it could be 4 (since 4 is composite).\n\n## Step 11: Check for the number of true statements being prime.\nIf the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7, we check these cases. For 2 true, Statements 1 and 6 cannot both be true. For 3 true, it's also not possible because Statement 1 will be false. For 5 true, we've seen issues. For 7 true, we've established it's not possible.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate Statement 4 and Statement 5 together.\nStatement 4 being true means 3 statements are true. Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

We need to analyze each statement and determine the possible number of true and false statements among them.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means the number of true statements (T) is $T \\geq 5$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that there are 0 false statements, so $T = 7$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means $T = 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T = 3$ because if 4 out of 7 are false, 3 are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' For Statement 5 to be true, either $T = 5$ or $T = 3$ must be true, but not both.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 for this statement to be true.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The number of false statements is $7 - T$. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For $7 - T$ to be composite, $7 - T$ should be 4 or 6 because those are the composite numbers less than 7. This implies $T = 3$ or $T = 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the statements\nLet's examine the possible values of $T$ based on the statements:\n- From Statement 2, if $T = 7$, then all statements must be true. We need to check if this satisfies all other statements.\n- Statement 1 is true if $T \\geq 5$.\n- Statement 3 is true if $T = 5$.\n- Statement 4 is true if $T = 3$.\n- Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both.\n- Statement 6 is true if $T$ is prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 is true if $7 - T$ is composite (4 or 6), meaning $T = 3$ or $T = 1$.\n\n## Step 10: Check if $T = 7$ is a valid solution\nIf $T = 7$, then all statements are true. Statement 1 is true because $7 \\geq 5$. Statement 2 is true because there are 0 false statements. Statement 3 is false because $T \\neq 5$, so $T = 7$ cannot be a solution since it makes Statement 3 false.\n\n## Step 11: Examine possible values of $T$ based on individual statements\nLet's directly check the validity of $T$ based on the constraints given by the statements:\n- For $T = 7$, Statements 1, 2, and 6 are true. However, Statement 3 is false, which contradicts $T = 7$ because Statement 3 being false is consistent with $T = 7$ but Statement 2 being true implies all are true, creating a contradiction with Statement 3. So, $T = 7$ is not valid due to the falsity of Statement 3.\n- For $T = 5$, Statements 1, 3, and 6 are true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 7 is false because $7 - 5 = 2$ is not composite. So, $T = 5$ gives us 5 true statements (1, 3, 5, 6, and potentially one more), which is plausible.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed check for $T = 5$\nLet's see if $T = 5$ can satisfy all conditions:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: False\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: False\n- Statement 5: True (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false)\n- Statement 6: True\n- Statement 7: False\nThis gives us $T = 5$ with Statements 1, 3, 5, 6 being true. To have $T = 5$, one more statement must be true. Statement 2, 4, or 7 being true would not work because it would either make $T > 5$ or not satisfy the condition of being exactly 5. So, we need to check the consistency.\n\n## Step 13: Checking $T = 3$ and $T = 2$ (from Statement 6) for validity\nFor $T = 3$, Statements 4 and 7 are true. Statement 6 is also true because 3 is prime. Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Here, Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false, so Statement 5 is true. This gives us 4 true statements so far (4, 5, 6, 7), which exceeds $T = 3$. Thus, $T = 3$ is not valid upon detailed inspection because it cannot satisfy the condition that exactly 3 statements are true given the constraints.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate the number of possible solutions based on the analysis\nFrom the steps above, $T = 5$ is a potential solution where Statements 1, 3, 5, 6 are true, and Statement 2, 4, 7 are false. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true ($T = 5$), Statement 2 is false ($T = 5$, not 7), Statement 3 is true ($T = 5$), Statement 4 is false ($T = 3$, not 4 false), Statement 5 is true (Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is true ($T = 5$ is prime), and Statement 7 is false ($7 - T = 2$ is not composite).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means $T = 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T = 3$ because if 4 out of 7 statements are false, 3 are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' For Statement 5 to be true, either $T = 5$ (from Statement 3) or $T = 3$ (from Statement 4) must be true, but not both.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'

The number of false statements is $7 - T$. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $7 - T = 4$ or $6$, meaning $T = 3$ or $1$ for Statement 7 to be true.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the statements\n- If $T = 7$ (from Statement 2), then all statements must be true. However, Statement 4 ($T = 3$) and Statement 7 ($T = 3$ or $1$) cannot be true if $T = 7$, so $T = 7$ is not possible because it contradicts Statements 4 and 7.\n- Statement 2 being true implies $T = 7$, which we've established is not possible due to the contradictions with other statements.\n\n## Step 10: Check for $T = 5$ as per Statement 3\nIf $T = 5$, then Statements 1, 3, and 6 are true because 5 is prime. Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true. Statement 7 is false because $7 - 5 = 2$, which is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 3, 5, 6 true, and Statements 2, 4, 7 false, which gives $T = 4$, not 5. Thus, $T = 5$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 11: Check for $T = 3$ as per Statement 4\nIf $T = 3$, then Statement 1 is false because $T < 5$. Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because $7 - 3 = 4$, which is composite. Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is true. So, we have Statements 4, 5, 6, 7 true, which gives $T = 4$, not 3. Thus, $T = 3$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the possibility of other $T$ values\nFor $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 2 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since $7-2 = 5$, which is not composite). This doesn't directly help without checking all statements.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check for $T = 3$\nLet's directly check the statements for $T = 3$: Statements 4, 6, and 7 are true. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, and Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. So, Statements 4, 5, 6, 7 are true, which means $T = 4$, contradicting our assumption.\n\n## Step 14: Checking for valid configurations\nLet's directly assess the validity of statements for different $T$.\n- For $T = 7$, it's not valid as shown.\n- For $T = 5$, we need to check if it can satisfy all conditions. It doesn't work as shown in Step 10.\n- For $T = 3$, it doesn't work as shown in Step 11.\n\n## Step 15: Final evaluation\nLet's consider the constraints:\n- Statement 2 implies $T = 7$, which is not valid.\n- For $T = 5$, Statements 1, 3, 5, 6 are true, and 2, 4, 7 are false. This gives $T = 4$, which is not consistent.\n- The valid $T$ must satisfy multiple conditions. Let's directly check the statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's understand and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 4 of the statements are true because 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true,' which implies 2 are false. Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false,' which implies 5 are true. Both statements essentially say the same thing, just from the perspective of true or false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent in meaning (both stating that 5 statements are true and 2 are false), Statement 5 must be false because it is impossible for one to be true and the other false if they are saying the same thing.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the implications of Statement 5 being false\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we know that either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false. However, they cannot both be true because they are equivalent statements. Thus, both must be false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not 5. This means the actual number of true statements is not 5, and thus, the number of false statements is not 2.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the number of true and false statements based on Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false\nWith Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false, we have at least 2 false statements (Statement 3 and Statement 4, and Statement 5). So, we have at least 3 false statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' If we have at least 3 false statements, then we have at most 4 true statements. This means Statement 1 can still be true if we have 2, 3, or 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Check Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Having at least 3 false statements (as deduced) means we could have 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 false statements. Statement 2 is true if we have 3 or fewer false statements. So, it's true if we have exactly 3 false statements (and thus 4 true statements), but false if we have more than 3 false statements.\n\n## Step 10: Examine possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's examine the possible number of true statements: If we have 4 true statements, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 needs to be checked (4 is not prime), and Statement 7 needs to be checked (3 is not composite). Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\n\n## Step 11: Check the scenario with 4 true statements\nWith 4 true statements (and thus 3 false), the true statements could be Statement 1, Statement 2, and two others. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. The false statements are Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. This gives us 2 true statements (Statement 1 and Statement 2) and 5 false statements, which contradicts our assumption of 4 true statements. So, let's directly check the validity of having 4 true statements: If Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are the true statements, it contradicts because Statement 6 and Statement 7 cannot both be true when the number of true statements is 4 (since 4 is not prime and 3 is not composite). However, we should directly assess the statements.\n\n## Step 12: Directly assess the possible number of true statements\nLet's directly check the statements: If we have 4 true statements, the false ones are Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5 (already known), and one more. For 4 true statements, Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), so one of the false statements is Statement 6. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 7 true. Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements (3) is composite, which is false because 3 is not composite. So, having 4 true statements does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n## Step 13: Check for other possible numbers of true statements\nFor 3 true statements, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false because we have 4 false statements. Statement 6 could be true if 3 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 could be true if 4 is composite, which it is. So, having 3 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 6, Statement 7) is a possibility.\n\n## Step 14: Verify the scenario with 3 true statements\nWith 3 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite). Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5 are false. This satisfies the conditions: Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false,' which implies 5 are true. Both statements essentially say the same thing, just from the perspective of true or false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent in meaning (both stating that 5 statements are true and 2 are false), Statement 5 must be false because it is impossible for one to be true and the other false if they are saying the same thing.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the implications of Statement 5 being false\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we know that either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false. However, they cannot both be true because they are equivalent statements. Thus, both must be false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not 5. This means the actual number of true statements is not 5, and thus, the number of false statements is not 2.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the number of true and false statements based on Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false\nWith Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false, we have at least 2 false statements (Statement 3 and Statement 4, and Statement 5).

Having at least 3 false statements (as deduced) means we could have 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 false statements. Statement 2 is true if we have 3 or fewer false statements. So, it's true if we have exactly 3 false statements (and thus 4 true statements), but false if we have more than 3 false statements.\n\n## Step 10: Examine possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's examine the possible number of true statements: If we have 4 true statements, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 needs to be checked (4 is not prime), and Statement 7 needs to be checked (3 is not composite). Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\n\n## Step 11: Check the scenario with 4 true statements\nWith 4 true statements (and thus 3 false), the true statements could be Statement 1, Statement 2, and two others. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. The false statements are Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. This gives us 2 true statements (Statement 1 and Statement 2) and 5 false statements, which contradicts our assumption of 4 true statements. So, let's directly check the validity of having 4 true statements: If Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are the true statements, it contradicts because Statement 6 and Statement 7 cannot both be true when the number of true statements is 4 (since 4 is not prime and 3 is not composite). However, we should directly assess the statements.\n\n## Step 12: Directly assess the possible number of true statements\nLet's directly check the statements: If we have 4 true statements, the false ones are Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5 (already known), and one more. For 4 true statements, Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), so one of the false statements is Statement 6. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 7 true. Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements (3) is composite, which is false because 3 is not composite. So, having 4 true statements does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n## Step 13: Check for other possible numbers of true statements\nFor 3 true statements, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false because we have 4 false statements. Statement 6 could be true if 3 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 could be true if 4 is composite, which it is. So, having 3 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 6, Statement 7) is a possibility.\n\n## Step 14: Verify the scenario with 3 true statements\nWith 3 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite). Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5 are false. This satisfies the conditions: Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This implies $F$ is composite. Since $F = 7 - T$, the composite numbers for $F$ (considering $T$ and $F$ are integers and $T + F = 7$) correspond to $T = 0, 1, 2, 5, 6$ because $F$ would be $7, 6, 5, 2, 1$ respectively, and among these, $6$ and $4$ are not possible values for $F$ that are composite and satisfy $T + F = 7$, but $4$ is composite and corresponds to $T = 3$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' However, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 state that $T = 5$. Thus, Statement 5 is false because it is impossible for exactly one of them to be true when they are equivalent.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the problem based on Statement 5 being false\nSince Statement 5 is false, $F = 1$ (because it's one of the 7 statements), and $T = 6$. Let's check if $T = 6$ satisfies the other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Check the truthfulness of other statements when $T = 6$\n- Statement 1: $T = 6 \\geq 2$, so it's true.\n- Statement 2: $F = 1 \\leq 3$, so it's true.\n- Statement 3: $T = 6 \\neq 5$, so it's false.\n- Statement 4: $T = 6 \\neq 5$, so it's false.\n- Statement 5: Already determined to be false.\n- Statement 6: $T = 6$ is not prime, so it's false.\n- Statement 7: $F = 1$ is not composite, so it's false.\n\n## Step 5: Verify if $T = 6$ is a valid solution\nWith $T = 6$, the true statements are Statements 1 and 2. Let's verify:\n- Statement 1 is true because $T = 6 \\geq 2$.\n- Statement 2 is true because $F = 1 \\leq 3$.\nThe other statements are false, which matches our initial assumption.\n\n## Step 6: Check other possible values of $T$ based on the constraints\nLet's directly evaluate the constraints:\n- From Statement 2, $T \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 both imply $T = 5$.\n- Statement 6 implies $T$ is prime, so $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze possible values for $T$ considering all statements\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is true, but Statement 2 is false because $T = 2$ implies $F = 5 > 3$. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 5$ is not composite but this needs checking against other statements. However, $T = 2$ doesn't satisfy Statement 2.\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime, and Statement 7 is false because $F = 4$ is composite. This gives $T = 3$ as a potential solution if it satisfies all true statements.\n- For $T = 5$, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, which contradicts Statement 5 being false unless Statement 5 is the false one among them, which it is. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because $F = 2$ is not composite.\n- For $T = 7$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. This doesn't satisfy Statement 2.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate $T = 5$ as a potential solution\nIf $T = 5$, then Statements 3, 4, and 6 are true. Statement 5 is false. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 7 is false. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as true, which gives $T = 5$. This is a valid configuration.\n\n## Step 9: Check if $T = 3$ is a valid solution\nFor $T = 3$, Statements 1, 2, and 6 are true. Statement 7 is false. Statements 3, 4, and 5 need to be evaluated for consistency. Statement 3 and 4 are false. Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since both are false, it is actually true, which creates a contradiction because we assumed $T = 3$ and Statement 5 being true would imply $T = 3$ is not a valid configuration under the given truth assignments.\n\n## Step 10: Summarize the valid solutions\nWe found two potential configurations: $T = 6$ and $T = 5$. Let's verify their validity directly against the statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This implies that the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 2.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 3, or T \u2265 4.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies T = 5.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies T = 5.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 both imply T = 5, they are essentially equivalent, making Statement 5 false because it asserts that only one of them can be true.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' This means T must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' This implies F is a composite number (4, 6), meaning T = 3 or T = 1.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5 and its implications\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent (both stating T = 5), Statement 5 is false because it claims that exactly one of them is true. Thus, F = 1 (since Statement 5 is false).\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the number of true statements\nGiven that Statement 5 is false, we have F = 1, which means T = 6.\n\n## Step 4: Check if T = 6 satisfies all statements\n- Statement 1: T = 6 \u2265 2, so it's true.\n- Statement 2: F = 1 \u2264 3, so it's true.\n- Statement 3: T = 6 \u2260 5, so it's false.\n- Statement 4: T = 6 \u2260 5, so it's false.\n- Statement 5: Already determined to be false.\n- Statement 6: T = 6 is not a prime number, so it's false.\n- Statement 7: F = 1 is not a composite number, so it's false.\n\n## Step 5: Verify the number of true and false statements\nWe have T = 6 ( Statements 1, 2 are true, and Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are false except for the fact that we need to count Statement 5 as false which we've established). Let's recount: Statements 1 and 2 are true. Statements 3, 4, 6, and 7 are false. Statement 5 is false. So, we actually have 2 true statements (1 and 2) and 5 false statements.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluate the initial assumption\nLet's directly check the statements with possible values of T.\n- For T = 6: Statements 1 and 2 are true. This contradicts our initial count because if T = 6, then Statements 3, 4, 6 should be examined closely. Statement 3 and 4 are false because T \u2260 5. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. So, we actually have a different distribution.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze possible values of T based on given conditions\nLet's directly analyze the statements:\n- If T = 7, then all statements must be true. But Statement 7 says F is composite, and if T = 7, F = 0, which is not composite. So, T \u2260 7.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. Statements 1 and 2 are true. Statement 5 is false. So, we need to check other statements.\n\n## Step 8: Detailed check for T = 5\nIf T = 5, then F = 2. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because F = 2 \u2264 3. Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 is true. Statement 5 is false because both 3 and 4 are true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. So, we have 5 true statements (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) and 2 false statements (5, 7), which matches T = 5.\n\n## Step 9: Check for other possible T\nFor T = 5, we have a valid solution as shown in Step 8.\n\n## Step 10: Count the number of possible solutions\nWe found that T = 5 is a valid solution. Let's verify if there are other valid T.\n- For T = 4, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (3 is not composite but F = 3). So, T = 4 gives us Statements 1, 2, 5, 7 as potentially true, but 7 is false because 3 is not composite. Thus, it's not a valid solution upon detailed check.\n- For T = 3, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (because F = 4), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (since both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). So, Statements 1, 5, 6, 7 are true, which gives T = 4, not 3. Thus, T = 3 is not valid.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This implies that the number of true statements is 6 or 7.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means the number of false statements is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, which simplifies to saying at least 0 statements are true. Essentially, this statement is always true because it includes all possibilities.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states the number of true statements.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 5 statements are true.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that 5 statements are true, they are essentially saying the same thing, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false if they are both true or both false. However, Statement 5 can be true if one of them is true and the other is false, but given their equivalence in implication, this creates a contradiction unless both are false.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not considered composite).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 is always true because it says \"at most 7 of these 7 statements are false,\" which is true regardless of the truth values of the other statements. So, Statement 2 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements are true. This means either 6 or 7 statements are true. If 7 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true, and it fits. If 6 statements are true, then Statement 1 is one of them, which is possible.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 say that 5 statements are true. If either is true, the other must be true as well because they both imply the same thing (5 true statements). Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. For Statement 5 to be true, it must be that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false because they cannot be one true and one false due to their equivalent implications.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's assess the possible number of true statements based on the given statements.\n- If 5 statements are true (as per Statement 3 and Statement 4), then Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number. Statement 7 would be false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. Statement 1 would be false because it says at least 6 are true. Statement 5 would be true if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, which aligns with our initial assessment that both cannot be true if Statement 5 is true.\n\n## Step 6: Check the consistency of the statements with the number of true statements\nLet's check the possible scenarios:\n1. If 5 statements are true: Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true. Statement 5 being true requires both Statement 3 and Statement 4 to be false. So, we have Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6 as true (3 so far), and Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 7 as potentially false or true based on other conditions. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. This gives us 3 true statements so far (2, 5, 6) and Statement 1 is false. This scenario does not work because we need 5 true statements.\n2. If 6 statements are true: Then Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and 6 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. This scenario cannot work because Statement 1 being true requires at least 6 true statements, but Statement 6 being false reduces the count.\n3. If 7 statements are true: Then all statements must be true. However, Statement 5 cannot be true if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n\n## Step 7: Detailed check for 5 true statements with Statement 5 being true\nFor 5 true statements, we need to satisfy Statement 6 (true because 5 is prime) and have Statement 7 false (because 2 is not composite). Statement 2 is true. Statement 5 being true means Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both false. So, true statements could be Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and two others. But we need exactly 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 8: Checking the validity of having 5 true statements with the given conditions\nLet's directly assess the feasibility:\n- Statement 1 is false because it claims at least 6 true statements.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since both are false, it is true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\nThis gives us Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6 as true, and Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 7 as false, totaling 3 true statements, not 5.\n\n## Step 9: Checking for other possible numbers of true statements\nLet's directly check the statements for other possible numbers of true statements:\n- For 6 true statements: Statement 1 is true. For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime, but 6 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. This gives us a contradiction because we assumed 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluating the number of possible solutions\nGiven the constraints and analyzing the statements, we need to find a configuration that satisfies all conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 implies that at most 1 statement is false. If true, then at least 6 statements must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 implies that at least 0 statements are true (since 7 - 7 = 0), which is always true because it allows for all statements to be false. It essentially says that not all statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify Statement 2 further\nStatement 2 is always true because it says 'at most 7 of these 7 statements are false', which means it allows for 0 to 7 false statements, making it a tautology.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says exactly 5 statements are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 2 statements are false (meaning 5 statements are true). Both statements cannot be true at the same time because they both imply the same number of true statements (5), making them equivalent in terms of the number of true statements they suggest.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply the same condition (5 true statements), Statement 5 is false because it asserts an exclusivity that doesn't apply due to their equivalence in implication.\n\n## Step 7: Assess the truthfulness based on Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements are true. Given Statement 5 is false (from Step 6), this means Statement 1 being true implies that at least 5 other statements must be true besides itself, making 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check the consistency of Statement 1 being true with other statements\nIf 6 statements are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true, which contradicts Statement 5 being true. However, we've established Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) is true if 6 statements are not true because 6 is not a prime number (it's composite), but if 5 or 7 statements are true, it could be true or false respectively (5 is prime, 7 is prime). Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) is false if there's 1 false statement because 1 is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the scenario where Statement 1 is true\nIf Statement 1 is true, and 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. The false statement cannot be Statement 2 (since it's always true). It also cannot be Statement 1 itself. Let's check: if Statement 1 is true, and there are 6 true statements, Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true would mean 5 true statements, which contradicts our assumption. However, we need to check all statements. Statement 5 is false, which fits. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Check the number of true statements when Statement 1 is true\nIf Statement 1 is true, we have at least 6 true statements. Let's directly check the statements: Statement 2 is true. If Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 1. If Statement 4 is true, it also implies 5 true statements, contradicting Statement 1. So, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must be false for Statement 1 to be true. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2 true, and the rest false, which gives us 2 true statements, contradicting our initial assumption that Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluate the statements for possible configurations\nLet's directly analyze possible configurations based on the statements. Statement 2 is always true. We need to check other statements for truth values.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the prime and composite conditions\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 13: Check for valid configurations\nLet's directly check valid configurations based on the number of true statements: If 7 statements are true, Statement 5 is false, which is a contradiction because it would mean 6 true statements. If 5 statements are true, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, making Statement 5 false. If 2 statements are true, Statement 7 is true (because 5 is composite), and it could be a valid configuration.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate specific configurations\nFor 5 true statements: Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6 (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite, this is false) are considered. Statement 5 is false. So, a possible configuration could be Statement 1 false, Statement 2 true, Statement 3 true, Statement 4 true, Statement 5 false, Statement 6 true, Statement 7 false, which gives 4 true statements, not 5.\n\n## Step 15: Final evaluation of configurations\nLet's check for 2 true statements: Statement 2 is true. If Statement 7 is true (because 5 is composite), then we have a possible configuration. Other statements being false: Statement 1 false (1 is not at least 6), Statement 3 false (not exactly 5 true), Statement 4 false (not exactly 2 false), Statement 5 false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, it actually makes Statement 5 true, which is a contradiction), Statement 6 false (2 is prime, so this is actually true).

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 0 statements are true because if 7 or fewer are false, then 0 or more are true. Thus, it is always true since you can't have more than 7 statements being false out of 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then 6 or 7 statements are true. We need to check the validity of this statement based on other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true,' and Statement 4 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false,' which implies 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Both statements cannot be true at the same time because they essentially say the same thing, making Statement 5's condition ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.') false if either is true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 5\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 is false because it requires one of them to be true and the other false. This is impossible since they convey the same information.\n\n## Step 6: Assess the truthfulness based on Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true. This would mean Statement 1 is true (since at least 6 are not true, this is a problem), Statement 5 is false (as determined), and we need to check the others. Statement 6 ('The number of true statements is a prime number.') would be false because 5 is prime, so this statement is actually true, not false. Statement 7 ('The number of false statements is a composite number.') would be false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 7: Check the scenario where exactly 5 statements are true\nIf exactly 5 statements are true, then Statement 1 is false (because not at least 6 are true), Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true satisfies the condition of 5 true statements. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. So, we have: Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 or Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (True), and Statement 7 (False). This gives us 4 true statements if we consider Statement 3 or Statement 4 as one true statement, and Statement 1 as false. However, we need exactly 5 true statements. Let's directly check the statements: If Statement 3 is true, then we have Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 6 as true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 1, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 7 as false. This gives 3 true statements, not 5. So, this scenario doesn't work under the condition that exactly 5 are true because it creates a contradiction.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 for possible true statement counts\nStatement 6 is true if the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 is true if the number of false statements is composite (4, 6). For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means 4 or 6 are false (3 or 1 true statements), and the number of true statements being prime means 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Check for possible solutions based on prime and composite conditions\nLet's directly analyze possible scenarios:\n- If 7 statements are true, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are all true. But Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, and Statement 5 is false if both are true, so this scenario is impossible.\n- If 2 statements are true (5 false), Statement 2 is true. For Statement 1 to be false, we need fewer than 6 true, so it's false. Statement 5 being false means either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false. Since both cannot be true, both must be false. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite. So, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 being true is a valid scenario but we need exactly 2 true statements. This doesn't fit.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed examination of possible true statement counts\nLet's examine the counts:\n- For 2 true statements: Statement 2 is true. For 5 false statements, Statement 7 is true. So, we have at least 2 true statements (Statement 2 and Statement 7), which contradicts having exactly 2 true.\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 2 is true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 4 is composite. So, we have a possible scenario where Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. This gives us 3 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6), which is a valid scenario.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Thus, Statement 1 and Statement 2 are equivalent.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true,' meaning all statements are false. If Statement 3 is true, then it must be false because it claims all statements are false, creating a contradiction. Thus, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false,' which implies 5 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then there are 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 5\nGiven Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.') being true implies Statement 4 must be true because Statement 3 is false. So, if Statement 5 is true, Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 6: Check the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true and 2 are false. This makes Statement 1 true (since at least 4 are true), Statement 2 true (since at most 3 are false), and Statement 4 true. Statement 5 is also true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 needs to be evaluated: if 5 statements are true, then the number of true statements (5) is prime, making Statement 6 true. Statement 7: if 2 statements are false, then the number of false statements is not composite (2 is prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 7: Verify the consistency of the statements when Statement 4 is true\nWith Statement 4 being true, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True because 5 is prime), and Statement 7 (False because 2 is not composite). This gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which is consistent with Statement 4.\n\n## Step 8: Check for other possible solutions\nLet's examine if there are other configurations that satisfy all given conditions. We already know Statement 3 is false. Let's directly check the number of true statements that could satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the number of true statements based on Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 10: Check the case where the number of true statements is 7\nIf all 7 statements are true, then Statement 3 is false, which creates a contradiction. So, this case is not possible.\n\n## Step 11: Check the case where the number of true statements is 5\nWe've already established this as a valid solution in Step 7.\n\n## Step 12: Check the case where the number of true statements is 3\nIf 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. Statement 1 and Statement 2 would be false because they require at least 4 true statements. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false because it claims exactly 2 statements are false. Statement 5 could be true if Statement 4 is false, but this needs Statement 3 to be true, which is not the case. So, Statement 5's truth value depends on the truth values of Statement 3 and Statement 4. Since both are false, Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false because 3 is prime, actually making it true, so this is a potential issue. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. So, we have Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (True), and Statement 7 (True), and two more need to be true. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false. This configuration (3 true, 4 false) doesn't satisfy Statement 1 and Statement 2 being true, and it has Statement 6 and Statement 7 as true, with one more true statement needed. However, making any of Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, or Statement 5 true would contradict the conditions. Thus, having exactly 3 true statements is not feasible under the given constraints because we cannot satisfy the condition of having exactly 3 true statements without contradicting the statements.\n\n## Step 13: Check the case where the number of true statements is 2\nIf 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. This makes Statement 1 and Statement 2 false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is true. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is false because 2 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite. So, we have Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True), and Statement 7 (True), which already gives us 3 true statements, contradicting our assumption of 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 14: Summarize findings\nWe have found one valid configuration where 5 statements are true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.

So, if Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 must be false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the Case When Statement 4 is False\nIf Statement 4 is false, then we don't have exactly 2 false statements. Let's examine the implications:\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate Other Statements Without Statement 4 Being True\nLet's consider the number of true statements (T) and false statements (F), where T + F = 7.\n- Statement 1: T >= 4.\n- Statement 2: F <= 3, which implies T >= 4.\n- Statement 6: T is prime.\n- Statement 7: F is composite.\n\n## Step 13: Examine Possible Values for T That Satisfy All True Statements\nPossible values for T that are prime and >= 4 are 5 and 7.

The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, the number of false statements (F) could be 4 or 6, implying T could be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent (both stating T = 4), Statement 5 is false because it claims that only one of them can be true.

This is a strong condition. If T = 7, then all statements must be true, but this contradicts Statement 5 being false. So, if T = 7, it's not possible because Statement 5 would be true. Thus, T = 6 is the only possibility under Statement 2.\n\n## Step 4: Check if T = 6 satisfies all conditions\nIf T = 6, then F = 1. Statement 1 is true because T = 6 \u2265 4. Statement 2 is true because F = 1. Statement 3 is false because T \u2260 4. Statement 4 is false because T \u2260 4. Statement 5 is false, which matches our initial finding. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is true because F = 1 is not composite, but this is a problem since it should be false. However, let's continue checking all statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. So, we have 2 true statements (Statement 1 and Statement 2), which contradicts T = 6. Thus, T = 6 is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 5: Examine Statement 1 and its implications with other statements\nGiven that Statement 5 is false, let's directly examine the possible values of T that satisfy the other statements and check for consistency.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the truthfulness based on the number of true statements\nLet's directly check the possible values of T:\n- For T = 7, all statements must be true, which is impossible because Statement 5 is false.\n- For T = 6, we've already seen it's not possible.\n- For T = 5, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). So, we have 2 true statements, which doesn't match T = 5.\n- For T = 4, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 3 is not composite, this is false). So, we have 3 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4), which doesn't match T = 4.\n- For T = 3, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, but Statement 5's condition is about exclusivity), Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 4 is composite, this is actually true). So, we have 2 true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 6), and Statement 7 is true, making 3 true statements. This matches T = 3.\n\n## Step 7: Verify T = 3 and T = 4 configurations\nFor T = 3: Statements 4, 6, and 7 are true. This gives us a valid configuration where T = 3 ( Statements 4, 6, and 7 are true, and the rest are false).\n\n## Step 8: Check for other possible configurations\nLet's verify if T = 4 can be a solution with a different combination: For T = 4, we need exactly 4 true statements. One possible configuration is Statements 1, 3, 4, and 7 being true. Let's check: Statement 1 is true (T \u2265 4), Statement 2 is false (T = 4, not T \u2265 6), Statement 3 is true (T = 4), Statement 4 is true (T = 4), Statement 5 is false (both 3 and 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (F = 3, which is not composite). So, Statements 1, 3, 4 are true, and Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. This doesn't satisfy T = 4.\n\n## Step 9: Summarize findings\nWe have found that T = 3 is a valid solution with Statements 4, 6, and 7 being true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

So, the number of false statements (F) could be 4 or 6, implying T could be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent (both stating T = 4), Statement 5 is false because it claims that only one of them can be true.

Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the statements into mathematical expressions\nLet's denote the number of true statements as $T$ and the number of false statements as $F$. Thus, $T + F = 7$. Statement 1: $T \\geq 4$. Statement 2: $F \\leq 1$. Statement 3: $T = 4$. Statement 4: $F = 3$. Statement 5: $(T = 4 \\text{ and } F \\neq 3) \\text{ or } (T \\neq 4 \\text{ and } F = 3)$. Statement 6: $T$ is prime. Statement 7: $F$ is composite.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 implies $F \\leq 1$, which means $T \\geq 6$ because $T + F = 7$. This directly contradicts Statement 1 being the only condition for $T$, as it suggests $T$ must be at least 6.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the implications of Statement 2 being true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then $F = 0$ or $F = 1$, meaning $T = 7$ or $T = 6$. This implies that at least 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Check the validity of $T = 7$ or $T = 6$\nFor $T = 7$, all statements must be true. Statement 7 would imply $F = 0$ is composite, which is false because 0 is not considered composite. Thus, $T = 7$ is not valid.\n\n## Step 6: Validate $T = 6$\nIf $T = 6$, then $F = 1$. Statement 1 is true because $T \\geq 4$. Statement 2 is true because $F = 1$. Statement 3 is false because $T \\neq 4$. Statement 4 is false because $F \\neq 3$. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, but it actually requires one to be true and the other false, so it's false. Statement 6 is false because $T = 6$ is not prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 1$ is not composite, it's actually not true since 1 is not composite, this statement is false. So, we have Statements 1, 2 being true, and Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 being examined for truthfulness. Actually, for $T = 6$, Statements 1, 2 are true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false because both 3 and 4 are false. Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 is false. So, we have 2 true statements, which contradicts $T = 6$. Hence, $T = 6$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 ($T = 4$) and Statement 4 ($F = 3$, hence $T = 4$) essentially say the same thing, that $T = 4$. Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, which is impossible since they are equivalent.\n\n## Step 8: Check the implications of Statement 5 being true or false\nIf Statement 5 is true, it implies that one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true and the other is false, which is a contradiction because they are equivalent. Thus, Statement 5 must be false. This means both Statement 3 and Statement 4 should either be true or false together.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the case when $T = 4$ (Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true)\nIf $T = 4$, then $F = 3$. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 is true. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 3 is not composite but it's actually a prime number, so this statement is false. So, we have Statements 1, 3, 4 being true, and Statements 2, 5, 6, 7 being false, which gives $T = 3$, contradicting our assumption.\n\n## Step 10: Check for other possible values of $T$ that satisfy the given conditions\nLet's directly check the possible values of $T$ and see which statements are true or false for each $T$. For $T = 4$, we've seen it doesn't work. For $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is prime, not composite). So, $T = 5$ gives us Statements 1, 6 as true, and the rest false, resulting in $T = 2$, which is not consistent.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze $T = 2, T = 3$ to see if any of them satisfy the conditions\nFor $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false (since $F = 5$), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false (since $F = 5$), Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false (2 is prime, so this is true), Statement 7 is true (5 is not composite, it's actually prime, so this is false). So, we have Statement 6 as true and the rest false, giving $T = 1$, which is not consistent.\n\nFor $T = 3$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), Statement 7 is false (4 is composite). So, we have Statements 4, 5, 6 as true, giving $T = 3$, which is consistent.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means if $T$ represents the number of true statements, then $T \\geq 4$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T \\geq 6$ because if at most 1 statement is false, then at least 6 must be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means $T = 4$ because if 3 are false, then 4 are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, if either is true, the other must be true as well, making Statement 5 false because it asserts they cannot both be true.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The number of false statements is $7 - T$. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $7 - T = 4$ or $6$, implying $T = 3$ or $1$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the implications of each statement together\n- From Step 2 and Step 3 indicate that if Statement 2 is true, then $T \\geq 6$.

Statement 1 is true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, but it claims one should be true and the other false. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because $7 - 6 = 1$ is not composite, so this scenario is not valid upon closer inspection due to the conditions it imposes.\n- If $T = 5$, then Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, satisfying its condition. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because $7 - 5 = 2$ is not composite. So, $T = 5$ gives us a potential solution where Statements 1, 5, and 6 are true.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed check for $T = 4$\nIf $T = 4$, then Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 is true. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because $7 - 4 = 3$ is not composite, it's actually not true, 3 is not composite. So, Statements 1, 3, 4 are true, and Statement 7 is false. This gives us $T = 4$ as a potential scenario with Statements 1, 3, and 4 being true.\n\n## Step 12: Checking the validity of $T = 4$ and $T = 5$\nFor $T = 4$: Statements 1, 3, 4 are true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 is false. This gives us 3 true statements, not 4, so it's not valid.\nFor $T = 5$: Statements 1, 5, 6 are true. This is a valid configuration because it satisfies the condition that $T = 5$.\n\n## Step 13: Checking other potential $T$ values\nFor $T = 3$: Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is true. Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is true. Here, Statements 4, 5, 6, 7 are true, which gives $T = 4$, not 3. So, this is not valid.\n\n## Step 14: Final evaluation\nLet's directly assess the truthfulness based on the conditions:\n- For $T = 5$, we have a valid configuration: Statements 1, 5, 6 are true, and the rest are false.

This implies all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total. If all 7 are true, then Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 6 out of the 7 statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for the possibility of 1 false statement among the 7.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then all other statements must be false. This creates a contradiction with Statement 1 and Statement 2 because if Statement 3 is true, Statement 1 and Statement 2 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means all statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, it leads to a contradiction because it asserts its own falseness.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but not both. Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (as they are mutually exclusive and one of them being true makes the other false), we need to examine the implications of each being true.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all other statements are false. This means Statement 5 is false. Statement 5 being false contradicts the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, because if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 should be true to satisfy its condition, creating a contradiction.\n\n## Step 8: Examine the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which again leads to a contradiction because Statement 4 cannot be true if all statements are false.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the truthfulness based on Statement 1 and Statement 2\nIf Statement 1 is true, all statements are true. However, this leads to a contradiction with Statement 4. Statement 2 being true allows for at most 1 false statement. If Statement 2 is true and there's exactly 1 false statement, it could potentially satisfy several conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate Statement 5 with the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nGiven Statement 5's condition, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, and vice versa. But both cannot be true. If Statement 3 is true, it makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 false. Statement 6 and Statement 7's truth values depend on the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 11: Assess the number of true statements based on Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since there are 7 statements.\n\n## Step 12: Assess the number of false statements based on Statement 7\nStatement 7 states 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite could be 4 or 6, because these are the composite numbers less than 7.\n\n## Step 13: Combine the information from all statements to find possible solutions\nLet's check the scenarios:\n- If all statements are true (Statement 1 is true), then Statement 4 is false, which is a contradiction because Statement 4 says all statements are false. So, not all can be true.\n- Statement 3 being true implies all others are false, which makes Statement 5 false. This is a possible configuration because it satisfies Statement 3 being the only true statement.\n- For Statement 2 to be true with at most 1 false statement, if there's exactly 1 false statement, it could be any one of the statements. We need to check which one being false makes the others true.\n\n## Step 14: Check for configurations that satisfy multiple statements\nLet's directly analyze potential configurations:\n1. If Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are false. This makes Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) true because 1 is not considered prime, this creates a contradiction.\n2. Checking for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7), we can have configurations like 2 true and 5 false, 3 true and 4 false, 5 true and 2 false, or 7 true and 0 false.\n\n## Step 15: Evaluate specific configurations\nFor 5 true statements: Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7 can be true. Statement 1 is false because not all 7 are true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. This configuration works because:\n- Statement 2 is true (at most 1 false, but here we have 2 false, so it's not valid).\nLet's directly check feasible configurations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 5 being false contradicts the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, because if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 should be true to satisfy its condition, creating a contradiction.\n\n## Step 8: Examine the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which again leads to a contradiction because Statement 4 cannot be true if all statements are false.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the truthfulness based on Statement 1 and Statement 2\nIf Statement 1 is true, all statements are true. However, this leads to a contradiction with Statement 4. Statement 2 being true allows for at most 1 false statement. If Statement 2 is true and there's exactly 1 false statement, it could potentially satisfy several conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate Statement 5 with the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nGiven Statement 5's condition, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, and vice versa. But both cannot be true. If Statement 3 is true, it makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 false. Statement 6 and Statement 7's truth values depend on the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 11: Assess the number of true statements based on Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since there are 7 statements.\n\n## Step 12: Assess the number of false statements based on Statement 7\nStatement 7 states 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite could be 4 or 6, because these are the composite numbers less than 7.\n\n## Step 13: Combine the information from all statements to find possible solutions\nLet's check the scenarios:\n- If all statements are true (Statement 1 is true), then Statement 4 is false, which is a contradiction because Statement 4 says all statements are false. So, not all can be true.\n- Statement 3 being true implies all others are false, which makes Statement 5 false. This is a possible configuration because it satisfies Statement 3 being the only true statement.\n- For Statement 2 to be true with at most 1 false statement, if there's exactly 1 false statement, it could be any one of the statements. We need to check which one being false makes the others true.\n\n## Step 14: Check for configurations that satisfy multiple statements\nLet's directly analyze potential configurations:\n1. If Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are false. This makes Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) true because 1 is not considered prime, this creates a contradiction.\n2. Checking for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7), we can have configurations like 2 true and 5 false, 3 true and 4 false, 5 true and 2 false, or 7 true and 0 false.\n\n## Step 15: Evaluate specific configurations\nFor 5 true statements: Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7 can be true. Statement 1 is false because not all 7 are true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. This configuration works because:\n- Statement 2 is true (at most 1 false, but here we have 2 false, so it's not valid).\nLet's directly check feasible configurations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

We need to analyze each statement and its implications on the others.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total. If all 7 are true, then Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 6 of the statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for the possibility of 1 false statement among the 7.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it must be the only true statement, making all other statements false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that all statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then it contradicts itself because it claims to be false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but not both. Statement 4 cannot be true because it would be a contradiction (as seen in Step 5). So, if Statement 5 is true, Statement 3 must be true.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all other statements must be false. This means Statement 1 is false (not all statements are true), Statement 2 is false (more than 1 statement is false), Statement 4 is false (not all statements are false), Statement 5 is false (because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and Statement 4 is false, so Statement 5 being false doesn't directly contradict Statement 3 being true), Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 8: Check if Statement 3 being true satisfies all conditions\nIf Statement 3 is true and all others are false, then:\n- Statement 1 is false (correct, because not all statements are true).\n- Statement 2 is false (correct, because more than 1 statement is false).\n- Statement 4 is false (correct, because not all statements are false).\n- Statement 5 is false (this needs examination). If Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 should be true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. However, we've assumed Statement 5 is false, which creates a contradiction.\n\n## Step 9: Resolve the contradiction found in Step 8\nThe assumption that Statement 3 is true leads to a contradiction with Statement 5. So, Statement 3 cannot be true under the condition that satisfies all other statements being false due to the contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.\n\n## Step 11: Examine possible truth values based on Statement 1 and Statement 2\nIf Statement 1 is true, all statements are true. However, this leads to a contradiction because Statement 4 cannot be true. Thus, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the scenario where Statement 2 is true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then at most 1 statement is false. This means 6 or 7 statements are true. If 7 statements are true, it contradicts Statement 4 being true. So, if Statement 2 is true, exactly 6 statements must be true (since Statement 1 cannot be true as per Step 11).\n\n## Step 13: Check the validity of having 6 true statements\nIf 6 statements are true, then Statement 1 is false (because not all 7 are true), and the remaining 6 are true. This implies Statement 2 is true (since at most 1 is false, and here 1 is false), Statement 3 is false (because exactly 1 is not true), Statement 4 is false (because exactly 7 are not false), Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true (because 6 is not a prime number, this is actually false), and Statement 7 is true (because 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 14: Detailed examination of having 6 true statements\nFor 6 true statements: Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 being true implies that Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements (6) is prime, which is false because 6 is not prime. So, having 6 true statements is not valid because it makes Statement 6 false.\n\n## Step 15: Consider other possible distributions of true and false statements\nLet's directly assess the statements for possible solutions:\n- If all statements are true (Statement 1 true), it leads to a contradiction.\n- Having exactly 6 true statements is not valid due to the issues with Statement 6.\n\n## Step 16: Evaluate Statement 5's condition again with other statements\nStatement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. We've established Statement 4 cannot be true. So, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true, but this leads to a contradiction as seen before.\n\n## Step 17: Assess the truthfulness based on prime and composite numbers\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime. For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite.\n\n## Step 18: Final analysis of possible solutions\nLet's check for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7):\n- If there are 2 true statements, 5 false. 2 is prime, and 5 is prime (not composite), so Statement 7 is false.\n- If there are 3 true statements, 4 false. 3 is prime, and 4 is composite. This satisfies both Statement 6 and Statement 7.\n\n## Step 19: Check if 3 true statements satisfy the given conditions\nFor 3 true statements: We need to find a combination where 3 statements are true and 4 are false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nWe are given 7 statements about the truthfulness of the statements themselves. We need to analyze each statement and determine the possible number of true and false statements among them.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total. If all 7 are true, then Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 6 out of the 7 statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for the possibility of 0 or 1 false statement among the 7.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it must be the only true statement, which means all other statements, including Statement 1 and Statement 2, must be false. This creates a contradiction because if Statement 3 is true, Statement 1 and Statement 2 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that all statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then it must be false because it claims all statements are false, including itself.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, and the other must be false. Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (as shown in steps 4 and 5), we examine the implications. If Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 together\nSince Statement 3 being true implies all other statements are false, it contradicts Statement 5 being true because Statement 4 would be false, making Statement 5 true, which is not possible if Statement 3 is the only true statement. Statement 4 being true is also impossible because it claims all statements are false, including itself.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime means it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite could be 4 or 6, because these are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the statements together for consistency\n- If Statement 1 is true, all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4 being true. Thus, not all statements can be true, making Statement 1 false.\n- Statement 2 being true means at most 1 statement is false. If Statement 2 is true, and given that Statement 1 is false, it fits because only Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 3 being true means it's the only true statement, but this contradicts the analysis of other statements, particularly because it would make Statement 5 false, which is consistent, but it doesn't fit with the truthfulness of other statements like Statement 2.\n\n## Step 11: Check for possible solutions based on the analysis\nLet's consider the scenarios:\n1. If Statement 1 is false, then not all statements are true. This is consistent with our initial finding.\n2. Statement 2 being true implies that at most one statement is false. If Statement 1 is the false statement, then Statement 2 is true, and 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 12: Test the scenario where Statement 2 is true and Statement 1 is false\nIf Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, then 6 out of 7 statements are true. Let's check the truthfulness of other statements under this condition.\n- Statement 3 is false because exactly 1 statement is not true (it's 1 false, Statement 1).\n- Statement 4 is false because not all 7 statements are false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, so \"either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\" is false, making Statement 5 false. This is a contradiction because we assumed Statement 5 is one of the true statements.\n- However, re-evaluating: If 6 statements are true (Statement 2 is true, and Statement 1 is false), then Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) is true because 6 is not prime, this creates a contradiction.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check of Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 when Statement 2 is true\nGiven that Statement 2 is true, and thus 6 statements are true (with Statement 1 being false), we have:\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, so it cannot be that \"either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n- Statement 6 is false because 6 (the number of true statements) is not prime.\nThis scenario (6 true statements) makes Statement 5 and Statement 6 false, which contradicts our initial assumption that 6 statements are true because it results in more than 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate the number of true statements based on prime and composite conditions\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6).\n\n## Step 15: Final analysis of possible solutions\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of different numbers of true statements:\n- If 7 statements are true, Statement 1 is true, but this contradicts the falsity required for some statements.\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. This makes Statement 7 false because 2 is not composite. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- Checking other possibilities and statements for consistency.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

However, Statement 4 would also be true, claiming $T = 5$, which contradicts $T = 7$. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true because it creates a contradiction with Statement 4. Therefore, $T \\neq 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 1 and Statement 2\nFrom Statement 1, $T \\geq 3$, and from Statement 2, $T \\geq 4$. Combining these, we get $T \\geq 4$ as the stricter condition.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 5 given that Statement 3 is false\nSince Statement 3 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 4 must be true because it states \"either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\" Thus, $T = 5$ is a potential solution.\n\n## Step 5: Check if $T = 5$ satisfies all conditions\nIf $T = 5$, then:\n- Statement 1 is true because $5 \\geq 3$.\n- Statement 2 is true because $2 \\leq 3$.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because $F = 2$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 6: Verify if $T = 5$ is a valid solution\nFor $T = 5$, Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 3, 7 are false. This gives us $T = 5$ and $F = 2$, satisfying $T = 5$. Let's check the statements again:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: True\n- Statement 7: False\nThis configuration is valid.\n\n## Step 7: Check other possible values of $T$ based on Statement 6\nStatement 6 implies $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. We've established $T = 7$ is not possible and $T = 5$ is a valid solution. Let's examine $T = 2$ and $T = 3$.\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true if $F = 5$, which is not possible since $T = 2$ implies $F = 5$. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. However, we need to check all statements.\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze $T = 3$ as a potential solution\nIf $T = 3$, then $F = 4$. Let's see which statements can be true:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5: Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\nSo, Statements 1, 2, 6, 7 are true, which gives $T = 4$, not $T = 3$. Thus, $T = 3$ is not a valid solution under the given statements.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze $T = 2$ as a potential solution\nFor $T = 2$, $F = 5$. Let's check:\n- Statement 1 is false because $2 < 3$.\n- Statement 2 is false because $5 > 3$.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite.\nWe need exactly 2 true statements. Statement 6 is true. We need one more true statement. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, and Statement 7 is false. So, $T = 2$ is not possible because we can't have exactly 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion on possible solutions\nWe've found that $T = 5$ is a valid solution. Let's summarize the findings:\n- $T = 7$ is not valid.\n- $T = 5$ is valid.\n- $T = 3$ is not valid upon detailed examination.\n- $T = 2$ is not valid.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This is equivalent to saying 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' because if you have 7 statements and at most 3 are false, then at least 4 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims all 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be true because it says exactly 2 statements are false, which would be a contradiction. Thus, Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true. Statement 4 being true means 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (as shown in Step 3), Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. If Statement 3 is true, it leads to a contradiction as explained. So, for Statement 5 to be true and not lead to a contradiction, Statement 4 must be true, and Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Statement 5\nIf Statement 4 is true (meaning 5 statements are true and 2 are false), then Statement 3 is false. This satisfies Statement 5 because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, we have Statement 4 and Statement 5 as potentially true.\n\n## Step 6: Assess the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true. This means Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true. Statement 2 is also true because at least 4 statements are true (since 5 are true). Statement 6 needs to be evaluated: if 5 statements are true, then the number of true statements (5) is prime, so Statement 6 is true. Statement 7: if 2 statements are false, then the number of false statements is not composite (2 is prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 7: Check the consistency of the statements when Statement 4 is true\nWith Statement 4 being true, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false), Statement 6 (True because 5 is prime), and Statement 7 (False because 2 is not composite). So, we have 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which is consistent with Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 8: Verify if this configuration satisfies all conditions\n- Statement 1 is true because 5 out of 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because having 2 false statements means at most 3 are false.\n- Statement 3 is false, as expected.\n- Statement 4 is true, and it correctly states that 2 statements are false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 is not a composite number.\n\n## Step 9: Check for other possible configurations\nLet's directly check the validity of other potential configurations based on the statements given, especially focusing on the constraints provided by Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 for possible true statement counts\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate possible configurations based on prime and composite conditions\n- If the number of true statements is 2 (prime), then the number of false statements is 5 (not composite, so Statement 7 is false). This could be a potential configuration.\n- If the number of true statements is 3 (prime), then the number of false statements is 4 (composite), so Statement 7 is true.\n- If the number of true statements is 5 (prime), we've already found this configuration to be valid.\n- If the number of true statements is 7 (prime), then Statement 3 is true, which leads to a contradiction as previously discussed.\n\n## Step 12: Check the configuration where 3 statements are true\nIf 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. Statement 1 is false because it says at least 3 are true, but it's on the edge. Statement 2 is false because it says at most 3 are false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 could be true or false depending on Statement 3 and 4, but since both are false, it's false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. So, we have Statement 6 and Statement 7 as true, and Statement 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as false. This gives us 2 true statements, not 3, so it's not valid.\n\n## Step 13: Check the configuration where 2 statements are true\nIf 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. This makes Statement 1 false. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite. So, we have 1 true statement (Statement 6), which contradicts our assumption of 2 true statements. Thus, this configuration is not valid.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. If all 7 are true, then Statement 1 is true, which is consistent. However, we need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that the number of false statements is between 0 and 7, inclusive. For 7 statements, this means 0 to 7 false statements are allowed, which translates to 0 to 7 true statements being allowed as well, since the total is 7. Thus, it allows all possibilities from 0 true statements (7 false) to 7 true statements (0 false).\n\n## Step 3: Examine Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true,' and Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 4 being true means exactly 5 statements are true, which is the same condition as Statement 3. Thus, both cannot be true at the same time because they essentially say the same thing.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 5\nStatement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 is false because it is impossible for exactly one of them to be true since they convey the same information.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the Implications of Statement 5 Being False\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we know both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must either be true or false together. However, because they are equivalent, if one is true, the other is true. Thus, they are either both true or both false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4 Being True or False\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then exactly 5 statements are true. If they are false, then the number of true statements is not 5.\n\n## Step 7: Check Consistency with Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 5 being true (since Statement 5 is false), so Statement 1 cannot be true if we are to satisfy the condition that Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the Truthfulness of Statements Based on Statement 1 Being False\nIf Statement 1 is false, then fewer than 7 statements are true. This means at least one statement is false.\n\n## Step 9: Examine the Case When Statement 3 and Statement 4 Are Both False\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not 5. This gives us a range of possibilities (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 true statements) since 5 true statements is not allowed.\n\n## Step 10: Check Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is a number greater than 1 that is not prime.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze Possible Scenarios Based on Statement 6 and Statement 7\nFor 7 statements, the possible numbers of true statements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The prime numbers among these are 2, 3, 5, 7. The number of false statements being composite means it should be 4 or 6 (since 0 and 1 are not composite, and 2 is prime).\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the Number of True Statements Being Prime (Statement 6)\nIf the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, 7), we check: for 2 true, 5 false (5 is prime, 5 is not composite); for 3 true, 4 false (3 is prime, 4 is composite); for 5 true, 2 false (5 is prime, 2 is not composite); for 7 true, 0 false (7 is prime, 0 is not composite).\n\n## Step 13: Check for Consistency Across All Statements\n- For 3 true statements: Statements 3, 4, and 5 are false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true because at most 7 are false. So, we have Statements 2, 6, and 7 as true, which is 3 true statements. This scenario is consistent.\n\n## Step 14: Count the Number of Possible Solutions\nLet's directly check the validity of different numbers of true statements:\n- For 7 true: Statement 1 is true, but Statement 5 is false, so this can't be a solution.\n- For 5 true: Statements 3 and 4 are true, which contradicts Statement 5 being true. So, this scenario is not valid because Statement 5 must be false, making both Statement 3 and Statement 4 false.\n- For 3 true: As analyzed, this is a valid scenario with Statements 2, 6, and 7 being true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Let's analyze them one by one to understand their implications.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. So, it allows for any number of false statements among the 7.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means 5 statements are true, and 2 are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 states 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that exactly 5 statements are true (and thus 2 are false), they are essentially saying the same thing, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false under the condition that they both assert the same number of true statements. Thus, Statement 5 being true would mean that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 states 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 according to this statement.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the implications of Statement 1 being true\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 5 because if all statements are true, then both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, which violates Statement 5. Thus, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 1 being false\nSince Statement 1 is false, not all 7 statements are true. This means at most 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 11: Check the consistency of the statements with the condition that Statement 1 is false\nLet's examine the possible scenarios based on the number of true statements and check for consistency across all statements.\n\n## Step 12: Examine possible numbers of true statements\n- If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. Statement 1 is false, so this is a possible scenario. Statement 2 is true because at most 1 statement is false. Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 5 are true. Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 2 are false. Statement 5 is true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 6 is true because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 1 is not composite. However, Statement 6 being true with 6 true statements is a contradiction because 6 is not prime.\n\n## Step 13: Continue examining possible numbers of true statements\nLet's directly analyze the statements for possible configurations:\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true. If Statement 5 is true, then one of them is false, and the other is true. But they say the same thing, so if Statement 5 is true, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## Step 14: Detailed analysis of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not 5. Statement 5 being true supports this. Let's check other statements.\n\n## Step 15: Checking for the number of true statements when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, we have at least 2 false statements. Statement 5 is true. Let's consider the number of true statements: If 5 statements are not true, and Statement 1 is false, we have to check other possibilities.\n\n## Step 16: Analyzing the case when Statement 5 is true\nStatement 5 being true means both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. So, the number of true statements is not 5. Let's check if there's a configuration that satisfies all conditions.\n\n## Step 17: Checking the number of true statements\nLet's directly check the possible numbers of true statements based on the prime condition (Statement 6) and the composite condition for false statements (Statement 7).\n\n## Step 18: Evaluating Statement 6 and Statement 7 together\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6).\n\n## Step 19: Checking for valid configurations\n- If the number of true statements is 7, Statement 1 is true, which is not possible.\n- If the number of true statements is 5, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, making Statement 5 false. This is a potential configuration but let's check: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (because 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 2 is not composite). So, we have 5 true statements, which satisfies Statement 6 and makes Statement 7 false because 2 is not composite. Thus, this configuration is not valid because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 20: Checking other configurations\nLet's consider the case where the number of true statements is 3 (prime) or 2 (prime), and see if it satisfies all conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

This implies exactly 5 statements are true.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'

Thus, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 is false because it states that exactly one of them is true.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the implications of Statement 5 being false\nWith Statement 5 being false, we have 6 statements left to evaluate. Statement 1 is false, as shown. So, we have 6 statements to consider for truthfulness.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the truthfulness of the remaining statements\nLet's examine the possible scenarios based on the number of true statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true. This would mean Statement 4 is also true because it's equivalent to Statement 3. So, we have at least 2 true statements (3 and 4). Statement 5 is false, so that's 2 true and 1 false so far.\n- For exactly 5 true statements, we need 3 more true statements besides Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the conditions under which exactly 5 statements are true\nFor exactly 5 statements to be true (as per Statement 3 and Statement 4), besides Statements 3 and 4 being true, we need 3 more true statements out of the remaining 4 (1, 2, 5, 6, 7). Statement 5 is false. So, we are left with Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7.\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true because it allows for any number of statements to be true as long as not more than 7 are false, which is always true.\n- Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements is prime. Since 5 is prime, Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is true if the number of false statements is composite. With 2 false statements (1 and 5), Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 7: Check if having exactly 5 true statements satisfies all conditions\nIf Statements 2, 3, 4, and 6 are true, and Statements 1, 5, and 7 are false, we have 4 true statements, not 5. This doesn't satisfy Statement 3 or 4. Let's directly check the validity of having exactly 5 true statements with the correct combination: Statements 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 being true. Here, Statements 1 and 5 are false.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is true because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite, actually making it false. So, this scenario doesn't work because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze other possible numbers of true statements\nLet's directly check the statements for other possible numbers of true statements that satisfy the prime condition (Statement 6) and see if they can be valid.\n- For 7 true statements, we've established it's not possible due to Statement 5 being false.\n- For 5 true statements, we've seen it's challenging due to the conditions imposed by other statements.\n- For 3 true statements (a prime number), Statement 6 is satisfied. Let's see if there's a combination that works.\n- For 2 true statements (a prime number), Statement 6 is satisfied.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the scenario for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements more deeply\nLet's directly assess the feasibility:\n- For 2 true statements: Statement 6 is true. Possible combinations need to be checked. If Statement 6 is one of the true statements, the other true statement could be Statement 2 because it's always true in a broad sense. However, we need to check if there's a valid combination.\n\n## Step 10: Checking for valid combinations\nLet's consider the case where Statement 6 is true, implying the number of true statements is prime.\n- If 2 statements are true, and one of them is Statement 6, the other could be Statement 2. This gives us 5 false statements, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. This is a possible scenario.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze the given statements and understand their implications on the number of true and false statements among them.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total. If all 7 are true, then the number of true statements is 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 5 statements must be true because 7 - 2 = 5. So, the number of true statements is 5 or more.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states that 4 statements are true and 3 are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 2 statements are true and 5 are false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. Statement 3 being true means 4 statements are true, and Statement 4 being true means 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 according to this statement.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements can range from 0 to 7. The composite numbers in this range are 4 and 6. So, the number of false statements being composite means it is either 4 or 6, implying the number of true statements is either 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the statements\nLet's examine the possible scenarios based on the statements:\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 4 and Statement 7 because if all 7 are true, then 0 are false, and 0 is not composite.\n- Statement 2 being true means at least 5 statements are true. If exactly 5 are true, it satisfies Statement 6 because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 3 being true means 4 statements are true. This does not satisfy Statement 6 because 4 is not prime.\n- Statement 4 being true means 2 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 6 because 2 is prime.\n\n## Step 10: Check for consistency among statements\nLet's check the consistency:\n- If Statement 1 is true, all statements are true. But this makes Statement 4 and Statement 7 false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not composite. So, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true due to Statement 5. If Statement 3 is true (4 true statements), Statement 4 is false. If Statement 4 is true (2 true statements), Statement 3 is false.\n- For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but not both. Let's examine both cases.\n\n## Step 11: Examine the case when Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 4 statements are true. This makes Statement 6 false because 4 is not prime. So, we have at least one false statement (Statement 6), and Statement 1 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 2 could be true or false depending on the number of false statements. With 4 true statements, 3 are false, which makes Statement 7 potentially true if 3 were composite, but 3 is not composite. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. So, we have: Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), and potentially others. Let's count: if 4 are true, then Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are false. Statement 2 is true because 3 false statements are less than or equal to 2 is false, but it's actually true because 3 is less than or equal to the maximum of 2 false statements is not true, it's false. So, we have Statement 3 (True), Statement 5 (True), and potentially Statement 2 (False), Statement 1 (False), Statement 4 (False), Statement 6 (False), Statement 7 (False). This gives us 2 true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 5), which contradicts our initial assumption of 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 12: Examine the case when Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true. This means Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. So, we have at least two true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 6). Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 7 is true if the number of false statements (5) is composite. 5 is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false. Statement 1 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 2 is false because more than 2 statements are false. Statement 3 is false as per our assumption. So, we have: Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True), and the rest are false. This gives us 3 true statements, which contradicts our assumption that exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 13: Re-evaluate the statements for possible solutions\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements that satisfy the given conditions and count the solutions.\n\n## Step 14: Checking the number of true statements\nFor 7 statements:\n- If 7 are true, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are examined. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true (7 is prime), but Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite), so this scenario is not valid.\n- If 5 are true, Statement 2 is true, and Statement 6 is true (5 is prime). Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. This is a potential scenario.\n- If 4 are true, Statement 3 is true, but Statement 6 is false. This could be a potential scenario if it satisfies other conditions.\n- If 3 are true, Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). This is a potential scenario.\n- If 2 are true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 6 is true (2 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (5 is not composite). Statement 5 is true if Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. So, we have a potential set: Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 being true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements can range from 0 to 7.

If Statement 4 is true (2 true statements), Statement 3 is false.\n- For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but not both. Let's examine both cases.\n\n## Step 11: Examine the case when Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 4 statements are true. This makes Statement 6 false because 4 is not prime. So, we have at least one false statement (Statement 6), and Statement 1 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 2 could be true or false depending on the number of false statements. With 4 true statements, 3 are false, which makes Statement 7 potentially true if 3 were composite, but 3 is not composite. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. So, we have: Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), and potentially others. Let's count: if 4 are true, then Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are false. Statement 2 is true because 3 false statements are less than or equal to 2 is false, but it's actually true because 3 is less than or equal to the maximum of 2 false statements is not true, it's false. So, we have Statement 3 (True), Statement 5 (True), and potentially Statement 2 (False), Statement 1 (False), Statement 4 (False), Statement 6 (False), Statement 7 (False). This gives us 2 true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 5), which contradicts our initial assumption of 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 12: Examine the case when Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true. This means Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. So, we have at least two true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 6). Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 7 is true if the number of false statements (5) is composite. 5 is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false. Statement 1 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 2 is false because more than 2 statements are false. Statement 3 is false as per our assumption. So, we have: Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True), and the rest are false.

Let's denote the number of true statements as $T$ and the number of false statements as $F$. Thus, $T + F = 7$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies $T \\geq 7$. Since $T$ cannot be more than 7, $T = 7$. This means all statements must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F \\leq 2$, or $T \\geq 5$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'

However, this contradicts Statements 3 and 4 because they cannot both be true. Statement 5's truthfulness depends on exactly one of Statements 3 or 4 being true, but if all statements are true, then Statement 5 is false because both Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the truthfulness of each statement based on the conditions given\n- If Statement 1 is true, then $T = 7$. This makes Statement 2 true ($T = 7 \\geq 5$), Statement 3 false ($T \\neq 4$), Statement 4 false ($T \\neq 2$), Statement 5 false (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 true ($T = 7$ is prime), and Statement 7 true ($F = 0$ is not composite, it's a special case but generally considered not composite).

Let's examine possible values of $T$ that satisfy multiple statements.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze possible values of $T$ based on given statements\n- For $T = 7$, Statements 3, 4, and 5 are false. This gives us 4 false statements, not satisfying $T = 7$ because Statement 5 is false.\n- Let's directly analyze the statements:\n- Statement 1: $T = 7$.\n- Statement 2: $T \\geq 5$.\n- Statement 3: $T = 4$.\n- Statement 4: $T = 2$.\n- Statement 5: Either $T = 4$ or $T = 2$ but not both.\n- Statement 6: $T$ is prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7: $F$ is composite.\n\n## Step 11: Check for $T$ that satisfies multiple conditions\nLet's examine $T = 7$: It satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6. However, it doesn't satisfy Statements 3, 4, and 5. Statement 7 is false because $F = 0$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the number of true statements based on the prime condition (Statement 6)\n$T$ can be 2, 3, 5, or 7 for Statement 6 to be true.\n\n## Step 13: Check each possible $T$ for consistency across statements\n- For $T = 2$, Statements 1, 2, 3, 6 are false. Statement 4 is true, Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3 being false and Statement 4 being true, so it's true. Statement 7 is true because $F = 5$ is not composite but Statement 7 says $F$ is composite, so it's false. Thus, $T = 2$ ( Statements 4, 5 are true) doesn't satisfy all conditions directly but let's check: Statements 4 and 5 are true, and Statement 7 is false. $T = 2$ means Statements 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 are false. So, we have $T = 2$, which is a potential solution.\n\n## Step 14: Detailed check for $T = 2$\nFor $T = 2$, Statements 4 and 5 are true. This gives us $T = 2$. Let's verify: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true (because 2 is prime), and Statement 7 is false.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true, and it satisfies its own condition. However, we need to check other statements as well.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 5 of the 7 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for 0, 1, or 2 false statements among the 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then 4 statements are true, and 3 are false. This directly contradicts Statement 1 because if 3 statements are false, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 2 statements are true, and 5 are false. If Statement 4 is true, then it is one of the 2 true statements, which implies that Statement 3 must be false because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. This statement's truthfulness depends on the truth values of Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the Possibility of All Statements Being True (Statement 1's Condition)\nIf all 7 statements are true (as per Statement 1), then:\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 2 (actually 0) statements are false.\n- Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 4 are true, not 7.\n- Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 5 are false, not 0.\n- Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and both are false, so it is actually false.\nSince Statement 5 is false under the condition that all statements are true, the scenario where all 7 statements are true is not possible.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate Statement 2 Being True\nIf Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true. Let's examine the possible distributions:\n- If 5 statements are true, then Statements 1, 3, and 4 cannot all be true because they contradict each other. Statement 1 cannot be true if exactly 5 are true.\n\n## Step 8: Check for Consistency Across Statements\nLet's directly analyze the statements for possible true statement counts:\n- Statement 1 being true requires all 7 to be true, which we've found to be inconsistent.\n- Statement 3 being true means 4 are true. Let's check if this can be valid.\n- Statement 4 being true means 2 are true. This is another possibility.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed Check for 4 True Statements (Statement 3)\nIf 4 statements are true:\n- Statement 1 is false because not all 7 are true.\n- Statement 2 could be true if there are 3 false statements, which is possible.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false because exactly 5 are not false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 needs to be checked: 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7: 3 false statements, and 3 is not a composite number (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\nSo, we have Statements 2, 3, 5 as true, and Statements 1, 4, 6, 7 as false, which gives us 3 true statements, not 4. Thus, this scenario doesn't satisfy Statement 3.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed Check for 2 True Statements (Statement 4)\nIf 2 statements are true:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is false because more than 2 statements are false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5: Since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6: 2 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7: 5 false statements, and 5 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\nHere, Statements 4, 5, and 6 are true, which gives us 3 true statements, not 2. So, this scenario doesn't satisfy Statement 4.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for Other Possible Combinations\nLet's directly check the validity of different numbers of true statements:\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite). So, Statements 2, 5, 6 are true, which is 3 true statements. This doesn't match.\n- For 6 true statements: Statement 1 is true (but we've established this leads to a contradiction), Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is false (6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true. So, Statements 1, 2, 5, 7 are true, which is 4 true statements.

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nWe have 7 statements regarding the truthfulness of the statements themselves. We need to analyze each statement and determine the possible number of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.' This means the number of true statements (T) is $T \\geq 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that $T \\geq 6$ because if at most 1 statement is false, then at least 6 statements must be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' This means $T = 6$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T = 5$ because if 2 statements are false, then 5 are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This means that either $T = 6$ or $T = 5$, but not both. So, it's either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The number of false statements is $7 - T$. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $7 - T = 4$ or $7 - T = 6$, meaning $T = 3$ or $T = 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the conditions together\nFrom Step 3, $T \\geq 6$. This satisfies Statement 1 ($T \\geq 3$) and is consistent with Statement 3 ($T = 6$) being true.\n\n## Step 10: Check consistency of Statement 2 and Statement 3\nIf Statement 3 is true ($T = 6$), then Statement 2 is also true because $T = 6$ means only 1 statement is false, satisfying 'at most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n\n## Step 11: Examine the truthfulness based on Statement 3 being true\nIf $T = 6$, then Statement 4 is false. Statement 5's truthfulness depends on Statement 3 being true and Statement 4 being false, which makes Statement 5 true. So, we have Statement 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and potentially Statement 7 being true or false. $T = 6$ makes Statement 6 ($T$ is prime) false because 6 is not prime. Thus, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 must be false.\n\n## Step 12: Check if $T = 6$ is a valid solution\nIf $T = 6$, then the false statement must be Statement 6 (since $T = 6$ is not prime). The statements that are true are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7. Statement 7 is true because $7 - T = 1$, which is not composite, so this creates a problem. Let's correct the analysis: If $T = 6$, then Statement 4 is false. The false statement could be Statement 4 or Statement 6. But if Statement 6 is false, it means $T$ is not prime, which is true for $T = 6$. Statement 7 is false because $7 - 6 = 1$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check for $T = 6$\n- Statement 1 is true because $T = 6 \\geq 3$.\n- Statement 2 is true because $7 - T = 1$, which is at most 1.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite.\nSo, $T = 5$ ( Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 are not all true or false together under $T = 6$), let's directly check the validity.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate $T = 5$ based on Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, $T = 5$. Then, Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and here Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 15: Check the validity of $T = 5$\nFor $T = 5$, the statements that could be true are 1, 4, 5, 6, and potentially others. Statement 2 is false because $T = 5$ means 2 statements are false, which is more than 1. Statement 3 is false. Statement 7 is true because $7 - T = 2$, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is actually false.\n\n## Step 16: Detailed check for $T = 5$\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\nSo, we have Statements 1, 4, 5, 6 as true, which gives $T = 4$, not 5. This is inconsistent.\n\n## Step 17: Conclusion on possible solutions\nLet's directly check the possible values of $T$ that satisfy all given conditions and count the number of valid solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $7 - T = 4$ or $7 - T = 6$, meaning $T = 3$ or $T = 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the conditions together\nFrom Step 3, $T \\geq 6$.

Statement 5's truthfulness depends on Statement 3 being true and Statement 4 being false, which makes Statement 5 true. So, we have Statement 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and potentially Statement 7 being true or false. $T = 6$ makes Statement 6 ($T$ is prime) false because 6 is not prime. Thus, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 must be false.\n\n## Step 12: Check if $T = 6$ is a valid solution\nIf $T = 6$, then the false statement must be Statement 6 (since $T = 6$ is not prime). The statements that are true are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7. Statement 7 is true because $7 - T = 1$, which is not composite, so this creates a problem. Let's correct the analysis: If $T = 6$, then Statement 4 is false. The false statement could be Statement 4 or Statement 6. But if Statement 6 is false, it means $T$ is not prime, which is true for $T = 6$. Statement 7 is false because $7 - 6 = 1$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check for $T = 6$\n- Statement 1 is true because $T = 6 \\geq 3$.\n- Statement 2 is true because $7 - T = 1$, which is at most 1.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite.\nSo, $T = 5$ ( Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 are not all true or false together under $T = 6$), let's directly check the validity.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate $T = 5$ based on Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, $T = 5$. Then, Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and here Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 15: Check the validity of $T = 5$\nFor $T = 5$, the statements that could be true are 1, 4, 5, 6, and potentially others.

We have 7 statements, and we need to determine the number of possible solutions based on their truthfulness.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says, 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.' This means the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 3. So, $T \\geq 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says, 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 1. Since there are 7 statements, $T + F = 7$, so $T \\geq 6$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says, 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' This means $T = 6$ and $F = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says, 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T = 5$ and $F = 2$.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says, 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. This statement can be true only if one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says, 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The possible values for $T$ that are prime and less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says, 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For $F$, the composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the statements\nLet's examine the possible scenarios based on the constraints given by the statements.\n\n- If Statement 3 is true ($T = 6$), then Statement 4 is false. Statement 2 is true because $F = 1$. Statement 1 is true because $T = 6 \\geq 3$. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is false because $T = 6$ is not prime. Statement 7 is false because $F = 1$ is not composite. So, we have $T = 4$ ( Statements 1, 2, 3, 5 are true), which contradicts $T = 6$. Thus, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true ($T = 5$), then Statement 3 is false. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false because $F = 2$. Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is true because $T = 5$ is prime. Statement 7 is false because $F = 2$ is not composite (2 is prime). So, we have Statements 1, 4, 5, 6 as true, which gives $T = 4$, contradicting $T = 5$. Thus, this scenario is also not possible.\n\n## Step 10: Check the consistency of the statements with possible values of T\nLet's directly check the possible values of $T$ and see which statements can be true.\n\n- For $T = 7$, Statements 1, 2, 3, 6 are true. Statement 7 is false because $F = 0$ is not composite. Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. So, $T = 5$ ( Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 are true), which is not consistent with $T = 7$.\n- For $T = 6$, we've already seen it's not possible.\n- For $T = 5$, we've seen it's not possible.\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both; however, both are false, so Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 4$ is composite. So, Statements 1, 6, 7 are true, giving $T = 3$, which is consistent.\n\n## Step 11: Verify the consistency for T = 3\nFor $T = 3$, we have Statements 1, 6, 7 as true. This gives $T = 3$, which is a valid solution because it satisfies the conditions of being at least 3 true (Statement 1), having a prime number of true statements (Statement 6), and having a composite number of false statements (Statement 7).\n\n## Step 12: Check for other possible values of T\nLet's check other possible prime values for $T$ like 2.\n\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false. This scenario is not valid because Statement 1 being false implies $T < 3$, which is true, but we need to check all statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This statement implies that we cannot have both $T = 6$ and $T = 5$ being true, which is inherently true.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the Implications of Statements 3 and 4 Being True or False\nIf Statement 3 is true ($T = 6$), then Statement 4 is false. For $T = 6$, Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 need to be examined for consistency. Statement 1 is true because $T = 6 \\geq 3$. Statement 2 is true because $F = 1 \\leq 1$. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is false, making Statement 3 true exclusively. Statement 6 is true if $T = 6$ is prime; 6 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 is true if $F = 1$ is composite; 1 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.

For $T = 5$, we check the truthfulness of other statements. Statement 1 is true because $T = 5 \\geq 3$. Statement 2 is false because $F = 2 > 1$. Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and Statement 4 is true while Statement 3 is false.

So, we have Statements 1, 4, 5, 6 as true, and Statements 2, 3, 7 as false, giving $T = 4$, which contradicts $T = 5$.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. For $T = 5$, $T$ is prime, so this statement is true. For $T = 6$, $T$ is not prime, so this statement is false.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. For $T = 5$, $F = 2$, and 2 is not composite. For $T = 6$, $F = 1$, and 1 is not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Check for Consistency Across All Statements for $T = 5$ and $T = 6$\nFor $T = 6$: Statements 1, 2, 3, 5 are true. Statement 6 and 7 are false because 6 is not prime and 1 is not composite, respectively. Statement 4 is false because $T \\neq 5$. So, we have 4 true statements, which contradicts $T = 6$.\n\nFor $T = 5$: Statements 1, 4, 5, 6 are true. Statements 2, 3, 7 are false. So, $T = 4$, which again contradicts $T = 5$.\n\n## Step 11: Consider Other Possible Values of $T$ Based on Initial Statements\nLet's directly check the validity of each statement for different $T$.\n\n- For $T = 3$: Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false because $F = 4 > 1$. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because both 3 and 4 are false. Statement 6 is true if 3 is prime; 3 is prime.

Statements 1, 5, 6, 7 being true is a valid configuration because it satisfies $T = 4$. Statement 1 is true. Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is true because 4 is not prime, but if we consider the statements that can be true, we need to adjust our understanding.

Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This is equivalent to saying 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' because if you have 7 statements and at most 5 are false, then at least 2 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies 2 are false. Statement 4 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies 5 are true. Thus, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent in terms of the number of true and false statements they imply.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 5 given Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5, which says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both,' must be false because it is impossible for one to be true and the other false if they are equivalent.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the implications of Statement 5 being false\nWith Statement 5 being false, we now have 1 false statement so far. Let's denote the number of true statements as T and the number of false statements as F. So, T + F = 7.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the truthfulness based on Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent and imply 5 true statements and 2 false statements, let's check if this satisfies all conditions. If T = 5 and F = 2, then Statement 1 is true because at least 5 statements are true. Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number; 5 is prime, so Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite; 2 is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 7: Check if T = 5 and F = 2 satisfy all statements\n- Statement 1: True (5 true statements)\n- Statement 2: True (2 false statements mean at least 2 are true, and 5 false statements is not true, but at most 5 false is true)\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: False (as determined)\n- Statement 6: True (5 is prime)\n- Statement 7: False (2 is not composite)\n\nThis gives us T = 5 and F = 2. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true because having 2 false statements satisfies 'at least 2 true', Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. So, we have 5 true and 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 8: Verify if the solution satisfies the condition of Statement 2\nStatement 2 is 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false,' which is true when F \u2264 5. Here, F = 2, so Statement 2 is true.\n\n## Step 9: Check for other possible configurations\nLet's check other possible values for T and F that could satisfy the given conditions, especially focusing on the constraints provided by the statements.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 for possible T and F\nFor T to be prime (Statement 6), T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For F to be composite (Statement 7), F could be 4, 6. So, possible configurations based on Statement 6 are T = 2, 3, 5, 7, and based on Statement 7 are F = 4, 6, implying T = 3, 1.\n\n## Step 11: Cross-check the possible configurations\n- For T = 2 (F = 5), Statement 1 is false, Statement 6 is true (2 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (5 is not composite). This doesn't satisfy Statement 1.\n- For T = 3 (F = 4), Statement 1 is false, Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite).

Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This is equivalent to saying 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' because if you have 7 statements and at most 5 are false, then at least 2 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies 2 are false. Statement 4 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies 5 are true. Thus, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent in terms of the number of true and false statements they imply.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 5 given Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5, which says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both,' must be false because it is impossible for one to be true and the other false if they are equivalent.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the implications of Statement 5 being false\nWith Statement 5 being false, we now have 1 false statement so far. Let's denote the number of true statements as T and the number of false statements as F. So, T + F = 7.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the truthfulness based on Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent and imply 5 true statements and 2 false statements, let's check if this satisfies all conditions. If T = 5 and F = 2, then Statement 1 is true because at least 5 statements are true. Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number; 5 is prime, so Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite; 2 is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 7: Check if T = 5 and F = 2 satisfy all statements\n- Statement 1: True (5 true statements)\n- Statement 2: True (2 false statements mean at least 2 are true, and 5 false statements is not true, but at most 5 false is true)\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: False (as determined)\n- Statement 6: True (5 is prime)\n- Statement 7: False (2 is not composite)\n\nThis gives us T = 5 and F = 2. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true because having 2 false statements satisfies 'at least 2 true', Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. So, we have 5 true and 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 8: Verify if the solution satisfies the condition of Statement 2\nStatement 2 is 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false,' which is true when F \u2264 5. Here, F = 2, so Statement 2 is true.\n\n## Step 9: Check for other possible configurations\nLet's check other possible values for T and F that could satisfy the given conditions, especially focusing on the constraints provided by the statements.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 for possible T and F\nFor T to be prime (Statement 6), T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For F to be composite (Statement 7), F could be 4, 6. So, possible configurations based on Statement 6 are T = 2, 3, 5, 7, and based on Statement 7 are F = 4, 6, implying T = 3, 1.\n\n## Step 11: Cross-check the possible configurations\n- For T = 2 (F = 5), Statement 1 is false, Statement 6 is true (2 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (5 is not composite). This doesn't satisfy Statement 1.\n- For T = 3 (F = 4), Statement 1 is false, Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). Statement 2 is true because F = 4 is less than or equal to 5.\n- For T = 5 (F = 2), we've already verified this configuration.\n- For T = 7 (F = 0), Statement 7 is false because 0 is not composite.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed check for T = 3\nIf T = 3, then Statement 1 is false (since not at least 5 are true), Statement 2 is true (since at least 2 are true, and F = 4 is at most 5), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, it satisfies the condition of being true), Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true. So, we have 3 true (Statements 2, 6, 7) and 4 false (Statements 1, 3, 4, 5), which matches T = 3.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' We need to understand that Statement 2 is equivalent to saying 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true' because if at most 5 are false, then at least 2 must be true.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 implies that at least 2 statements are true. This is because if 5 or fewer statements are false, then 2 or more must be true out of the 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says exactly 5 statements are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 2 statements are false (which means 5 statements are true). Both Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing: that 5 out of 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 5\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both') must be false because it is impossible for only one of them to be true since they convey the same information.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the implications of Statement 5 being false\nSince Statement 5 is false, we now know that either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false. However, they cannot both be false because if 5 statements are not true, then Statement 1 would be false, and we need to check the consistency of other statements.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the truthfulness of Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then exactly 5 statements are true. This means Statement 1 is also true because at least 5 statements are true. So, we have at least 3 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4).\n\n## Step 7: Check the consistency when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then 5 statements are true. This implies Statement 1 is true. Statement 5 is false (as established). For 5 statements to be true, Statement 6 and Statement 7 must also be examined. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Since 5 is prime, Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. With 2 false statements, Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Verify the number of true and false statements when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true\nWe have Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6 as true (4 so far), and Statement 5 is false. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. So, we have 4 true statements and 3 false statements so far, which doesn't satisfy Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true. This indicates a potential inconsistency.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate the statements for consistency\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements. If 5 statements are true (as per Statement 3 and Statement 4), then Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6 are true. Statement 2 is also true because at least 2 statements are true. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6 as true, which gives us 5 true statements. Statement 5 is false, and Statement 7 is false. This scenario is consistent with Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 10: Check for other possible solutions\nLet's analyze other possibilities based on the number of true statements. If Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not 5. We need to check other possibilities.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the case when the number of true statements is not 5\nIf the number of true statements is not 5, then we have to check the validity of other statements. For instance, if 2 statements are true, Statement 1 is false. We need to check if this setup can satisfy all given conditions.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the prime and composite conditions\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 13: Check for the number of true statements being prime\nLet's directly examine the possibilities: If 2 statements are true, Statement 6 is true, but Statement 1 is false. If 3 statements are true, Statement 6 is true. If 5 statements are true, we've already seen it's a possible scenario. If 7 statements are true, then Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6 are true, but Statement 5 is false, and Statement 7 is false because 0 is not composite.\n\n## Step 14: Final evaluation of possible solutions\nLet's directly check the scenarios: (1) 5 true statements: We've seen this is a valid scenario. (2) Other scenarios need to be checked for consistency across all statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This is equivalent to saying 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' because if you have 7 statements and at most 5 are false, then at least 2 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true,' which implies 2 are false. Statement 4 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false,' which implies 5 are true. Both statements essentially say the same thing: 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the implications of Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' However, from Step 3, we see that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, so they are either both true or both false. This means Statement 5 must be false because it claims only one of them can be true.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the truth value of Statement 3 and Statement 4 based on Statement 5\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must be true or both false. But since they are equivalent, if one is true, the other is true, and if one is false, the other is false.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the scenario when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then exactly 5 statements are true. This would mean Statement 1 is true because at least 5 statements are true. Statement 2 is also true because at most 5 statements are false (which means at least 2 are true). Statement 5 is false, as determined. Statement 6: If 5 statements are true, then the number of true statements (5) is prime, so Statement 6 is true. Statement 7: If 2 statements are false, then the number of false statements (2) is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false. So, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (True), Statement 7 (False). This gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which matches Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n## Step 7: Check if the scenario in Step 6 is consistent with all statements\nLet's count the true statements: Statement 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are true. That's 5 true statements. The false statements are Statement 5 and Statement 7, which are 2. This scenario is consistent with Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 being true.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the scenario when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then it's not the case that exactly 5 statements are true. Statement 1 could still be true if at least 5 statements are true, but since Statement 3 is false, we can't have exactly 5 true statements. Let's examine the possibilities: If Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 is false because it requires one of them to be true and the other false. So, we have at least 2 false statements (Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5).\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the number of true statements when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nWith Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false, we have at least 3 false statements. Let's check the statements: Statement 1 (At least 5 true), Statement 2 (At least 2 true), Statement 6 (Number of true statements is prime), and Statement 7 (Number of false statements is composite). If we have 3 or more false statements, Statement 1 might be false because it requires at least 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Examine possible distributions of true and false statements when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nLet's consider the number of true statements: If we have 4 true statements, Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is true because at least 2 statements are true (4 are true). Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is true if the number of false statements is composite; with 3 false statements, it's true because 3 is not composite, it's prime. So, having 4 true statements gives us: Statement 1 (False), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (False), Statement 7 (False). This gives 1 true statement, which contradicts our assumption of 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 11: Continue examining distributions\nFor 3 true statements: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true (because 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 4 is composite). So, we have: Statement 1 (False), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (True), Statement 7 (True). This gives 3 true statements, which is consistent.\n\n## Step 12: Count the number of possible solutions\nWe have found two possible consistent scenarios: one with 5 true statements and one with 3 true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 2, 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false,' is also satisfied because 0 statements are false, which is less than 4. Statement 3, 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true,' cannot be true if Statement 4 is true because it contradicts the condition that all statements are true. Thus, if Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 3: Check the Consistency of Statements When Statement 4 is True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is true. Statement 6, 'The number of true statements is a prime number,' would be true because 7 is a prime number (all statements being true). Statement 7, 'The number of false statements is a composite number,' would be false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not considered a composite number. So, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True), and Statement 7 (False). This gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Verify if the Scenario Where Statement 4 is True is Valid\nLet's check the statements again with Statement 4 being true: Statement 1 is true (7 true statements), Statement 2 is true (0 false statements is at most 4), Statement 3 is false (not 5 true), Statement 4 is true (0 false), Statement 5 is true (Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false), Statement 6 is true (7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite).

If Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true, and 2 are false.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate Statement 5 Given Statement 3 is True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false because Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, we have Statement 3 (True) and Statement 4 (False).\n\n## Step 7: Check the Implications of Statement 3 Being True on Other Statements\nWith Statement 3 being true and Statement 4 being false, we need to check other statements. Statement 1 is true because at least 4 statements are true (we have 5 true statements). Statement 2 is true because at most 4 statements are false (we have 2 false statements). Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 needs to be evaluated; if 5 statements are true, then the number of true statements (5) is prime, so Statement 6 is true. Statement 7, with 2 false statements, is false because 2 is not a composite number (it's a prime number).\n\n## Step 8: Verify the Consistency of Statements When Statement 3 is True\nLet's count the true statements: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True), and Statement 7 (False). This gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which is consistent with Statement 3 being true.\n\n## Step 9: Check Other Possible Combinations\nLet's directly evaluate the truthfulness based on the number of true statements. If Statement 3 is true, we have a valid solution. We need to check other statements for alternative solutions.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime, and Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, 7. Possible composite numbers of false statements are 4, 6.\n\n## Step 11: Examine Possible Scenarios Based on Statement 6 and Statement 7\n- If 7 statements are true (Statement 4 is true), it's not valid as shown earlier.\n- If 5 statements are true, it's a valid scenario as shown with Statement 3 being true.\n- If 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. Statement 1 is false (not at least 4 true), Statement 2 is true (at most 4 false), Statement 3 is false (not exactly 5 true), Statement 4 is false (not 0 false), Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, but it requires exactly one to be true), Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). This gives 3 true (Statements 2, 6, 7) and 4 false, which doesn't fit because Statement 5 is true, making it 4 true statements, not 3.\n- If 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. This makes Statement 1 false, Statement 2 false, Statement 3 false, Statement 4 false, Statement 5 false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 true (2 is prime), and Statement 7 false (5 is not composite). So, only Statement 6 is true, giving 1 true statement, not 2.\n\n## Step 12: Summarize Findings\nWe have found one valid solution where Statement 3 is true, resulting in 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the statements\nLet's simplify the statements. Statement 1 implies that the number of true statements (T) is \u2265 4. Statement 2 implies that T \u2265 3 (since at most 4 are false means at least 3 are true). Statement 3 implies T = 5. Statement 4 implies T = 7. Statement 5 implies that either T = 5 or T = 7, but not both. Statement 6 implies T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 implies that the number of false statements (F = 7 - T) is a composite number (4, 6).\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 4 and its implications\nStatement 4 says T = 7. If T = 7, then all statements are true. Checking: Statement 1 is true (7 \u2265 4), Statement 2 is true (F = 0, so at most 4 are false), Statement 3 is false (T \u2260 5), Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true at the same time, Statement 6 is true (7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite). Since Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 7 are not all true, T = 7 is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the validity of Statement 3\nStatement 3 says T = 5. If T = 5, then F = 2. Checking the statements: Statement 1 is true (5 \u2265 4), Statement 2 is true (F = 2, so at most 4 are false), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite). Here, Statement 4 and Statement 7 are false, which fits. So, we need to check if this configuration is valid.\n\n## Step 5: Check the configuration for T = 5\nFor T = 5, Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are true, and Statements 4 and 7 are false. This gives us 5 true statements, satisfying Statement 3. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. This configuration is valid.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5's implication further\nStatement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. We've already seen that if Statement 4 is true, it's not a valid solution. So, for Statement 5 to be true and Statement 4 to be false, Statement 3 must be true, which aligns with our T = 5 scenario.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate other potential values of T based on Statement 6\nStatement 6 says T is prime. Possible values for T are 2, 3, 5, 7. We've already examined T = 7 and T = 5. For T = 3, Statement 1 is true (3 is not \u2265 4, so it's false), Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). So, Statements 2, 6, and 7 are true. This gives T = 3, which is a potential solution.\n\n## Step 8: Check the configuration for T = 3\nFor T = 3, let's assume Statements 2, 6, and 7 are true. Then, Statement 1 is false (since 3 < 4), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is false. This configuration is: Statement 1 (F), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (F), Statement 4 (F), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (T), which indeed gives T = 3. Statement 1 being false is consistent with T = 3. This is a valid configuration.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate T = 2\nFor T = 2, Statement 1 is false (2 < 4), Statement 2 is true (since F = 5, which is more than 4), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (2 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (5 is not composite, it's a mistake, 5 is prime). So, Statements 2, 6 are true, and Statement 7 is false because 5 is prime, not composite. This gives us T = 2 ( Statements 2 and 6 are true). Let's correct the assessment: For T = 2, if Statements 2 and 6 are true, then Statement 7 is false because F = 5, and 5 is prime. So, a possible configuration could be Statements 1 (F), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (F), Statement 4 (F), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (F), giving T = 2.\n\n## Step 10: Summarize the valid configurations\nWe have found valid configurations for T = 5 and T = 3. Let's verify if these satisfy all given conditions again and count them.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false,' which means all 7 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then all other statements must also be true.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the Truthfulness of Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, then according to Statement 1, 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true,' which is satisfied because all 7 are true. Statement 2, 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false,' is also satisfied because 0 statements are false, which is less than 4. Statement 3, 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true,' cannot be true if Statement 4 is true because it contradicts the condition that all 7 statements are true. Thus, if Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false. Statement 5, 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both,' would be true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 6, 'The number of true statements is a prime number,' would be false because 7 is not a prime number (it's not considered prime, but actually, 7 is a prime number). Statement 7, 'The number of false statements is a composite number,' would be false because 0 is not considered a composite number. So, if Statement 4 is true, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True because 7 is prime), and Statement 7 (False). This gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 3: Check the Consistency of Statement 4 Being True\nLet's check the consistency: Statement 1 is True (at least 4 are true), Statement 2 is True (at most 4 are false, and 2 are false), Statement 3 is False (not exactly 5 true), Statement 4 is True (0 are false, which is not the case), Statement 5 is True (either Statement 3 or 4 is true but not both), Statement 6 is True (7 is prime), and Statement 7 is False (0 is not composite). So, we actually have 5 true statements (1, 2, 4, 5, 6) and 2 false statements (3, 7), which matches the count. However, Statement 4 being true implies all statements are true, which is not the case here. Thus, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3 and Its Implications\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 5, 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both,' implies Statement 4 must be false because Statement 3 is true. This aligns with our finding in Step 3 that Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the Possibility of Exactly 5 True Statements\nIf exactly 5 statements are true, and Statement 3 is one of them, then Statement 4 must be false. Let's examine the statements: If Statement 3 is true, and there are exactly 5 true statements, then Statement 1 (at least 4 true) is true, Statement 2 (at most 4 false) is true because 2 are false, Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, and Statement 6 or Statement 7 must be one of the true statements along with Statement 3, Statement 1, and Statement 5, and one more. Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements (5) is prime, which is true. Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements (2) is composite, which is false because 2 is not composite. So, a possible combination could be Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 being true.\n\n## Step 6: Check the Consistency of Exactly 5 True Statements\nLet's verify: Statement 1 is True (5 are true, so at least 4), Statement 2 is True (2 are false, so at most 4), Statement 3 is True (exactly 5 are true), Statement 4 is False (not 0 false), Statement 5 is True (Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is True (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is False (2 is not composite). This gives us 5 true statements (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and 2 false statements (4, 7), which is consistent.\n\n## Step 7: Examine Other Possible Combinations\nWe need to check other possible numbers of true statements that satisfy all given conditions and count how many such combinations exist.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 implies that at least 4 statements are true. Statement 2 implies that at most 4 statements are false, or at least 3 statements are true. Both statements being true means we have at least 4 true statements and at most 4 false statements, implying 3 or 4 true statements is possible if we only consider these two.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not composite and 1, 2, 3 are not composite).\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate All Possible Scenarios\n- For 7 true statements, Statement 4 must be true, which we've found to be inconsistent.\n- For 5 true statements, we've found a valid scenario.\n- For other numbers, we need to check consistency with all statements.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for 3 or 4 True Statements\nIf there are 3 true statements, Statement 1 is false. If there are 4 true statements, Statement 1 is true. We need to check if there's a combination that satisfies all conditions for 3 or 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed Check for 4 True Statements\nFor 4 true statements, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is also true because 3 statements are false, which is less than 4. Statement 3 is false because not exactly 5 are true. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5's truth depends on Statements 3 and 4; since both are false, Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 3 is not composite. So, Statements 1, 2, 7 are true, and we need one more true statement. If Statement 5 is the fourth true statement, it creates a contradiction because it would imply either Statement 3 or 4 is true but not both, and since both are false, it is actually true, making it a possible true statement. However, we need to check the consistency: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (False), Statement 7 (True). This gives 4 true statements, satisfying the condition.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 4: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the statements into mathematical expressions\nLet's denote the number of true statements as $T$ and the number of false statements as $F$. Thus, $T + F = 7$. Statement 1 implies $T \\geq 1$. Statement 2 implies $F \\leq 3$, hence $T \\geq 4$. Statement 3 implies $T = 5$. Statement 4 implies $F = 4$, hence $T = 3$. Statement 5 implies that either $T = 5$ or $T = 3$, but not both. Statement 6 implies $T$ is prime (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 implies $F$ is composite (4, 6).\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 ($T = 5$) or Statement 4 ($T = 3$) is true, but not both. If $T = 5$, then Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false because $T \\neq 3$. If $T = 3$, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the case when $T = 5$\nIf $T = 5$, then Statement 3 is true. This means Statement 4 is false. So, we have $T = 5$ and $F = 2$. Let's check the other statements: Statement 1 is true because $T \\geq 1$. Statement 2 is true because $F \\leq 3$. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true because $T = 5$ is prime. Statement 7 is false because $F = 2$ is not composite. So, we have 5 true statements (Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and 2 false statements (Statements 4, 7), which matches our initial assumption.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the case when $T = 3$\nIf $T = 3$, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false. So, $T = 3$ and $F = 4$. Let's check the other statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because $F = 4$ is not true, it violates the condition since $F$ is exactly 4. Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 is true because $T = 3$ is prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 4$ is composite. So, Statements 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 are true, which gives us $T = 5$, contradicting our assumption that $T = 3$. Thus, this scenario is not valid upon closer inspection because it doesn't satisfy the condition that exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Check for other possible values of $T$ based on Statement 2 and Statement 6\nFrom Statement 2, $T \\geq 4$. From Statement 6, $T$ must be prime. So, possible $T$ values are 5 and 7. We've already examined $T = 5$. For $T = 7$, all statements must be true. Let's check: Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false because $F = 0$ is less than 3. Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true or false simultaneously in a way that satisfies it. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is false. This gives us $T = 3$, which contradicts $T = 7$. So, $T = 7$ is not valid.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the validity of $T = 4$\nAlthough $T = 4$ is not directly implied by Statement 3 or Statement 4, it's worth checking because it satisfies Statement 2 ($T \\geq 4$) and is not prime, thus not satisfying Statement 6. For $T = 4$, $F = 3$. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 6 is false because $T = 4$ is not prime. Statement 7 is false because $F = 3$ is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 5 as true, giving $T = 3$, which does not match our $T = 4$ assumption.\n\n## Step 8: Summarize findings\nWe found that $T = 5$ is a valid solution where Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 are true. Other configurations either contradict the given statements or do not satisfy all conditions simultaneously.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This implies that not all statements can be false.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 4 statements must be true.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies 2 statements are false.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies 3 statements are true.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This statement's truth value depends on the truth values of Statements 3 and 4.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For 7 statements, possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 being true means that at least one statement is true. If all statements were false, Statement 1 would be false, creating a contradiction because it asserts at least one statement is true. Thus, Statement 1 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 2\nStatement 2 being true means at least 4 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then the number of true statements is at least 4.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the relationship between Statements 3 and 4\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they assert different numbers of true statements (5 and 3, respectively). Statement 5 says that exactly one of them is true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nIf Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Let's examine the scenarios:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because it correctly states that only one of Statements 3 or 4 is true.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements are true. This means Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because it correctly states that only one of Statements 3 or 4 is true.\n\n## Step 6: Check the consistency of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true. This implies 2 are false.\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 (actually 2) are false, so at least 5 are true.\n- Statement 3 is true by assumption.\n- Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 4 are false, which contradicts Statement 3.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true if 5 is prime, which it is.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\nThis gives us 5 true statements (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and 2 false statements (4, 7), which is consistent with Statement 3.\n\n## Step 7: Check the consistency of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements are true.\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false because it says at most 3 are false, but if 4 is true, then 4 are false, which violates Statement 2.\n- Statement 3 is false because it contradicts Statement 4.\n- Statement 4 is true by assumption.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true if 3 is prime, which it is.\n- Statement 7 is true because 4 (the number of false statements) is composite.\n\nThis gives us 3 true statements (1, 4, 5, 6, 7) is incorrect because it includes 4 true statements if we count Statement 7 as true. Let's correct this:\n- If Statement 4 is true, then Statements 1, 4, 5, and 6 are true. Statement 7 is also true because 4 is composite. So, we have 5 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption that Statement 4 is true (since it implies 3 true statements).\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the number of true statements based on the analysis\nFrom Step 6, if Statement 3 is true, we have a valid solution with 5 true statements.\nFrom Step 7, we see that assuming Statement 4 is true leads to an inconsistency because it results in 5 true statements (1, 4, 5, 6, 7), not 3.\n\n## Step 9: Check if there's any other possible number of true statements that satisfies all conditions\nLet's directly check the conditions given by the statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 10: Summarize findings\nWe have found one valid solution where Statement 3 is true, resulting in 5 true statements. Let's verify if this satisfies all statements:\n- Statement 1: True (at least 1 true).\n- Statement 2: True (at most 3 false, actually 2).\n- Statement 3: True.\n- Statement 4: False.\n- Statement 5: True.\n- Statement 6: True (5 is prime).\n- Statement 7: False (2 is not composite).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nWe are given 7 statements about the truthfulness of the statements themselves. We need to analyze each statement and determine the possible number of true statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 2 true statements. If it's false, then there are either 0 or 1 true statements.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies all 7 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then it must be that all statements are true, which is a contradiction because Statement 4 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false,' and if Statement 2 is true, Statement 4 must be false. Thus, Statement 2 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 4. So, Statement 2 cannot be true if Statement 4 is considered.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it is the only true statement, which means all other statements, including Statement 1, are false. This contradicts Statement 1 being false because if Statement 1 is false, there should be 0 or 1 true statement, which aligns with Statement 3 being true. However, we need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which is a contradiction. Thus, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 4 is false (from Step 5), for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 5 is true, which contradicts Statement 3 being the only true statement. Thus, Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Further analysis of Statements 3 and 5\nGiven Statement 4 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true. But if Statement 3 is true, it implies all other statements are false, including Statement 5. So, Statement 5 being true requires Statement 3 to be true, but then Statement 5 must be false because Statement 3 is the only true statement. This creates a contradiction, suggesting that if Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 must be false.\n\n## Step 8: Examine the implications of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are false. Statement 1 being false implies there are 0 or 1 true statements. Since Statement 3 is true, this condition is met (1 true statement). Statement 2 being false is consistent because not all statements are true. Statement 4 being false is consistent with our analysis. Statement 5 being false is also consistent because it requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both; since Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 being true makes Statement 5's condition partially met but Statement 5 itself is false, which is consistent. Statement 6 being false implies the number of true statements is not prime; with 1 true statement, this is true because 1 is not considered a prime number. Statement 7 being false implies the number of false statements is not composite; with 6 false statements, this is false because 6 is composite.\n\n## Step 9: Check for consistency with Statement 3 being true\n- Statement 1: False (0 or 1 true, so consistent)\n- Statement 2: False (not all true, so consistent)\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: False (consistent)\n- Statement 5: False (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, making the \"but not both\" condition true, but this is a contradiction since Statement 5 should be false if Statement 3 is the only true statement)\n- Statement 6: False (1 is not prime, so consistent)\n- Statement 7: False (6 is composite, so consistent)\n\n## Step 10: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 for other possible true statement counts\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, if the number of true statements is T, then the number of false statements is 7-T. For T = 2, 7-T = 5 (not composite); for T = 3, 7-T = 4 (composite); for T = 5, 7-T = 2 (not composite); for T = 7, 7-T = 0 (not composite, and also contradicts Statement 4 being false).\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the case when Statement 3 is false\nIf Statement 3 is false, then there are not exactly 1 true statement. This means there could be 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements. We've already established that Statement 4 is false, so there are not 7 false statements.\n\n## Step 12: Check for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6)\nFor T = 2 (prime), Statements 1 and 6 could be true. Statement 1 being true supports T >= 2. Statement 6 being true supports T being prime. Let's check if T = 2 or T = 3 could satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 13: Analyze for T = 3 (a prime number)\nIf T = 3, then Statements 1, 6, and one other could be true. For T = 3, 7-T = 4, which is composite, so Statement 7 is true. This gives us Statements 1, 6, and 7 as true, which is a valid scenario because it satisfies Statement 1 (at least 2 true), Statement 6 (3 is prime), and Statement 7 (4 is composite).\n\n## Step 14: Verify the consistency of T = 3\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: False (because not all statements are true)\n- Statement 3: False (because there are 3 true statements)\n- Statement 4: False (because not all statements are false)\n- Statement 5: False (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, so \"either...but not both\" is not satisfied)\n- Statement 6: True\n- Statement 7: True\n\nThis scenario is consistent.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

We need to analyze each statement and its implications on the others.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 1 is true, then there must be at least 2 true statements among the 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies all 7 statements must be true because there are no false statements. If Statement 2 is true, then all statements must be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it must be the only true statement, meaning all other statements are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means if Statement 4 is true, then it is false because it claims all statements are false, including itself. Thus, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given Statement 4 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true because Statement 4 is false. However, if Statement 3 is true, then it is the only true statement, making Statement 5 false. So, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are false. This satisfies Statement 3 being the only true statement. Let's check the other statements: Statement 1 is false because there's not at least 2 true statements. Statement 2 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 4 is false, which is consistent. Statement 5 is false because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, but it claims either is true but not both, which is actually true, creating a contradiction. Statement 6 is false because 1 is not considered a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 6 (the number of false statements) is a composite number.\n\n## Step 8: Resolve the contradiction for Statement 3 being true\nGiven Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 should be false because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. However, Statement 5 being true or false depends on the truth of Statement 3 and Statement 4. Since Statement 4 is false, Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3. If Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 is actually true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and this condition is met (Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false). This creates a contradiction because if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 5 should be false (as per Step 6), but it's actually true.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. If there are 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements, Statement 6 is true.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. If there are 4, 6, or other composite numbers of false statements, Statement 7 is true.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements together\nLet's examine possible scenarios based on the statements:\n1. If Statement 2 is true, all statements are true, which is impossible because Statement 4 cannot be true.\n2. Statement 4 is false.\n3. If Statement 3 is true, then only Statement 3 is true. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 false. However, we found a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 12: Check for possible solutions\nLet's directly evaluate the statements:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are false. Statement 7 is true because 6 is composite, which contradicts our assumption that only Statement 3 is true. So, our initial assumption that Statement 3 is true leads to a contradiction when considering Statement 7.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed examination of Statement 1 and its implications\nIf Statement 1 is true, there are at least 2 true statements. Let's consider the cases where Statement 1 is true and see if we can find valid configurations.\n\n## Step 14: Checking for valid configurations\nLet's analyze the statements again with the knowledge that Statement 4 is false:\n- Statement 1 being true implies at least 2 true statements.\n- Statement 2 being true implies all statements are true, which is not possible.\n- Statement 3 being true implies only Statement 3 is true, but this leads to a contradiction with other statements.\n\n## Step 15: Evaluating specific numbers of true statements\nLet's consider the number of true statements:\n- If there's exactly 1 true statement, it's Statement 3, but this leads to contradictions as seen.\n- If there are 2 true statements, Statement 1 is one of them. Possible pairs need to be checked.\n- If there are more than 2 true statements, we need to check the conditions that satisfy all true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This implies that the number of true statements is 2 or more.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This means all 7 statements must be true because there are no false statements.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that only one statement is true, and the rest are false.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means all statements are false.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This statement implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, exclusively.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. So, the number of false statements could be 4, 6, or other composite numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false,' which means all statements must be true. If all statements are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because there are 0 false statements.\n- Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 1 statement is true, but we've assumed all are true.\n- Statement 4 is false because it says all statements are false.\n- Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since both are false, it is technically true because it fulfills the condition of \"but not both\" being false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 7 (the number of true statements) is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not considered a composite number.\n\n## Step 3: Check the validity of Statement 2 being true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then all statements are true. However, we've found that not all statements can be true because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true (as they contradict the premise that all statements are true), and Statement 7 is false. Thus, Statement 2 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements based on Statement 1\nLet's consider Statement 1: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 2 true statements. We need to check the possible combinations.\n\n## Step 5: Examine Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they are mutually exclusive. Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 5 is true, then exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the case when Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly one statement is true. This means Statement 3 itself is the only true statement, and all others are false. Let's check:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false because it requires one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true and the other false, which is satisfied, but since Statement 4 is false, it holds.\n- Statement 6 is false because 1 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because 6 (the number of false statements) is a composite number.\n\nThis scenario is not valid because Statement 7 is true, contradicting the condition that only Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the case when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false. Let's check:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 should be true, which is a contradiction.\n- Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7 is false because 7 is not a composite number.\n\nThis creates a contradiction because Statement 5 should be true if Statement 4 is true, given that Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 8: Check for valid solutions based on prime and composite numbers\nLet's directly evaluate the possible number of true statements based on Statements 6 and 7:\n- Statement 6 says the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite.\n\n## Step 9: Examine possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n1. If 7 statements are true, Statement 2 is true, but this leads to a contradiction as seen in Step 3.\n2. If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. So, Statement 7 being false is consistent with 5 true statements.\n3. If 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n4. If 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. Statement 7 is true because 5 is not composite, it's a contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the scenarios\nFor 5 true statements:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 could be true or false depending on Statement 3 and Statement 4, but since both are false, it's false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\nFor 3 true statements:\n- We need to find a combination where 3 statements are true and satisfy all conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

If Statement 2 is true, then it must be that all statements are true, which is a contradiction because Statement 4 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false,' and if Statement 2 is true, Statement 4 must be false. Thus, Statement 2 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 4. So, Statement 2 cannot be true if Statement 4 is considered.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it is the only true statement, which means all other statements, including Statement 1, are false.

However, we need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which is a contradiction. Thus, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 4 is false (from Step 5), for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 5 is true, which contradicts Statement 3 being the only true statement. Thus, Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Further analysis of Statements 3 and 5\nGiven Statement 4 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true. But if Statement 3 is true, it implies all other statements are false, including Statement 5. So, Statement 5 being true requires Statement 3 to be true, but then Statement 5 must be false because Statement 3 is the only true statement. This creates a contradiction, suggesting that if Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 must be false.\n\n## Step 8: Examine the implications of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are false. Statement 1 being false implies there are 0 or 1 true statements. Since Statement 3 is true, this condition is met (1 true statement). Statement 2 being false is consistent because not all statements are true. Statement 4 being false is consistent with our analysis. Statement 5 being false is also consistent because it requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both; since Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 being true makes Statement 5's condition partially met but Statement 5 itself is false, which is consistent. Statement 6 being false implies the number of true statements is not prime; with 1 true statement, this is true because 1 is not considered a prime number. Statement 7 being false implies the number of false statements is not composite; with 6 false statements, this is false because 6 is composite.\n\n## Step 9: Check for consistency with Statement 3 being true\n- Statement 1: False (0 or 1 true, so consistent)\n- Statement 2: False (not all true, so consistent)\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: False (consistent)\n- Statement 5: False (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, making the \"but not both\" condition true, but this is a contradiction since Statement 5 should be false if Statement 3 is the only true statement)\n- Statement 6: False (1 is not prime, so consistent)\n- Statement 7: False (6 is composite, so consistent)\n\n## Step 10: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 for other possible true statement counts\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, if the number of true statements is T, then the number of false statements is 7-T. For T = 2, 7-T = 5 (not composite); for T = 3, 7-T = 4 (composite); for T = 5, 7-T = 2 (not composite); for T = 7, 7-T = 0 (not composite, and also contradicts Statement 4 being false).\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the case when Statement 3 is false\nIf Statement 3 is false, then there are not exactly 1 true statement. This means there could be 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements. We've already established that Statement 4 is false, so there are not 7 false statements.\n\n## Step 12: Check for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6)\nFor T = 2 (prime), Statements 1 and 6 could be true. Statement 1 being true supports T >= 2. Statement 6 being true supports T being prime. Let's check if T = 2 or T = 3 could satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 13: Analyze for T = 3 (a prime number)\nIf T = 3, then Statements 1, 6, and one other could be true. For T = 3, 7-T = 4, which is composite, so Statement 7 is true. This gives us Statements 1, 6, and 7 as true, which is a valid scenario because it satisfies Statement 1 (at least 2 true), Statement 6 (3 is prime), and Statement 7 (4 is composite).\n\n## Step 14: Verify the consistency of T = 3\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: False (because not all statements are true)\n- Statement 3: False (because there are 3 true statements)\n- Statement 4: False (because not all statements are false)\n- Statement 5: False (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, so \"either...but not both\" is not satisfied)\n- Statement 6: True\n- Statement 7: True\n\nThis scenario is consistent.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 implies that at least 5 of the 7 statements are true because if at most 2 are false, then 7 - 2 = 5 are true.\n\n## Step 3: Compare Statement 1 and Statement 2\nBoth Statement 1 and Statement 2 imply that at least 5 statements are true. Thus, they are equivalent in meaning regarding the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says exactly 3 statements are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 1 statement is false (meaning 6 are true). Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false. Given Statement 3 is true (3 true statements), it contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2. Given Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), it supports Statement 1 and Statement 2 being true.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the case when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 4 true. Statement 3 must be false because Statement 5 is true, and it dictates that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6 (since 6 is not prime, this will be examined), and Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite, this will be examined) to evaluate.\n\n## Step 7: Check the validity of Statement 6 and Statement 7 when Statement 4 is true\nIf 6 statements are true, then Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite. So, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (False), Statement 7 (False). This gives us 4 true statements, not 6, which contradicts our initial assumption that Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. Statement 4 must be false because of Statement 5. So, we need to find a combination where exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements when Statement 3 is true\nLet's consider Statement 3 being true. Then, Statement 1 and Statement 2 cannot both be true because they imply more than 3 true statements. Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, and Statement 3 is true. So, we have at least Statement 3 and Statement 5 as true.\n\n## Step 10: Check possible combinations for exactly 3 true statements\nWe need to check if there's a valid combination where exactly 3 statements are true, including Statement 3 and Statement 5. The other true statement could be any one of the remaining statements.\n\n## Step 11: Examine potential true statements alongside Statement 3 and Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 5 are true, and one other statement is true, we examine each possibility. Statement 1 being true would mean at least 5 true statements, which contradicts Statement 3. Statement 2 being true also implies at least 5 true statements. Statement 4 being true contradicts Statement 5. Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements (3) is prime, which is true. Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements (4) is composite, which is true.\n\n## Step 12: Check if Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6 can be true\nIf Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true, then we have 3 true statements. Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 7 are false. This gives us: Statement 1 (False), Statement 2 (False), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True), Statement 7 (False). Here, 3 statements are true, which matches Statement 3.\n\n## Step 13: Check if Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 7 can be true\nIf Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 7 are true, then we have 3 true statements. The number of false statements is 4, which is composite, so Statement 7 is true. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false because they imply more than 3 true statements. Statement 4 is false because Statement 5 is true and it says only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. Statement 6 is false because 3 is prime. So, we have: Statement 1 (False), Statement 2 (False), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (False), Statement 7 (True), which matches our condition.\n\n## Step 14: Count the number of valid solutions\nWe found two valid combinations: (Statement 1 (False), Statement 2 (False), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True), Statement 7 (False)) and (Statement 1 (False), Statement 2 (False), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (False), Statement 7 (True)).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This means the number of true statements (T) is $T \\geq 5$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2.\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that $T \\geq 5$ because if there are at most 2 false statements, there are at least 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3.\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' So, $T = 3$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4.\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This means $T = 6$ because if exactly 1 statement is false, then 6 are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5.\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This implies that if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. So, we have two scenarios to consider based on Statement 5: (i) $T = 3$ and $T \\neq 6$, or (ii) $T = 6$ and $T \\neq 3$. Since $T = 3$ and $T = 6$ are mutually exclusive, Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6.\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7.\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The number of false statements is $7 - T$. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $7 - T = 4$ or $6$, implying $T = 3$ or $1$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the consistency of the statements.\nLet's examine the possible values of $T$ based on the statements:\n- From Statement 1 and Statement 2, $T \\geq 5$.\n- Statement 3 implies $T = 3$, which contradicts $T \\geq 5$.\n- Statement 4 implies $T = 6$, which satisfies $T \\geq 5$.\n- For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but not both. Since Statement 3 is false (because $T = 3$ contradicts $T \\geq 5$), Statement 4 being true satisfies Statement 5.\n- Statement 6 is true if $T$ is prime. $T = 6$ is not prime, so Statement 6 is false if $T = 6$.\n- Statement 7 is true if $7 - T$ is composite. For $T = 6$, $7 - T = 1$, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 10: Check the truthfulness of the statements based on $T$.\nGiven $T \\geq 5$ from Statements 1 and 2, let's check the possible values of $T$:\n- If $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (because 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (because $7-5 = 2$ is not composite). So, $T = 5$ gives 4 true statements, which contradicts $T = 5$. Thus, $T = 5$ is not a solution.\n- If $T = 6$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 is false (because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (because $7-6 = 1$ is not composite). So, $T = 6$ gives 4 true statements (Statements 1, 2, 4, 5), which again contradicts $T = 6$. Thus, $T = 6$ is not a solution.\n- If $T = 7$, then all statements must be true. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false (contradiction), so $T = 7$ is not possible.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed check for $T = 5$ and $T = 6$.\nFor $T = 5$: Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true. Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 7 is false. This gives $T = 4$, which does not match $T = 5$.\nFor $T = 6$: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5 are true. Statement 3 is false, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. This gives $T = 4$, which does not match $T = 6$.\n\n## Step 12: Re-evaluate the statements for consistency.\nUpon closer inspection, we need to directly assess which statements can be true or false together.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Statement 4: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 implies that the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7. Statement 2 implies that the number of false statements is 0, 1, or 2, which means the number of true statements is 7, 6, or 5. Both statements essentially convey the same information and are true if the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says exactly 3 statements are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 1 statement is false (meaning 6 are true). Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 3 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2. So, Statement 3 being true is not possible if we are to satisfy Statement 1 and Statement 2. Thus, Statement 4 must be true (because Statement 5 says one of them must be true but not both), and Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the number of true statements based on Statement 4 being true\nSince Statement 4 is true, exactly 1 statement is false, and 6 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2 because 6 is within the range they specify.\n\n## Step 6: Check if having 6 true statements satisfies Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Since 6 is not a prime number, having 6 true statements contradicts Statement 6. Thus, Statement 6 must be one of the false statements.\n\n## Step 7: Verify if the conditions satisfy all statements with 6 true statements\nWith 6 true statements, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 7 are true. Statement 3 is false because it claims exactly 3 statements are true. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. So, we have Statement 3 and Statement 6 as false, which doesn't match our initial assumption that only one statement is false.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate the statements for consistency with the condition that exactly 1 statement is false (Statement 4 is true)\nGiven Statement 4 is true, and thus 6 statements are true, we need to identify which statement is false. We've established that Statement 6 cannot be true if 6 statements are true. Let's check other statements for potential falsity.\n\n## Step 9: Assess the truthfulness of Statement 7 with 6 true statements\nWith 6 true statements, 1 is false. The number of false statements is 1, which is not composite. Thus, Statement 7 is false because 1 is not considered a composite number.\n\n## Step 10: Check for consistency\nIf Statement 7 is false, then we have 6 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6) and 1 false statement (Statement 7 or Statement 3). But we've seen that if Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false. So, one possible scenario is Statement 3 being false and Statement 7 being false, but this gives us 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the scenario where Statement 6 is false\nIf Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime, then Statement 4 being true (6 true statements) is consistent with Statement 6 being false. Let's verify: Statement 1 (true), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (true), Statement 5 (true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 (false), Statement 7 (true because 1 is not composite, so it's false). So, we have 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which contradicts Statement 4.\n\n## Step 12: Examine the number of true statements being 5\nLet's consider if 5 statements are true. This would mean Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true. Statement 3 being false (since it says exactly 3 are true) and Statement 4 being false (since it says exactly 1 is false, implying 6 are true) could be a possibility. Statement 5 would be false because it requires exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6 (if 5 is prime, it's true), and Statement 7 (if 2 is composite, it's false) as potential truths or falsehoods.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the prime condition for 5 true statements\n5 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true. The number of false statements is 2, which is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 14: Check the consistency for 5 true statements\nLet's assume Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6 are true, and Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 7 are false. This gives us 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which doesn't fit. Adjusting our assumption: If Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, Statement 7 are true, and Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5 are false, we have 4 true and 3 false, which again doesn't fit. A valid scenario could be: Statement 1 (true), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (true because one of them is true and the other is false, but here both are false, so it's false), Statement 6 (true), Statement 7 (false). This gives 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 14: Reconsider the case where 5 statements are true\nFor 5 true statements: Statement 1 (true), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 (true), Statement 7 (true because 2 is not composite). This scenario doesn't work because Statement 7 is actually false since 2 is prime, not composite.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which means 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This is because if you have 7 statements and at most 3 are false, then at least 4 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true,' and Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which is equivalent to saying 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Thus, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent and cannot both be true or both be false according to Statement 5.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 5\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.') must be false because it asserts that one of them is true and the other is false, which is impossible since they convey the same information.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the truthfulness based on Statement 5 being false\nSince Statement 5 is false, we have at least one false statement. Let's denote the number of true statements as T. So, we have T = 7 - F, where F is the number of false statements.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the implications of Statement 1 being true\nIf Statement 1 is true, then T \u2265 6. This means F \u2264 1. Given that Statement 5 is false, F \u2265 1. So, if Statement 1 is true, F = 1, and T = 6.\n\n## Step 7: Check if T = 6 satisfies all statements\nIf T = 6, then Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because having 1 false statement means at least 4 (actually 6) statements are true, satisfying 'at least 4 true.' Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 4 are true. Statement 4 is false for the same reason as Statement 3. Statement 5 is false, as established. Statement 6: T = 6 is not a prime number (it's composite), so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7: F = 1 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. Thus, we have 6 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, and the falseness of Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), but this doesn't match our initial assumption that only Statement 5 is false. We actually have T = 6 and F = 1, with Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 being false.\n\n## Step 8: Verify the consistency of T = 6\nLet's verify: Statement 1 is true (T = 6 \u2265 6), Statement 2 is true (F = 1 \u2264 3), Statement 3 is false (T \u2260 4), Statement 4 is false (F \u2260 3), Statement 5 is false (as it's contradictory for equivalent statements), Statement 6 is false (6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (1 is not composite). So, we have Statements 1 and 2 true, and Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 false. This gives us T = 2, which contradicts our assumption of T = 6. Let's re-evaluate our steps.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate the statements with the knowledge that Statement 5 is false\nSince Statement 5 is false, and Statements 3 and 4 are equivalent, they should either both be true or both be false. If both are true, T = 4. If both are false, T \u2260 4.\n\n## Step 10: Check the case when T = 4 (both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true)\nIf T = 4, then Statement 1 is false (since T < 6), Statement 2 is true (since T = 4 means F = 3, which is \u2264 3), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (since F = 3 is composite). So, we have Statements 2, 3, 4, 7 true and Statements 1, 5, 6 false, giving T = 4, which matches.\n\n## Step 11: Check other possible values of T\nFor T = 7, all statements must be true, but this contradicts Statement 5 being false. For T = 5, Statement 1 is false (since T < 6), and we need to check other statements. For T = 3 or less, Statement 2 is false.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze T = 5\nIf T = 5, then F = 2. Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is true because F = 2 is \u2264 3. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite (it's prime). So, we have Statements 2 and 6 true, and the rest false, giving T = 2, which doesn't match our T = 5 assumption.\n\n## Step 13: Summarize findings\nWe found that when T = 4, we have a valid solution where Statements 2, 3, 4, 7 are true, and Statements 1, 5, 6 are false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says exactly 4 statements are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 3 statements are false, which means 4 statements are true. These two statements are essentially saying the same thing, so they cannot be both true because they are identical in meaning.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate Statement 5 based on the analysis of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 have the same meaning, Statement 5, which states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both,' must be false because it is impossible for only one of them to be true when they convey the same information.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the implications of Statement 5 being false\nWith Statement 5 being false, we now have to consider the truth values of the other statements. Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, let's consider their joint truth value. If either is true, then 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the truthfulness of Statement 1\nStatement 1 says at least 6 of the 7 statements are true. If this is true, then 6 or 7 statements must be true. This would mean Statement 5 is true (because it's one of the 7), which contradicts our finding that Statement 5 is false. Thus, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the truthfulness of Statement 2\nStatement 2 says at most 3 of the 7 statements are false, meaning at least 4 statements are true. This is a possibility since it doesn't directly contradict our initial findings.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the possible number of true statements based on Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are true. Let's check if this satisfies other conditions. Statement 2 allows for 4 or more true statements, so it could be true if 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 8: Check the consistency of having 4 true statements\nIf 4 statements are true, then Statement 1 is false (because not at least 6 are true), Statement 2 is true (because at most 3 are false), Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true (let's say one of them is true, making 4 true statements), Statement 5 is false (as established), Statement 6 needs to be checked (4 is not prime), and Statement 7 needs to be checked (3 false statements is not composite).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 under the condition of 4 true statements\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. With 4 true statements, this is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. With 3 false statements, this is false because 3 is not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Assess the truth values\nLet's assess: If Statement 3 is true (and thus Statement 4 is true because they are equivalent), we have 4 true statements. So, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. This gives us 4 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and none other because Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are false, and Statement 1 is false).\n\n## Step 11: Verify if the condition satisfies all given statements\nWith Statement 3 being true, we have 4 true statements. So, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. Let's count: True statements = 3 (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4), False statements = 4 (Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7). This contradicts our assumption of 4 true statements because Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true implies 4 true statements, but we actually have 3 true statements in this scenario.\n\n## Step 12: Re-evaluate the statements for other possible configurations\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements. If 4 statements are true, Statement 6 is false. For 4 true statements, Statement 7 is false because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 13: Check for other possible numbers of true statements\nLet's analyze other possibilities: If 5 statements are true, then Statement 1 is false (because not at least 6 are true), Statement 2 is true (at most 2 are false), Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (2 is not composite, so this is false). For 5 true statements, we have a contradiction because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 14: Consider the case when Statement 1 is false and its implications\nSince Statement 1 is false, we know that fewer than 6 statements are true. Let's directly analyze the statements for possible configurations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

This implies that the number of true statements is 6 or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means the number of false statements is 0, 1, 2, or 3, implying the number of true statements is 7, 6, 5, or 4, respectively.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states that 4 statements are true and 3 are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply the same thing (4 true statements), Statement 5 must be false because it's impossible for exactly one of them to be true if they say the same thing.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 according to this statement.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the statements\nLet's evaluate the statements together. Statement 5 is false as per Step 6. So, we have at least 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 10: Check the implications of Statement 1 and Statement 2\nIf Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements are true, which means Statement 5 being false is consistent with 6 true statements. Statement 2 allows for up to 3 false statements, so it can be true if there are 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements.\n\n## Step 11: Examine the consistency of the statements with the number of true statements\n- If 6 statements are true (and thus 1 is false), Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is also true because there is 1 false statement. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false because they claim 4 true statements. We've already established Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. So, we have 6 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and three others cannot be true because Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 7 are false, and Statement 5 is false), which doesn't fit.\n- Let's directly check the possible numbers of true statements based on all statements.\n\n## Step 12: Checking possible scenarios based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 suggest 4 true statements. If 4 statements are true, then Statement 1 is false (because it says at least 6 are true), Statement 2 is true (because 3 are false, which is within \"at most 3\"), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 3 is not composite, this is actually false). So, we have Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 7 being considered for truth. However, Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check for 4 true statements\nFor 4 true statements: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. So, we actually have 3 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4) and 4 false statements, which contradicts our assumption of 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 14: Checking for 5 true statements\nIf 5 statements are true, then Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (because 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (because 2 is not composite). So, we have Statement 2, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as true. This gives us 3 true statements so far, and we need 2 more to make 5. Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 7 are false. This scenario doesn't work because it doesn't satisfy having 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 15: Checking for other possible numbers of true statements\nLet's directly assess the feasibility based on prime (Statement 6) and composite (Statement 7) conditions along with other statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which means 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This is because if you have 7 statements and at most 3 are false, then at least 4 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true,' and Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which is equivalent to saying 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Thus, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent and cannot both be true or both be false according to Statement 5.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 5\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.') must be false because it asserts that one of them is true and the other is false, which is impossible since they convey the same information.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the truthfulness based on Statement 5 being false\nSince Statement 5 is false, we have at least one false statement. Let's denote the number of true statements as T. So, we have T = 7 - F, where F is the number of false statements.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the implications of Statement 1 being true\nIf Statement 1 is true, then T \u2265 6. This means F \u2264 1. Given that Statement 5 is false, F \u2265 1. So, if Statement 1 is true, F = 1, and T = 6.\n\n## Step 7: Check if T = 6 satisfies all statements\nIf T = 6, then Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because having 1 false statement means at least 4 (actually 6) statements are true, satisfying 'at least 4 true.' Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 4 are true. Statement 4 is false for the same reason as Statement 3. Statement 5 is false, as established. Statement 6: T = 6 is not a prime number (it's composite), so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7: F = 1 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. Thus, we have 6 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, and the falseness of Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), but this doesn't match our initial assumption that only Statement 5 is false. We actually have T = 6 and F = 1, with Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 being false.\n\n## Step 8: Verify the consistency of T = 6\nLet's verify: Statement 1 is true (T = 6 \u2265 6), Statement 2 is true (F = 1 \u2264 3), Statement 3 is false (T \u2260 4), Statement 4 is false (F \u2260 3), Statement 5 is false (as it's contradictory for equivalent statements), Statement 6 is false (6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (1 is not composite). So, we have Statements 1 and 2 true, and Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 false. This gives us T = 2, which contradicts our assumption of T = 6. Let's re-evaluate our steps.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate the statements with the knowledge that Statement 5 is false\nSince Statement 5 is false, and Statements 3 and 4 are equivalent, they should either both be true or both be false. If both are true, T = 4. If both are false, T \u2260 4.\n\n## Step 10: Check the case when T = 4 (both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true)\nIf T = 4, then Statement 1 is false (since T < 6), Statement 2 is true (since T = 4 means F = 3, which is \u2264 3), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (since F = 3 is composite). So, we have Statements 2, 3, 4, 7 true and Statements 1, 5, 6 false, giving T = 4, which matches.\n\n## Step 11: Check other possible values of T\nFor T = 7, all statements must be true, but this contradicts Statement 5 being false. For T = 5, Statement 1 is false (since T < 6), and we need to check other statements. For T = 3 or less, Statement 2 is false.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze T = 5\nIf T = 5, then F = 2. Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is true because F = 2 is \u2264 3. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite (it's prime). So, we have Statements 2 and 6 true, and the rest false, giving T = 2, which doesn't match our T = 5 assumption.\n\n## Step 13: Summarize findings\nWe found that when T = 4, we have a valid solution where Statements 2, 3, 4, 7 are true, and Statements 1, 5, 6 are false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

If it's false, then there are fewer than 3 true statements, meaning 2 or fewer.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 0 statements are true because if 7 statements are false, 0 are true. So, it implies there is at least 1 true statement (since 7 false statements would mean 0 true, but it's always true because you can't have more than 7 false out of 7).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 is always true because you can't have more than 7 statements being false out of 7 statements.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'

If Statement 4 is true (and Statement 3 is false), Statement 5 is true.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true.

Statement 1 could be true or false depending on the total number of true statements. Since Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. So, we have Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 5 as true, which gives us 3 true statements. This contradicts Statement 3.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false, and 5 are true. Statement 3 must be one of the false statements. Statement 2 is true. Statement 1 is true because there are at least 3 true statements (actually 5). Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 needs to be checked for the number of true statements being prime. Since there are 5 true statements, and 5 is prime, Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. There are 2 false statements, and 2 is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 13: Check the consistency when Statement 4 is true\nWith Statement 4 being true, we have: Statement 1 (true), Statement 2 (true), Statement 4 (true), Statement 5 (true), and Statement 6 (true) as the 5 true statements. Statement 3 and Statement 7 are false. This scenario is consistent.\n\n## Step 14: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 for other possible scenarios\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number.

Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6).\n\n## Step 15: Summarize possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\n- If there are 2 true statements, Statement 3 is true, but this leads to a contradiction as seen in Step 11.\n- If there are 3 true statements, Statement 1 is true. We need to check if this can be consistent with other statements.\n- If there are 5 true statements, we've found a valid scenario in Step 13.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Let's analyze them one by one to understand their implications.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.' If true, then there are 3 or more true statements.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 0 statements are true, which is always true since it means there are 0 or more true statements. Thus, Statement 2 is always true because you cannot have more than 7 statements being false out of 7.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' If true, then exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that exactly 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they imply different numbers of true statements (2 vs 5).\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements. Statement 4 would be false because it claims exactly 2 statements are false, implying 5 true statements. If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements, making Statement 3 false.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Possible numbers of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 since 0 is not considered composite.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 2 being always true\nSince Statement 2 is always true, we have at least 1 true statement.\n\n## Step 11: Check the validity of Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then at least 3 statements are true. This could be possible.\n\n## Step 12: Examine possible scenarios based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 1 being true because if Statement 3 is true, Statement 1 must be false (since 2 is not at least 3). Statement 5 would be true because Statement 4 is false, resulting in at least 2 true statements (Statement 2 and Statement 3, and Statement 5). However, this scenario needs to be checked against other statements.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the scenario where Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. So, we have Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 5 as true, which gives us 3 true statements. This contradicts Statement 3 being true because it says exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate the scenario where Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true. This means Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, fulfilling its condition. So, we have Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and potentially others as true.\n\n## Step 15: Check if having exactly 5 true statements satisfies all conditions\nWith Statement 4 being true (and thus 5 true statements), Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6 (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite, this could be a problem) are considered. Statement 1 is also true because at least 3 statements are true. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as true. This gives us 5 true statements, which satisfies Statement 4 and Statement 6. However, Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 16: Verify the consistency of having 5 true statements\n- Statement 1: True (5 true statements is at least 3).\n- Statement 2: True (always true).\n- Statement 3: False.\n- Statement 4: True.\n- Statement 5: True.\n- Statement 6: True (5 is prime).\n- Statement 7: False (2 is not composite).\n\nThis configuration is consistent with having exactly 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 17: Check other possible numbers of true statements\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of other configurations.\n\n## Step 18: Summarize findings\nWe found that having exactly 5 true statements is a valid solution. Let's check if there are other valid configurations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This statement is always true because it means that the number of false statements can be 7 or less, which is inherently true. So, Statement 2 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. This would mean Statement 4 is false because it claims exactly 2 statements are false (implying 5 are true). If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false, meaning 5 statements are true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they imply different numbers of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 5\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 5 is true, then it supports the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true exclusively. We need to check the validity of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false based on other statements.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the truthfulness based on Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4\nLet's consider the scenarios:\n- If Statement 3 is true (2 true statements), then Statement 1 (at least 3 true) is false. This scenario is possible if we have exactly 2 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the number of true statements based on given conditions\nLet's denote the number of true statements as $T$ and the number of false statements as $F$. We have $T + F = 7$.\n- If $T = 2$ (Statement 3 is true), then $F = 5$. Statement 4 is false, Statement 1 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is false because 2 is prime but we need to check other statements. Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite.\n- If $T = 5$ (Statement 4 is true), then $F = 2$. Statement 3 is false. Statement 1 is true. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 7: Check the validity of each possible scenario\n1. $T = 2$, $F = 5$: Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 1 is false, Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false), Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true (2 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (5 is composite). So, we have Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as true, which gives $T = 5$, contradicting our initial assumption of $T = 2$. Thus, this scenario is not valid upon closer inspection because it doesn't satisfy $T = 2$.\n2. $T = 5$, $F = 2$: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. So, Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are true, which matches $T = 5$. This is a valid scenario.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate other possible values of $T$\nLet's directly check the conditions given by the statements for other possible $T$ values and see if they satisfy all given conditions.\n\n## Step 9: Checking for $T = 3, 4, 6, 7$\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true because one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is not true (both are false). Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). Statement 2 is true. So, we have $T = 4$ ( Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 are true), which doesn't match $T = 3$.\n- For $T = 4$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (3 is not composite, it's prime). Statement 2 is true. So, Statements 1, 2, 5, 7 are true, giving $T = 4$, which is a potential solution.\n\n## Step 10: Validate the potential solutions\n1. For $T = 5$: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 are true. This is a valid solution.\n2. For $T = 4$: Statements 1, 2, 5, 7 are true. This is a valid solution.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states, 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 4 of the statements must be true because 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims, 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states that 4 out of 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says, 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that exactly 4 of the statements are true because 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states, 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that exactly 4 statements are true, they are essentially saying the same thing, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false under the given conditions. Thus, Statement 5 cannot be true if Statements 3 and 4 are both true or both false.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statements 3 and 4 being true or false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 4 also being true would mean the same. However, Statement 5 says only one of them can be true. So, if Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says, 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' For 7 statements, the possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims, 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements can range from 0 to 7. The composite numbers in this range are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the statements\nLet's check the consistency of the statements with the possible number of true statements.\n\n- If all statements are true (Statement 1 is true), then Statement 5 cannot be true because both Statements 3 and 4 are true, which contradicts Statement 5.

Statement 5 cannot be true because it requires one of Statements 3 or 4 to be false. So, we have Statements 3 and 4 as true, and Statement 5 as false.\n\n## Step 13: Further analysis with exactly 4 true statements\nWith exactly 4 true statements, Statement 1 is false (because it says at least 7 are true), Statement 2 is true (because at most 3 are false), Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not a prime number), and Statement 7 is true (because 3 is not a composite number, this statement is actually false since 3 is not composite).\n\n## Step 14: Detailed check for exactly 4 true statements\nLet's list the statements and their truth values assuming exactly 4 are true: Statements 3 and 4 are true. Statement 2 is true because there are 3 false statements. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. So, we have: S1 = False, S2 = True, S3 = True, S4 = True, S5 = False, S6 = False, S7 = False.

This implies that at least 4 of the 7 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then there are 4 or more true statements.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This gives a specific count of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'

However, this contradicts Statement 5 because if all statements are true, then Statements 3 and 4 being true would make Statement 5 false.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the Conditions for Statements 1 and 2\nFor Statement 1 to be true, all statements must be true, which we've established creates a contradiction with Statement 5. Statement 2 being true means at least 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 10: Check the Consistency of Statements\nLet's check the consistency of the statements with possible numbers of true statements. Statement 1 requires 7 true statements. Statement 2 allows for 4 to 7 true statements. Statement 3 and Statement 4 require exactly 4 true statements. Statement 5 requires that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is false, implying not exactly 4 true statements if it's true.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate Possible Scenarios Based on Statement 5 Being True\nIf Statement 5 is true, then Statements 3 and 4 are false. This means the number of true statements is not 4. Let's examine other statements under this condition.\n\n## Step 12: Assess the Number of True Statements\nLet's consider the number of true statements (T) and false statements (F), where T + F = 7. Statement 6 says T is prime, and Statement 7 says F is composite.\n\n## Step 13: Examine Possible Values for T and F\nPossible values for T are 2, 3, 5, 7 (prime numbers less than or equal to 7). Corresponding F values are 5, 4, 2, 0. For F to be composite (Statement 7), F could be 4 (since 0 is not considered composite, and 2 is not composite).\n\n## Step 14: Check for T = 3 (and thus F = 4)\nIf T = 3, then Statement 7 is true because F = 4 is composite. Statement 6 is true because T = 3 is prime. We need to check if other statements can be true or false accordingly.\n\n## Step 15: Detailed Check for T = 3\nFor T = 3, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false (since at most 3 false statements means at least 4 true), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, but it requires only one of them to be true), Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true. So, Statements 4, 6, and 7 are true, which gives T = 3.\n\n## Step 16: Verify if T = 3 Satisfies All Conditions\nFor T = 3, we have Statements 4, 6, and 7 as true. This satisfies the condition for T = 3. Let's verify: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true, Statement 7 is true. This configuration works.\n\n## Step 17: Check Other Possible Scenarios\nLet's check for other possible T values: For T = 2, F = 5; for T = 5, F = 2; for T = 7, F = 0. For T = 2, Statement 6 is true, but Statement 7 is false because F = 5 is not composite. For T = 5, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false because F = 2 is not composite. For T = 7, Statement 1 is true, which leads to a contradiction as seen before.\n\n## Step 18: Evaluate T = 5\nFor T = 5, Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 need to be evaluated. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (since both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). So, Statements 2, 5, and 6 are true, which doesn't satisfy T = 5.\n\n## Step 19: Summarize Findings\nWe have found at least one valid configuration (T = 3) where Statements 4, 6, and 7 are true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

However, we need to check if this is possible by examining the other statements.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of all statements being true\nIf all 7 statements are true (as per Statement 1), then Statement 2 is true because at most 3 being false means at least 4 are true, and having all 7 true satisfies this.

Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since both are false, it is technically true. Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not considered a composite number. Thus, having all statements true leads to a contradiction because Statements 3, 4, and 7 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says at most 3 statements are false, meaning at least 4 are true. This is consistent with Statements 3 and 4 being potentially true since both imply 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statements 3 and 4 imply that exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This creates a contradiction if we assume both are true. However, if exactly 4 statements are true, then Statement 5 must be one of the false statements because it cannot be true that exactly one of Statements 3 and 4 is true if they both say the same thing.\n\n## Step 6: Check the consistency of having exactly 4 true statements\nIf exactly 4 statements are true, then Statements 3 and 4 are true. Statement 5 must be false because it asserts that only one of Statements 3 or 4 is true. Statement 1 is false because it claims at least 7 are true. Statement 2 is true because having 4 true statements means 3 are false, which satisfies \"at most 3 false.\" Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is true because 3 is not a composite number, but this is a point to check: 3 is not composite, it's prime, so Statement 7 is false. So, we have Statements 2, 3, and 4 as true, and Statement 7 is false. This gives us 3 true statements so far (2, 3, 4) and Statement 5 is false. We need one more true statement. Statement 1 is false, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. So, we can't have exactly 4 true statements with this configuration because we can't satisfy having exactly 4 true statements without violating the conditions set by the other statements.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 5's impact\nStatement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This implies that exactly 4 statements are not true (because if one of 3 or 4 is true, the other is false, and they both claim 4 true statements). If Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or vice versa, we have a contradiction because they both state the same condition (4 true statements).\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, if the number of false statements is composite, it could be 4 or 6 because those are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 9: Check for possible configurations\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements that satisfy all given conditions. If 7 statements are true, it's not possible due to the contradictions found. Let's examine other possibilities based on prime numbers (Statement 6) and composite numbers (Statement 7).\n\n## Step 10: Examine possible solutions based on the number of true statements\n- If 7 are true, Statement 1 is true, but it leads to contradictions as seen.\n- If 5 are true (a prime number), then 2 are false. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false (because 2 is prime, not composite). This gives us a possible configuration: Statements 2, 5, and 6 are true. We need 2 more true statements. This configuration can be achieved if we let Statements 2, 5, 6, and one other be true. Let's check: If Statements 2, 5, 6 are true, and Statement 7 is false, we have 3 true and 4 false, which doesn't satisfy having 5 true. However, if we consider Statement 2 being true (at most 3 false, so at least 4 true), and we have 5 true, it fits. A possible configuration could be Statements 2, 5, 6 being true, and two others. For example, having Statements 1 and 3 or 4 being false helps. A valid configuration is having Statements 2, 5, 6 true, and Statements 3 and 4 false, and Statement 1 false, and Statement 7 false. This gives 3 true statements. To get to 5 true, we need two more. This step requires checking various combinations.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed check for 5 true statements\nLet's assume 5 statements are true. Then, 2 are false. For Statement 6 to be true, 5 being prime satisfies it. For Statement 7 to be false (since 2 is not composite), it fits. Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is true because 2 false statements satisfy \"at most 3 false.\" Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true would mean exactly 4 are true, which contradicts our assumption of 5 being true. So, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 should be false. Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since both are false, it is true. So, we have Statements 2 and 5 as true. We need 3 more true statements. Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), so that's one. We can make Statement 7 false (2 is not composite), which is one of the false statements. So, a possible configuration is: Statements 2, 5, 6 true; Statements 1, 7 false; and we need 2 more true statements. Statements 3 and 4 are false. This leaves us with choosing 2 more true statements from the remaining, but we've already established that Statements 3 and 4 are false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Thus, $T + F = 7$. Statement 1 implies $T \\geq 2$. Statement 2 implies $F \\leq 1$, hence $T \\geq 6$. Statement 3 implies $T = 4$. Statement 4 implies $F = 3$, hence $T = 4$. Statement 5 implies that either $T = 4$ or $F = 3$ (which again implies $T = 4$) is true, but not both, which is a contradiction since both imply $T = 4$, so Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 implies $T$ is prime. Statement 7 implies $F$ is composite.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2 and its implications\nSince $T + F = 7$, Statement 2 ($F \\leq 1$) implies $T \\geq 6$.

Statement 7 ($F$ is composite) is false because 1 is not composite. Statement 1 is true because $T = 6 \\geq 2$. Statement 3 is false because $T = 6 \\neq 4$. Statement 4 is false because $F = 1 \\neq 3$. Statement 5 is false as analyzed. Statement 6 is true because $T = 6$ is not prime, it's a contradiction, so $T = 6$ is not valid under Statement 6.

Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 7 is prime. Statement 7 is false. So, $T = 3$ (Statements 1, 2, 6), which contradicts $T = 7$. Thus, $T = 7$ is also not a valid solution under the given conditions because it doesn't satisfy the count of true statements as per the statements themselves.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluate the statements for other possible values of $T$\nGiven that $T = 6$ or $T = 7$ are the only possibilities if Statement 2 is true, and both lead to contradictions, we need to check if Statement 2 can be false. If Statement 2 is false, then $F > 1$, meaning $T < 6$. Let's directly examine the implications of each statement and possible values of $T$.\n\n## Step 7: Check for $T = 4$ as it satisfies Statements 3 and 4\nIf $T = 4$, then $F = 3$. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 is true. Statement 5 is false because both Statements 3 and 4 are true. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 3 is not composite but this is a special case as 3 is prime, not composite. So, $T = 4$ gives us Statements 1, 3, 4 true, and Statements 2, 5, 6 false, and Statement 7 is false. Thus, $T = 3$ (for Statements 1, 3, 4), which does not match $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze other potential values of $T$ and check for consistency\nLet's directly check the statements for other plausible $T$.

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.

This means that at least 6 statements must be true. Let's examine the possible values of $T$ given this constraint.\n- If $T = 6$, then Statement 2 is true, and Statements 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 need to be evaluated for truthfulness.\n- If $T = 7$, then all statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements when $T = 7$\nIf $T = 7$, then:\n- Statement 1 is true because $7 \\geq 2$.\n- Statement 2 is true because $7 \\geq 6$ (since only 0 statements are false).\n- Statement 3 is false because $T = 7$, not 4.\n- Statement 4 is false because $F = 0$, not 3.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, but it requires exactly one of them to be true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because $F = 0$, and 0 is not considered composite.\n\nSince $T = 7$ results in Statements 3, 4, 5, and 7 being false, $T$ cannot be 7 because it contradicts the assumption that all statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements when $T = 6$\nIf $T = 6$, then $F = 1$.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze the given statements. Statement 1 says at least 2 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 says at most 1 of the 7 statements are false, implying at least 6 are true. Statement 3 claims exactly 4 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 4 claims exactly 3 of the 7 statements are false, which means exactly 4 are true. Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 states the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 states the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2 and its implications.\nStatement 2 implies that at least 6 out of 7 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then it must be one of the true statements, supporting its own claim. This means 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 2 being true.\nIf Statement 2 is true, then either 6 or 7 statements are true. If 7 statements are true, then Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 must all be true. However, Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they both claim exactly 4 statements are true, which contradicts the condition that 7 statements are true. Thus, having 7 true statements is impossible because it violates Statement 5's condition indirectly by making both Statement 3 and Statement 4 true, which Statement 5 forbids.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the case where exactly 6 statements are true.\nIf exactly 6 statements are true, then Statement 2 is one of them. This implies one statement is false. Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements (actually 6) are true. For Statement 3 and Statement 4, they both cannot be true because Statement 5 says only one of them can be true. However, if exactly 6 statements are true, then Statement 3 is false (since it says exactly 4 are true), and Statement 4 is also false (since it says exactly 3 are false, implying 4 are true). But this creates a problem because we need exactly one false statement. If Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 could potentially be true, but then we'd have a contradiction because we'd have more than one false statement if we try to satisfy other conditions. Let's directly check the statements.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the statements for the condition where exactly 6 are true.\nLet's directly check: If Statement 2 is true and 6 statements are true, the false statement cannot be Statement 1 (since at least 2 are true), Statement 2 (since it's true), or Statement 6 (since 6 is not prime). Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true. If Statement 3 is false, then Statement 4 could be true (and Statement 5 is true because one of them is true and the other is false), making Statement 3 the false one. So, we have: Statement 1 (T), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (F), Statement 4 (T), Statement 5 (T), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (T). Here, Statement 7 says the number of false statements (1) is composite, which is false. So, this configuration doesn't work because Statement 7 is actually false when there's 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false.\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 both say there are 4 true statements, they cannot both be true. Statement 5 is true if one of them is true and the other is false. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 7: Check the scenario where Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 4 being false supports Statement 5 being true. So, we have at least 3 true statements (Statement 3, Statement 5, and potentially others). Let's see if we can satisfy all conditions with exactly 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 8: Examine the possibility of exactly 4 true statements.\nIf exactly 4 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true (since at least 2 are true), Statement 3 is true (by assumption), and Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is false). Statement 6 says the number of true statements is prime; 4 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite; with 3 false statements, it's true because 3 is not composite. Statement 2 is false because it says at most 1 statement is false. Statement 4 is false by our assumption. So, we have: Statement 1 (T), Statement 2 (F), Statement 3 (T), Statement 4 (F), Statement 5 (T), Statement 6 (F), Statement 7 (T). This gives us 4 true statements, satisfying Statement 3.\n\n## Step 9: Verify if the configuration satisfies all given conditions.\nWith Statement 1 (T), Statement 2 (F), Statement 3 (T), Statement 4 (F), Statement 5 (T), Statement 6 (F), and Statement 7 (T), we have 4 true statements. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 7. It does not satisfy Statement 2, Statement 4, or Statement 6, which is consistent with our count of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 10: Count the number of possible solutions.\nWe've found one valid configuration. Let's check for others.\n\n## Step 11: Check for other possible configurations based on the number of true statements.\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 5 is prime, so it actually supports being true. Let's examine: If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements must be prime. 5 is prime, so it's a possible number of true statements. However, we need to check the statements. For 5 true statements, Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7 need to be among the true ones because they can be satisfied with 5 true statements (Statement 7 is true because 2 is composite).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

If this statement is true, then it must be one of the true statements, supporting the idea that there are at least 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means there are exactly 4 true statements, which is the same condition as Statement 3.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (4 true statements), Statement 5 cannot be true because it demands that only one of them is true, but they are equivalent.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime means it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite could be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements could be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the statements\nLet's examine the possibilities based on the number of true statements:\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at least 6 statements are true. This would mean Statement 1, Statement 2, and at least 4 other statements are true, which is possible only if all 7 statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 7 because if all 7 are true, then 0 are false, and 0 is not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Check the validity of Statement 2 being true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then 6 or 7 statements are true. If 7 are true, it contradicts Statement 7. So, let's check if 6 can be true. For 6 statements to be true, Statement 2 being one of them, Statement 1 must also be true. Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true would mean 4 true statements, which contradicts having 6 true statements. Thus, having 6 true statements is challenging because it requires Statement 5 to be false (since Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true), and Statement 6 to be true (since 6 is not prime, this is a problem).\n\n## Step 11: Examine the case where Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply 4 true statements. If 4 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 3 is not composite, this statement is false). So, we have Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 7 as potentially true. However, Statement 7 is false when there are 4 true statements (3 false statements are not composite).\n\n## Step 12: Check for consistency with 4 true statements\nWith 4 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (because there are 3 false statements), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (3 is not composite). So, we have Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4 as true. This gives us 3 true statements so far, and we need one more. Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are false. This scenario is plausible because it satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true) is not satisfied with just 3 true, so it's not valid.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the number of true statements based on prime (Statement 6)\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). We've already seen issues with 7 and 6 true statements. Let's check other primes.\n\n## Step 14: Check for 5 true statements\nIf there are 5 true statements, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (2 is prime, not composite). So, we have a potential set: Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7, and one more. This could work if we pick the right statements.\n\n## Step 15: Detailed check for 5 true statements\nFor 5 true statements: Let's assume Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true. Statement 1 being true supports 5 true statements. Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. If Statement 3 is true, it contradicts having 5 true statements. If Statement 4 is true, it also contradicts. So, one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be the fifth true statement, which is not possible because it would make Statement 5 false. Thus, the fifth true statement cannot be Statement 3 or Statement 4. Statement 2 is the remaining option to be considered for being false, which fits.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

We need to analyze each statement and determine the possible number of true statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This means the number of true statements (T) is $T \\geq 4$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T \\geq 6$ because if at most 1 statement is false, then at least 6 must be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' So, $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means $T = 4$ because if 3 out of 7 statements are false, then 4 are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, they are essentially saying the same thing, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false if they are both true or both false. Thus, Statement 5 can only be true if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The number of false statements is $7 - T$. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $7 - T = 4$ or $6$, implying $T = 3$ or $1$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the conditions together\nLet's examine the possible values of $T$ based on the statements:\n- From Statement 2, $T \\geq 6$. This is very restrictive.\n- Statement 1 is less restrictive than Statement 2 but still implies $T \\geq 4$.\n- Statements 3 and 4 both imply $T = 4$.\n- Statement 5 being true requires both Statements 3 and 4 to be false, implying $T \\neq 4$.\n- Statement 6 implies $T$ is prime (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- Statement 7 implies $T = 3$ or $1$.\n\n## Step 10: Check for consistency with Statement 2\nGiven Statement 2 implies $T \\geq 6$, the only values that satisfy this are $T = 6$ or $T = 7$. Let's check these against the other statements.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate $T = 6$ and $T = 7$\n- For $T = 7$, all statements must be true. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false because both 3 and 4 are false, Statement 6 is true because 7 is prime, and Statement 7 is true because 0 (the number of false statements) is not considered composite. However, Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false contradicts Statement 5 being false since Statement 5 is true if both 3 and 4 are false. So, $T = 7$ is not a valid solution because it makes Statement 5 true, which is consistent, but we need to check all statements.\n- For $T = 6$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is false (because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 1 is not composite). Here, Statement 6 being false is a problem because it contradicts $T = 6$.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed check for $T = 7$\nLet's verify if $T = 7$ is a solution:\n- Statement 1: True because 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2: True because 0 statements are false.\n- Statement 3: False because not exactly 4 are true.\n- Statement 4: False because not exactly 3 are false.\n- Statement 5: True because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Statement 6: True because 7 is prime.\n- Statement 7: True because 0 is not composite.\n\n## Step 13: Check the validity of $T = 7$\nAll statements are true for $T = 7$, and it satisfies the conditions of Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. Statement 3 and 4 are false, which is consistent with Statement 5 being true.\n\n## Step 14: Check for $T = 6$\nFor $T = 6$:\n- Statements 1, 2, 5, and 7 are true.\n- Statement 3 and 4 are false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime.\n\nThis configuration makes 6 statements true and 1 false, which is consistent with Statement 2 and Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite, Statement 7 is actually false). So, $T = 6$ is not valid upon closer inspection because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 15: Evaluate other possible $T$ values based on other statements\nGiven the constraints, let's directly assess the feasibility of other $T$ values:\n- $T = 4$ is suggested by Statements 3 and 4. If $T = 4$, then Statements 1, 3, and 4 are true. Statement 2 is false, Statement 5 is false because both 3 and 4 are true, Statement 6 is true (since 4 is not prime, this is actually false), and Statement 7 is true (since 3 is not composite, this is false). So, $T = 4$ is not a valid solution.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means that at least 6 out of 7 statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, then the number of true statements is either 6 or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 2 being true\nIf Statement 2 is true, and at least 6 statements are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 4 statements are true.\n- For Statement 3 to be true, exactly 4 statements must be true, which contradicts Statement 2 being true. So, Statement 3 must be false if Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 4 being true means exactly 3 statements are false, which again contradicts Statement 2. So, Statement 4 must also be false.\n- Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 is false because it requires exactly one of them to be true.\n- Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements is prime. If 6 statements are true, it's not prime; if 7 statements are true, it's prime.\n- Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements is composite.

Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite, but this needs checking. Actually, 3 is prime, not composite, so Statement 7 is false. This gives us a potential configuration.\n\n## Step 7: Check the configuration for 4 true statements\nFor 4 true statements: Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4 are true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 is false. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4 true, and the rest false. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 for different numbers of true statements\nFor a number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6), it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), it could be 4, 6, or other composite numbers.\n\n## Step 9: Check for other possible configurations\nLet's directly analyze the statements for consistency:\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false). Statement 6 is true (because 5 is prime). Statement 7 is false (because 2 is not composite). This configuration is possible.\n\n## Step 10: Summarize possible configurations\nWe found potential configurations:\n- One where 4 statements are true (Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4 true).\n- One where 5 statements are true (Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 6 true, and Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 7 false).\n\n## Step 11: Verify the configurations\nFor 4 true statements: Statements 1, 3, 4 are true; Statements 2, 5, 6, 7 are false. This is a valid configuration.\nFor 5 true statements: Statements 1, 5, 6 are true; Statements 2, 3, 4, 7 are false. This is also a valid configuration.\n\n## Step 12: Check for other valid configurations\nLet's check other possibilities like 3 true statements or other numbers.\n\n## Step 13: Analyze the case for 3 true statements\nIf 3 statements are true, Statement 1 is false because it requires at least 4 true statements.

This implies that the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 4.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 3, or equivalently, T is greater than or equal to 4.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies T = 2.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies T = 0.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, and vice versa.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, F can be 4, 6 (since 4 and 6 are composite numbers), implying T can be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2\nBoth Statement 1 and Statement 2 imply that T \u2265 4. If T \u2265 4, then both statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says T = 2, and Statement 4 says T = 0. Both cannot be true because they imply different values for T.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true (T = 2), then Statement 4 is false (T \u2260 0). If Statement 4 is true (T = 0), then Statement 3 is false (T \u2260 2). We need to check the validity of Statement 5 under different scenarios.\n\n## Step 5: Check the consistency of the statements\nLet's analyze the possible values of T based on the statements.\n- If T = 0 (Statement 4 is true), then Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. However, T = 0 contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n- If T = 2 (Statement 3 is true), then Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false because T < 4.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the implications of Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 implies T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7). Statement 7 implies F is composite, so T = 3 or T = 1.\n\n## Step 7: Check for possible values of T that satisfy multiple statements\nLet's directly evaluate the statements for possible T values.\n- For T = 7, Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true. Statement 4 is false, and Statement 3 is false, making Statement 5 true. Statement 7 is false because F = 0 is not composite.\n- For T = 5, Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true. Statement 7 is true because F = 2 is not composite, so this T doesn't satisfy Statement 7.\n- For T = 3, Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is true because F = 4 is composite. Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is false.\n- For T = 2, Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 is true. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false.\n\n## Step 8: Detailed analysis for T = 2, T = 3, T = 5, and T = 7\n- For T = 2: Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 is true. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false. Statement 4 is false, making Statement 5 true. Statement 7 is false because F = 5 is not composite. So, T = 2 has 3 true statements (Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6), which contradicts T = 2.\n- For T = 3: Statement 6 and Statement 7 are true. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false. Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. So, T = 3 has 2 true statements (Statement 6, Statement 7), which contradicts T = 3.\n- For T = 5: Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true. Statement 7 is false. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, making Statement 5 true. So, T = 5 has 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6), which contradicts T = 5.\n- For T = 7: All statements are true, which is impossible because Statement 4 says all are false.\n\n## Step 9: Checking the validity of each possible T\nLet's directly check the statements for consistency.\n- For T = 2: Statements 3, 5, and 6 are true. This gives T = 3, which is inconsistent.\n- For T = 3: Statements 6 and 7 are true. This scenario is plausible because it doesn't directly contradict the count of true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed check for T = 3\nIf T = 3, then Statements 6 and 7 are true. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false. For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, it matches T = 3 (Statement 3 is about T = 2, so it's actually false), and if Statement 4 is true, it contradicts T = 3. So, we have to see which statements can be true when T = 3.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which means 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This is equivalent to Statement 1.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true,' and Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false,' which implies 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. This would mean Statement 3 is one of them, and the other true statement could be any one of the remaining 6. However, Statement 4 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true. If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which creates a paradox because Statement 4 itself would be false.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the implications of Statement 5\nStatement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements. If Statement 4 is true, it leads to a contradiction because it asserts all statements are false, including itself.\n\n## Step 6: Assess the validity of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then it must be false because it claims all statements are false. Thus, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 7: Consider Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. Given Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, we have at least 2 true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 5). We need to check if there's exactly one more true statement.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the number of true statements based on Statement 1 and Statement 2\nBoth Statement 1 and Statement 2 imply that at least 4 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then it contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2 because they require at least 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 3 together\nSince Statement 3 being true contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2, and both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are equivalent, we need to check the scenarios where Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true or false.\n\n## Step 10: Check for possible numbers of true statements\nLet's directly check the possible numbers of true statements and see which satisfy all given conditions. Statement 1 and Statement 2 being true means at least 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 11: Examine the case when at least 4 statements are true\nIf at least 4 statements are true, then Statement 3 is false because it claims exactly 2 are true. Statement 4 is also false as established. Statement 5's truth value depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4; since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. If there are at least 4 true statements, possible numbers are 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 13: Check the prime number condition for true statements\nFor 4 true statements, it's not prime. For 5 true statements, it's prime. For 6 true statements, it's not prime. For 7 true statements, it's not prime.\n\n## Step 14: Check the composite number condition for false statements\nFor 4 true statements, there are 3 false statements, which is not composite. For 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements, which is not composite. For 6 true statements, there is 1 false statement, which is not composite. For 7 true statements, there are 0 false statements, which is not considered composite.\n\n## Step 15: Evaluate the conditions together\nGiven that Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true, we have at least 4 true statements. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. So, we have at least 2 true statements (Statement 1 and Statement 2), and Statement 6 and Statement 7 need to be evaluated based on the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 16: Assess possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\nIf there are 5 true statements, then Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 being true satisfies the condition of having at least 4 true statements. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 17: Check if having 5 true statements satisfies all conditions\nWith 5 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and two others), Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 7 are false. This gives us a valid configuration: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6 true, and the rest false, or other combinations that give 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 18: Verify the configurations\nLet's verify if having Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 true (3 true so far) can be extended to 5 true statements. We need 2 more true statements. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 7 is false with 2 false statements. So, we can have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and any other statement being true is not valid due to the constraints.\n\n## Step 19: Finalize the number of possible solutions\nLet's directly analyze the feasible configurations based on previous steps.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements.\n- Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 4.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 3, or equivalently, T is greater than or equal to 4.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies T = 2.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies T = 0.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This statement's truth value depends on the truth values of Statements 3 and 4.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, F being composite means F = 4, 6 (since F = 7 is not possible as it contradicts the definition of T and F).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2\nBoth Statement 1 and Statement 2 imply that T \u2265 4. They are equivalent in meaning because if T \u2265 4, then F \u2264 3.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 (T = 2) and Statement 4 (T = 0) cannot both be true because they imply different numbers of true statements. Statement 5's truth value hinges on exactly one of them being true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the truth value of Statement 5\nFor Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true (T = 2), then Statement 4 is false. If Statement 4 is true (T = 0), then Statement 3 is false. We need to check the validity of Statement 5 under different scenarios.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the possible truth values based on Statement 1 and Statement 2\nGiven that both Statement 1 and Statement 2 suggest T \u2265 4, we can infer that Statement 3 (T = 2) and Statement 4 (T = 0) are false because they contradict the condition T \u2265 4.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate Statement 5 with the knowledge that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nSince both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 is false because it requires exactly one of them to be true.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the number of true statements based on the given conditions\nWith Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false, and Statement 5 being false, we have at least 3 false statements. Statement 1 and Statement 2 being true implies T \u2265 4. So, we have T \u2265 4 and F \u2265 3.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the conditions from Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 implies that T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7). Given T \u2265 4 from Statement 1 and Statement 2, T could be 5 or 7. Statement 7 implies F is composite, so F = 4 or 6 (since F = 7 is not possible).\n\n## Step 9: Check for consistency among the statements\n- If T = 5, then F = 2, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. This gives us T = 5, F = 2.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0, which is not composite (0 is not considered composite), so Statement 7 is false. This gives us T = 7, F = 0.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the consistency of T = 5 and T = 7 with all statements\n- For T = 5: Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true. Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5 are false. Statement 7 is false because F = 2 is not composite. So, we have 3 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6) and 4 false statements, which contradicts T = 5.\n- For T = 7: All statements are true. However, Statement 4 says all statements are false, which is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed check for T = 5\nLet's directly check the statements for T = 5.\n- Statement 1 is true because T = 5 \u2265 4.\n- Statement 2 is true because F = 2 \u2264 3.\n- Statement 3 is false because T \u2260 2.\n- Statement 4 is false because T \u2260 0.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Statement 6 is true because T = 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because F = 2 is not composite.\n\nThis results in T = 3 ( Statements 1, 2, and 6 are true), which contradicts our assumption of T = 5.\n\n## Step 12: Re-evaluate the conditions and directly check possible values of T\nLet's directly assess possible values for T that satisfy all given conditions and check for consistency.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Statement 7 implies F is composite, so T = 3 or T = 1.\n\n## Step 7: Check for possible values of T that satisfy multiple statements\nLet's directly evaluate the statements for possible T values.\n- For T = 7, Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true. Statement 4 is false, and Statement 3 is false, making Statement 5 true. Statement 7 is false because F = 0 is not composite.\n- For T = 5, Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true. Statement 7 is true because F = 2 is not composite, so this T doesn't satisfy Statement 7.\n- For T = 3, Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is true because F = 4 is composite. Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is false.\n- For T = 2, Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 is true. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false.\n\n## Step 8: Detailed analysis for T = 2, T = 3, T = 5, and T = 7\n- For T = 2: Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 is true. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false. Statement 4 is false, making Statement 5 true. Statement 7 is false because F = 5 is not composite. So, T = 2 has 3 true statements (Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6), which contradicts T = 2.\n- For T = 3: Statement 6 and Statement 7 are true. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false. Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. So, T = 3 has 2 true statements (Statement 6, Statement 7), which contradicts T = 3.\n- For T = 5: Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true. Statement 7 is false. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, making Statement 5 true. So, T = 5 has 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6), which contradicts T = 5.\n- For T = 7: All statements are true, which is impossible because Statement 4 says all are false.\n\n## Step 9: Checking the validity of each possible T\nLet's directly check the statements for consistency.\n- For T = 2: Statements 3, 5, and 6 are true. This gives T = 3, which is inconsistent.\n- For T = 3: Statements 6 and 7 are true. This scenario is plausible because it doesn't directly contradict the count of true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed check for T = 3\nIf T = 3, then Statements 6 and 7 are true.

Statement 1: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' implies that the number of true statements is 2 or more. Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' implies that the number of true statements is 4 or more. Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' directly states the number of true statements. Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' implies that exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' implies that one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true and the other is false. Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' implies that the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7. Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' implies that the number of false statements is 4, 6, or other composite numbers less than or equal to 7, but since there are 7 statements, it means 1, 3, or 0 true statements would satisfy this (because 3, 1, or 0 false statements are not composite, the valid numbers for false statements are 4 or 6, implying 3 or 1 true statements).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' and Statement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' which means 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Both statements essentially say the same thing, that 4 statements are true. Statement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 must be false because it demands that only one of them is true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 5 being false.\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we have to consider the implications. Both Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or both being false are the possibilities. If both are true, it means 4 statements are true. If both are false, then the number of true statements is not 4.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the case when both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then 4 statements are true. This makes Statement 1 true (since at least 2 are true), Statement 2 true (since at most 3 are false, meaning at least 4 are true), and Statement 5 is false. So, we have Statement 1, 2, 3, 4 as true, and Statement 5 as false. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is prime; 4 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite; with 3 false statements, this is true because 3 is not composite but Statement 7 refers to the number of false statements being composite, and 3 is not composite. So, the statements being true are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 is false because 3 is not composite. This gives us 4 true statements. Let's correct the assessment: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 3 is not composite). So, we actually have 4 true statements, which matches Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the number of true statements satisfies all conditions when 4 statements are true.\nWe have 4 true statements (1, 2, 3, 4) and 3 false statements (5, 6, 7). Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false. Statement 3 is true because exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 4 is true because exactly 3 statements are false (or 4 are true). Statement 5 is false, which is correct. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. This scenario is consistent.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the case when both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\nIf both are false, then the number of true statements is not 4. Statement 1 being true implies at least 2 true statements. Statement 2 being true implies at least 4 true statements, which contradicts our assumption that the number of true statements is not 4 unless it's more than 4. Let's analyze further.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze possible numbers of true statements based on the statements.\nGiven Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime), possible numbers are 2, 3, 5, or 7. Given Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite), possible numbers of false statements are 4 or 6, implying 3 or 1 true statements. Statement 1 supports 2 or more true statements. Statement 2 supports 4 or more true statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check for consistency across all statements for different numbers of true statements.\nFor 2 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (2 is prime), but Statement 2 is false (since 5 false statements are more than 3), and Statement 7 is true (5 is not composite, so this doesn't fit). For 3 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), Statement 7 is true (4 is composite), and Statement 2 is false. For 5 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite). For 7 true statements: All statements must be true, which is impossible because Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the scenarios based on prime and composite conditions.\nFor 3 true statements: Statements 1, 6, and 7 can be true. Statement 3 and 4 are false, which makes Statement 5 true. So, we have a possible scenario: Statements 1, 5, 6, 7 are true, and Statements 2, 3, 4 are false. This gives us 4 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption of 3 true statements. Let's directly check the validity of different true statement counts.\n\n## Step 10: Summarize the findings.\nWe've established one valid scenario where 4 statements are true. Let's directly assess the validity of the statements for different counts of true statements and check for any other possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' directly states the number of true statements. Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' implies that exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' implies that one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true and the other is false. Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' implies that the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7. Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' implies that the number of false statements is 4, 6, or other composite numbers less than or equal to 7, but since there are 7 statements, it means 1, 3, or 0 true statements would satisfy this (because 3, 1, or 0 false statements are not composite, the valid numbers for false statements are 4 or 6, implying 3 or 1 true statements).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' and Statement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' which means 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Both statements essentially say the same thing, that 4 statements are true. Statement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 must be false because it demands that only one of them is true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 5 being false.\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we have to consider the implications. Both Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or both being false are the possibilities. If both are true, it means 4 statements are true. If both are false, then the number of true statements is not 4.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the case when both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then 4 statements are true. This makes Statement 1 true (since at least 2 are true), Statement 2 true (since at most 3 are false, meaning at least 4 are true), and Statement 5 is false. So, we have Statement 1, 2, 3, 4 as true, and Statement 5 as false. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is prime; 4 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite; with 3 false statements, this is true because 3 is not composite but Statement 7 refers to the number of false statements being composite, and 3 is not composite. So, the statements being true are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 is false because 3 is not composite. This gives us 4 true statements. Let's correct the assessment: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 3 is not composite). So, we actually have 4 true statements, which matches Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the number of true statements satisfies all conditions when 4 statements are true.\nWe have 4 true statements (1, 2, 3, 4) and 3 false statements (5, 6, 7). Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false. Statement 3 is true because exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 4 is true because exactly 3 statements are false (or 4 are true). Statement 5 is false, which is correct. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. This scenario is consistent.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the case when both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\nIf both are false, then the number of true statements is not 4. Statement 1 being true implies at least 2 true statements. Statement 2 being true implies at least 4 true statements, which contradicts our assumption that the number of true statements is not 4 unless it's more than 4. Let's analyze further.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze possible numbers of true statements based on the statements.\nGiven Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime), possible numbers are 2, 3, 5, or 7. Given Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite), possible numbers of false statements are 4 or 6, implying 3 or 1 true statements. Statement 1 supports 2 or more true statements. Statement 2 supports 4 or more true statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check for consistency across all statements for different numbers of true statements.\nFor 2 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (2 is prime), but Statement 2 is false (since 5 false statements are more than 3), and Statement 7 is true (5 is not composite, so this doesn't fit). For 3 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), Statement 7 is true (4 is composite), and Statement 2 is false. For 5 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite). For 7 true statements: All statements must be true, which is impossible because Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the scenarios based on prime and composite conditions.\nFor 3 true statements: Statements 1, 6, and 7 can be true. Statement 3 and 4 are false, which makes Statement 5 true. So, we have a possible scenario: Statements 1, 5, 6, 7 are true, and Statements 2, 3, 4 are false. This gives us 4 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption of 3 true statements. Let's directly check the validity of different true statement counts.\n\n## Step 10: Summarize the findings.\nWe've established one valid scenario where 4 statements are true. Let's directly assess the validity of the statements for different counts of true statements and check for any other possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' We need to understand that Statement 2 is equivalent to saying 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true' because if at most 3 are false, then at least 4 are true.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify and compare statements\nLet's simplify the statements. Statement 1 implies there are at least 2 true statements. Statement 2 implies there are at least 4 true statements. Statement 3 implies there are exactly 4 true statements. Statement 4 implies there are exactly 4 true statements (since 3 false means 4 true). Statement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which is a contradiction because Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing, making it impossible for Statement 5 to be true if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are considered. However, we should directly examine the implications of the statements being true or false.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 state that there are 4 true statements. Thus, they cannot be simultaneously true, making Statement 5 false because it requires one of them to be true and the other false, but they are essentially the same.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then there are 4 true statements. Statement 4 being true would mean the same. However, since they cannot both be true, we have to consider the scenarios where one or both are false.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the scenario when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both false\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, it means there are not exactly 4 true statements. Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, would be false because both are false. So, we have at least 3 statements (Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5) that are false.\n\n## Step 6: Assess the implications of Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7\nStatement 1 being true means at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 being true means at least 4 statements are true. Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements is prime. Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements is composite.\n\n## Step 7: Check for possible numbers of true statements based on given conditions\nLet's consider the number of true statements (T) and false statements (F). T + F = 7. Statement 2 implies T >= 4. If T = 4, then F = 3, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. Statement 6 implies T is prime, so T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Examine possible values for T that satisfy multiple conditions\nFor T = 4 (as implied by Statement 3 and Statement 4), it's not prime, so Statement 6 is false. For T = 5, F = 2, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. For T = 7, F = 0, which is not composite (by definition, a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the case when T = 4\nIf T = 4, then Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are true. But this contradicts Statement 5 being true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true. So, Statement 5 must be false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 4 true, and Statements 5, 6, 7 false, which gives us 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Check if T = 4 satisfies all given statements\nFor T = 4, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both 3 and 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (because 3 is not composite). This configuration is possible.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate other potential values of T\nFor T = 5, Statements 1, 2, 6 are true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true because one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is not true (both are false). Statement 7 is false. So, T = 5 gives us Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 true, and Statements 3, 4, 7 false, totaling 4 true statements, which does not match T = 5.\n\n## Step 12: Check the validity of T = 5\nLet's directly check: If T = 5, then F = 2. Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true. This gives 4 true statements, not 5, so it's not valid for T = 5.\n\n## Step 13: Consider T = 2 and T = 3\nFor T = 2 or T = 3, Statement 2 is false. For T = 2, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. For T = 3, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime.\n\n## Step 14: Analyze the case for T = 3\nIf T = 3, then F = 4, which is composite. So, Statement 7 is true. We need to find 3 true statements that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' We need to understand what each statement implies about the number of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 implies that there are 4 true statements and 3 false statements. Statement 4 implies that there are 4 true statements (since 3 are false) and 3 false statements. Both statements essentially convey the same information about the number of true and false statements, which means they cannot be simultaneously true or false under different conditions without contradicting each other.\n\n## Step 3: Examine Statement 5's implication on Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, as established, both statements convey the same truth condition (4 true, 3 false), making it impossible for one to be true and the other false because they are equivalent in terms of the truth count they imply. Thus, Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 3 and Statement 4 are considered.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 together.\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, they are either both true or both false. If both are true, then Statement 5 is false because it claims only one of them can be true. If both are false, then Statement 5 is still false because it requires exactly one of them to be true.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the conditions under which Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 can be true or false.\nLet's denote the number of true statements as T and the number of false statements as F. Thus, T + F = 7.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the conditions of each statement to possible values of T and F.\n- Statement 1: T \u2265 2.\n- Statement 2: F \u2264 3, so T \u2265 4.\n- Statement 3: T = 4.\n- Statement 4: F = 3, so T = 4.\n- Statement 5: As discussed, it's problematic because Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent.\n- Statement 6: T is a prime number. Possible values for T are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n- Statement 7: F is a composite number. Possible values for F are 4, 6.\n\n## Step 7: Check for possible values of T that satisfy multiple statements.\nFrom Statement 2, T \u2265 4. So, possible T values are 4, 5, 6, 7. But from Statement 6, T must be prime, so T can be 5 or 7 (since 4 is not prime and 6 is not prime).\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the case when T = 4 (as per Statement 3 and Statement 4).\nIf T = 4, then F = 3. Statement 1 is true (since 4 \u2265 2), Statement 2 is true (since 3 \u2264 3), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 3 is not composite). So, we have 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4) and 3 false statements (Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7), which satisfies T = 4.\n\n## Step 9: Check if T = 5 is a valid solution.\nIf T = 5, then F = 2. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true (since F = 2 \u2264 3), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, making the condition \"either...or\" true), Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). So, we have 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6) and 3 false statements, which does not match T = 5.\n\n## Step 10: Check if T = 7 is a valid solution.\nIf T = 7, then F = 0. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false. So, we have 5 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and one more is needed but Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), which doesn't fit.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluate the findings for valid solutions.\nFor T = 4 (and F = 3), we have a valid configuration where Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 are true, and Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are false. This satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 12: Summarize the possible solutions based on the analysis.\nWe've found that T = 4 is a possible solution where 4 statements are true and 3 are false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze the given statements. We have 7 statements regarding the truthfulness of the statements themselves. Statement 1 claims at least 4 are true, Statement 2 claims at most 7 are false (meaning at least 0 are true), Statement 3 claims exactly 4 are true, Statement 4 claims exactly 3 are false (meaning exactly 4 are true), Statement 5 claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number, and Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 both claim that exactly 4 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is also true because they both assert the same condition (exactly 4 true statements). However, Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This implies that if Statement 5 is true, then both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true, creating a contradiction.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 5\nGiven the contradiction found in Step 2 when assuming Statement 5 is true, we must examine the implications. If Statement 5 is true, it leads to a contradiction because Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent. Thus, Statement 5 must be false because it cannot be true without causing a contradiction.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the implications of Statement 5 being false\nWith Statement 5 being false, Statement 3 and Statement 4 must either both be true or both be false. If both are true, it means exactly 4 statements are true. If both are false, it means the number of true statements is not exactly 4.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the case when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then exactly 4 statements are true. This means Statement 1 is true because at least 4 statements are true. Statement 2 is also true because at most 7 statements are false (and 3 are false, which is less than 7). So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 as true. This gives us 4 true statements. Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is prime; 4 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is composite; there are 3 false statements, and 3 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. Thus, we have 4 true (Statement 1, 2, 3, 4) and 3 false (Statement 5, 6, 7) statements, which satisfies the conditions of Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 6: Verify if the condition satisfies all true statements\nWith 4 true statements (Statement 1, 2, 3, 4) and 3 false statements (Statement 5, 6, 7), we verify: Statement 1 is true because 4 out of 7 are true. Statement 2 is true because 3 out of 7 are false, which is less than 7. Statement 3 is true as exactly 4 are true. Statement 4 is true as exactly 3 are false. This configuration is valid.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the case when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both false\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not exactly 4. This implies that the number of true statements is either less than 4 or more than 4. If less than 4, Statement 1 is false. If more than 4, Statement 1 could be true or false depending on the exact number.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the scenario when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false and Statement 1 is false\nIf Statement 1 is false, then fewer than 4 statements are true. This means 3 or fewer statements are true. Let's examine if this can be valid. Statement 2 being true means at most 7 are false, so at least 0 are true, which is always true. If 3 or fewer statements are true, Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) could be true if the number of true statements is 2 or 3 (since 2 and 3 are prime).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate possible configurations when fewer than 4 statements are true\nLet's consider the case where exactly 3 statements are true. For Statement 6 to be true (since 3 is prime), we need exactly 3 true statements. Possible combinations need to be checked against all statements.\n\n## Step 10: Check for valid configurations\nFor exactly 3 true statements: Statement 2 is always true because it says at most 7 are false. If Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true, then Statement 2 being true is valid. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements (4 in this case) must be composite, which it is. So, one valid configuration is Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 being true.\n\n## Step 11: Validate the configuration for exactly 3 true statements\nWith Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 being true, we have 3 true statements. Statement 1 is false because not at least 4 are true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false because they claim exactly 4 true statements. Statement 5 is false because it claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and both are false. This configuration is valid.\n\n## Step 12: Summarize the valid configurations found\nWe have found at least two valid configurations: one with exactly 4 true statements (Statement 1, 2, 3, 4 true) and one with exactly 3 true statements (Statement 2, 6, 7 true).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

If both are true, it means exactly 4 statements are true. If both are false, it means the number of true statements is not exactly 4.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the case when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then exactly 4 statements are true. This means Statement 1 is true because at least 4 statements are true. Statement 2 is also true because at most 7 statements are false (and 3 are false, which is less than 7). So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 as true. This gives us 4 true statements. Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is prime; 4 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is composite; there are 3 false statements, and 3 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.

Statement 2 is true because 3 out of 7 are false, which is less than 7. Statement 3 is true as exactly 4 are true. Statement 4 is true as exactly 3 are false. This configuration is valid.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the case when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both false\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not exactly 4. This implies that the number of true statements is either less than 4 or more than 4. If less than 4, Statement 1 is false. If more than 4, Statement 1 could be true or false depending on the exact number.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the scenario when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false and Statement 1 is false\nIf Statement 1 is false, then fewer than 4 statements are true. This means 3 or fewer statements are true. Let's examine if this can be valid. Statement 2 being true means at most 7 are false, so at least 0 are true, which is always true. If 3 or fewer statements are true, Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) could be true if the number of true statements is 2 or 3 (since 2 and 3 are prime).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate possible configurations when fewer than 4 statements are true\nLet's consider the case where exactly 3 statements are true. For Statement 6 to be true (since 3 is prime), we need exactly 3 true statements. Possible combinations need to be checked against all statements.\n\n## Step 10: Check for valid configurations\nFor exactly 3 true statements: Statement 2 is always true because it says at most 7 are false. If Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true, then Statement 2 being true is valid. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements (4 in this case) must be composite, which it is.

Statement 1 is false because not at least 4 are true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false because they claim exactly 4 true statements. Statement 5 is false because it claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and both are false.

This means the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 4.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that at most 7 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 7. Since there are 7 statements in total, F \u2264 7 is always true because F cannot exceed 7. Thus, Statement 2 is always true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 asserts that exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true. This gives us a specific condition: T = 4.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false. Since there are 7 statements, this implies T = 7 - 3 = 4. Thus, Statement 4 is equivalent to Statement 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, from Step 3 and Step 4, we know Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false. Thus, Statement 5 must be false because it demands that one of the equivalent statements is true and the other is false.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the Implications of Statement 5 Being False\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we have to consider the truth values of Statement 3 and Statement 4. Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, they must either both be true or both be false.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. For 7 statements, T being prime means T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, F being composite means F could be 4 or 6 because these are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 9: Examine Possible Scenarios Based on Statement 1 and Statement 3/Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 (and thus Statement 4) is true, then T = 4. This satisfies Statement 1. We need to check if this scenario is consistent with other statements.\n\n## Step 10: Check Consistency When T = 4\nIf T = 4, then F = 3. Statement 1 is true because T \u2265 4. Statement 2 is true as F \u2264 7. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true because T = 4. Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our earlier deduction. Statement 6 is false because T = 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because F = 3 is not composite. So, we have T = 4, and the true statements are 1, 2, 3, and 4, which is a valid scenario.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate Other Possible Values of T Based on Statement 6\nFor T = 2, 3, 5, or 7 (from Statement 6), we check if any satisfy all given conditions. T = 2 implies F = 5, which makes Statement 7 false because 5 is not composite. T = 3 implies F = 4, making Statement 7 true because 4 is composite. T = 5 implies F = 2, making Statement 7 false. T = 7 implies F = 0, making Statement 7 false.\n\n## Step 12: Check Consistency for T = 3\nIf T = 3, then F = 4. Statement 1 is false because T < 4. Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, satisfying its condition. Statement 6 is true because T = 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because F = 4 is composite. So, Statements 2, 5, 6, and 7 are true, which gives T = 4, contradicting our assumption of T = 3.\n\n## Step 13: Check Consistency for T = 5 and T = 7\nFor T = 5, F = 2. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is false. This gives us 4 true statements (1, 2, 5, 6), which matches our initial condition for T = 4 but here T = 5. For T = 7, all statements must be true, but this leads to a contradiction because Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true.\n\n## Step 14: Summarize Findings\nWe found that when T = 4, we have a valid solution where Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are true.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements.\n- Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 4.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 7. Since there are 7 statements, this is always true because F cannot exceed 7.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies T = 4.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies F = 3, hence T = 4 because T + F = 7.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 both imply T = 4, they are essentially saying the same thing, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false if they are both true or both false. Thus, Statement 5 can only be true if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For F, the composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nSince Statement 2 is 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false,' it is always true because the maximum number of false statements cannot exceed 7. Thus, Statement 2 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4\n- If Statement 3 is true, then T = 4. This makes Statement 4 true as well because T = 4 implies F = 3.\n- Statement 1 is true if T \u2265 4. So, if T = 4, Statement 1 is true.\n- Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 both being true implies T = 4, we can check if this satisfies other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true\nIf T = 4 (because Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true), then:\n- Statement 1 is true because T = 4 satisfies T \u2265 4.\n- Statement 2 is true as established.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because F = 3 is not composite, but since F = 3, it's not composite, Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 5: Check the consistency of T = 4 with all statements\nLet's count the true statements when T = 4:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: False\n- Statement 6: False\n- Statement 7: False\nSo, T = 4 (4 true statements), which matches the condition given by Statement 3 and Statement 4. This gives us 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 6: Check if T = 4 satisfies the condition of being a possible solution\nFor T = 4:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: False (because both 3 and 4 are true)\n- Statement 6: False (4 is not prime)\n- Statement 7: False (3 is not composite)\nThis configuration gives us 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which is a valid configuration.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 5's impact\nSince Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and we've seen that both can be true, Statement 5 must be false when both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n\n## Step 8: Examine other possible values of T based on Statement 6\nStatement 6 says T is prime. Possible values for T are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- For T = 2, F = 5. Statement 1 is false, Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite.\n- For T = 3, F = 4. Statement 1 is false, Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n- For T = 5, F = 2. Statement 1 is true, Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n- For T = 7, F = 0. Statement 1 is true, Statement 7 is false because 0 is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Check the validity of other T values\nLet's directly assess the validity of different T values considering all statements.\n\n## Step 10: Assess T = 5\nIf T = 5:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: False\n- Statement 5: True (because both 3 and 4 are false)\n- Statement 6: True (5 is prime)\n- Statement 7: False (2 is not composite)\nThis gives 4 true statements, which contradicts our assumption of T = 5.\n\n## Step 11: Assess T = 7\nIf T = 7:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: False\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: True (7 is prime)\n- Statement 7: True (0 is not composite, so this is false)\nThis configuration has 5 true statements, not 7, so it's not valid.\n\n## Step 12: Assess T = 3\nIf T = 3:\n- Statement 1: False\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True (because F = 4)\n- Statement 5: True (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true)\n- Statement 6: True (3 is prime)\n- Statement 7: True (4 is composite)\nThis gives T = 5 (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 being true is not possible because it exceeds 3), so let's correct the count:\n- Statement 1: False\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: True\n- Statement 7: True\nActually, this configuration works because it gives us T = 5, which is not what we assumed. Let's directly check:\nFor T = 3: Statements 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 being true is a valid configuration (2, 4, 5, 6, 7 true) which gives T = 5, not 3. So, T = 3 is not a valid solution upon reevaluation.\n\n## Step 13: Assess T = 2\nIf T = 2:\n- The configuration needs to be checked for validity.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.' implies that not all statements can be false. Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' means that at least 4 statements must be true. Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' and Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' essentially say the same thing since having exactly 3 false statements out of 7 means having exactly 4 true statements. Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' is interesting because it implies that Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true or both be false. Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' suggests that the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7. Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' implies that the number of false statements is not 1 or a prime number, so it could be 0, 4, 6, or any other composite number less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the relationship between Statements 3 and 4.\nSince Statements 3 and 4 say the same thing (exactly 4 statements are true), they are either both true or both false. Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which creates a contradiction if we assume Statements 3 and 4 are both true or both false. Thus, Statement 5 being true means Statements 3 and 4 must be false because they cannot satisfy the condition of being one true and one false due to their equivalent meaning.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statements 3 and 4 being false.\nIf Statements 3 and 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not exactly 4. This means Statement 5 is true because it correctly identifies that Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the implications of Statement 2 being true.\nStatement 2 being true means at least 4 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, and given that Statements 3 and 4 are false, we need to check the other statements.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the possible number of true statements based on the statements.\nLet's denote the number of true statements as $T$. If $T = 4$, then Statements 3 and 4 would be true, which contradicts our finding. So, $T$ is not 4. Statement 2 being true implies $T \\geq 4$. Thus, possible values for $T$ could be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 6: Check the validity of Statement 1.\nStatement 1 is true if at least one statement is true. Given that we have a scenario where multiple statements could be true, Statement 1 is likely true.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6 and its implications.\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. For $T = 5$ or $T = 7$, this statement is true because both 5 and 7 are prime.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate Statement 7.\nStatement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. If $T = 5$, then the number of false statements is 2, which is not composite. If $T = 7$, then the number of false statements is 0, which is considered composite in some definitions but often not in basic mathematics. If $T = 6$, the number of false statements is 1, which is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Check the consistency of the statements for different values of $T$.\n- For $T = 5$, Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. This gives us 4 true statements, which does not match $T = 5$. So, $T = 5$ is not valid.\n- For $T = 6$, Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. This scenario is plausible because it gives us 5 true statements (1, 2, 5, 6, and potentially another), which does not match $T = 6$. However, we need to check the statements again. If Statement 2 is true, then at most 3 are false, meaning at least 4 are true. Statements 3 and 4 being false is consistent with this. Statement 5 being true is consistent. Statement 6 being true ($T = 6$ is not prime) is false. So, $T = 6$ could be a potential solution if we can satisfy the conditions.\n- For $T = 7$, all statements must be true. However, if all statements are true, then Statements 3 and 4 being true contradicts our initial deduction that they are false due to Statement 5 being true.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed examination for $T = 5$ and $T = 6$ and $T = 7$.\nFor $T = 5$: Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, and one more need to be true. Statement 7 is false. This could potentially work if we have Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 true and Statement 3 or 4 false (which they are), and another statement true. However, having exactly 5 true statements means we have to carefully check which ones can be true. Statements 1, 2, 5 are true. Statement 6 is true if $T = 5$. So, we have at least 4 true statements. To reach $T = 5$, another statement needs to be true.\n\nFor $T = 6$: If 6 statements are true, then Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. So, $T = 6$ is not possible because it requires Statement 6 to be true.\n\nFor $T = 7$: As analyzed, this creates a contradiction because Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true if Statement 5 is true.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for $T = 5$ with the given statements.\nLet's assume $T = 5$. We know Statements 1, 2, 5 are true. For $T = 5$, Statement 6 is true. We need one more true statement. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. So, the true statements could be 1, 2, 5, 6, and potentially another. However, we've established that Statements 3 and 4 are false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze each statement: Statement 1 implies that there is at least one true statement. Statement 2 implies that there are at least 4 true statements (since at most 3 are false). Statement 3 states that exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 4 states that exactly 3 statements are false, which means exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statements 3 and 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 both claim that exactly 4 statements are true. If either is true, the other must be true as well because they both state the same condition (exactly 4 true statements). However, Statement 5 states that exactly one of them should be true, which creates a contradiction if we assume either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 5.\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true if Statement 5 is true, and they cannot both be false because Statement 5 dictates that one of them must be true, we have a contradiction. Thus, if Statement 5 is true, it leads to a contradiction because Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent. Therefore, Statement 5 must be false because it cannot be true without causing a contradiction.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the implications of Statement 5 being false.\nWith Statement 5 being false, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must be true or both false. If both are true, then exactly 4 statements are true. If both are false, then the condition they state (exactly 4 true statements) is not met.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the scenario where both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then exactly 4 statements are true. This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 are true. Statement 5 is false as established. We need to check if Statement 6 and Statement 7 can be true or false under this condition. Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) is false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) is true because there are 3 false statements, and 3 is not composite, it's prime. So, actually, Statement 7 is false. Thus, we have 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4) and 3 false statements (Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7), which satisfies the conditions of Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4.\n\n## Step 6: Check if the condition satisfies all true statements.\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false.\n- Statement 3 is true because exactly 4 statements are true.\n- Statement 4 is true because exactly 3 statements are false (meaning 4 are true).\nThis setup is consistent.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the scenario where both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\nIf both are false, then the number of true statements is not 4. Statement 5 is false, so this condition is met. We need to check other statements. Statement 1 is true because there are true statements. Statement 2's truth depends on the number of false statements. If there are more than 3 false statements, Statement 2 is false.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze possible distributions when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\nLet's consider the number of true statements: If Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, we have at least 2 false statements. Statement 5 is also false, so we have at least 3 false statements. Statement 6 and Statement 7's truth values depend on the total count of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 9: Check for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6).\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime. Possible primes less than 7 are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the number of true and false statements for each possible prime number of true statements.\n- If there are 2 true statements, then 5 are false. Statement 1 is true, Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite. Statement 2 is false because more than 3 are false. So, we have 2 true (Statement 1, Statement 7) and 5 false, which satisfies Statement 6 (2 is prime) and Statement 7 (5 is composite).\n- If there are 3 true statements, then 4 are false. Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime, and Statement 7 is false because 4 is composite. Statement 2 is false. So, we could have Statement 1, Statement 5 (false), and Statement 6 true. But we need to check if this satisfies all conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed check for 3 true statements.\nFor 3 true statements: Statement 1, Statement 6 are true. Statement 2 is false because there are 4 false statements. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false as per our assumption. Statement 5 is false. Statement 7 is false because 4 is composite. So, possible true statements could be Statement 1 and Statement 6, and one more. But we need exactly 3 true, so let's consider: Statement 1 (true), Statement 6 (true), and one of the others. If Statement 2 is the third true, it contradicts because Statement 2 being true means at most 3 false, so at least 4 true. Thus, having exactly 3 true statements with Statement 6 being one of them is not feasible under the given constraints because it leads to contradictions when trying to satisfy Statement 2 or other conditions.\n\n## Step 12: Check the case for 5 true statements.\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. For Statement 6 to be true, 5 must be prime, which it is not. So, this case doesn't satisfy Statement 6.\n\n## Step 13: Summarize possible solutions based on the analysis.\nWe have identified potential scenarios: one where exactly 4 statements are true and another where we have 2 true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This means that at least 4 statements must be true.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This gives a specific count of true statements.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This is equivalent to saying exactly 4 statements are true, similar to Statement 3.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (4 true statements), this statement can never be true because it demands that only one of them is true, but they are equivalent.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' This means the count of true statements should be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.

If true, this supports Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 5: Assess Statements 3 and 4\nBoth Statements 3 and 4 say that exactly 4 statements are true. If either is true, the other is also true, making Statement 5 false, which aligns with our finding in Step 2.\n\n## Step 6: Check the consistency of Statements 3 and 4 with other statements\nIf Statements 3 and 4 are true, then 4 statements are true. This makes Statement 1 true (since at least one is true), Statement 2 true (since at most 3 are false), and Statement 5 false (as deduced). Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is true because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite, but this needs to be checked: 3 is not composite, it's prime, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statements 3 and 4 being true\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: False\n- Statement 6: False (since 4 is not prime)\n- Statement 7: False (since 3 is prime, not composite)\n\nThis gives us 4 true statements and 3 false statements, satisfying Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n## Step 8: Check if the number of true statements satisfies Statement 6\nSince 4 is not a prime number, Statement 6 is false, which is consistent with our count.\n\n## Step 9: Check the number of false statements for Statement 7\nWith 3 false statements, Statement 7 is false because 3 is a prime number, not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze possible combinations based on the statements\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of different numbers of true statements:\n- If 4 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), we've seen it's a possible scenario.\n- We need to check other possible scenarios based on the constraints given by all statements.\n\n## Step 11: Assess the scenario where Statement 2 is true\nIf Statement 2 is true, at least 4 statements are true. We've already explored the case where exactly 4 are true.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate other potential numbers of true statements\nLet's consider the constraints:\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite (4 or 6 for 7 statements).\n\n## Step 13: Check for prime number of true statements (Statement 6)\nFor 7 statements:\n- If 2 are true, 5 are false. Statement 7 is true because 5 is not composite. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true (2 is prime). Statement 7 is false (5 is not composite). So, we have 2 true (1, 6) and 5 false, which doesn't satisfy Statement 1 being one of the true statements if we count correctly: 1 and 6 are true, so Statement 1 is indeed true. But this scenario doesn't fit because Statement 2 is false, and we have to check the count: True statements are 1 and 6, which is 2, a prime number. This is a potential solution.\n\n## Step 14: Verify the solution for 2 true statements\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: False\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: False\n- Statement 5: False\n- Statement 6: True\n- Statement 7: False\nThis configuration is valid because it satisfies Statements 1 and 6.\n\n## Step 15: Check for other prime numbers of true statements\n- For 3 true statements, Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite), and Statement 6 is true. Let's see if it can hold: If 3 are true and 4 are false, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true. So, Statements 1, 6, and 7 can be true. This is a valid configuration.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 1 claims that at least 4 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 claims that at most 5 of the 7 statements are false, which implies that at least 2 statements are true. Statement 3 states that exactly 4 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 4 states that exactly 3 of the 7 statements are false, which means exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements.\nLet's start by examining Statement 3 and Statement 4. Statement 3 says exactly 4 statements are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 4 statements are true (since 7 - 3 = 4). This means both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are saying the same thing, which contradicts Statement 5 that says only one of them can be true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 5 based on Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are essentially saying the same thing (that 4 out of 7 statements are true), they are either both true or both false. Statement 5 states that exactly one of them is true, which means Statement 5 must be false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true individually due to their identical claims.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the implications of Statement 5 being false.\nWith Statement 5 being false, we have 6 statements left to evaluate. Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false together does not directly affect the truth count due to their identical nature. If both are true, it means 4 statements are true. If both are false, it means the number of true statements is not 4.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the possible truth values for the number of true statements based on the remaining statements.\nLet's denote the number of true statements as $T$. Statement 1 implies $T \\geq 4$, Statement 2 implies $T \\geq 2$, Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, Statement 6 implies $T$ is prime, and Statement 7 implies $7 - T$ is composite.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the conditions under which the statements can be true or false.\n- For $T = 4$, Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4 are true. Statement 2 is also true because $T = 4$ satisfies $T \\geq 2$. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because $7 - 4 = 3$ is not composite, it's actually false because 3 is prime, not composite.\n- Let's check the validity of $T = 4$: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. So, we have 4 true statements, which matches Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4.\n\n## Step 7: Check if $T = 4$ satisfies all given conditions.\nFor $T = 4$, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (False), Statement 7 (False). This gives us 4 true statements, which is consistent with Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime, and Statement 7 is false because 3 (the number of false statements) is prime, not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Check other possible values of $T$ based on Statement 6.\nStatement 6 says $T$ is prime. Possible prime values for $T$ are 2, 3, 5, 7. We need to check these against the other statements.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate $T = 2, 3, 5, 7$ against the statements.\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 is false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (2 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (5 is composite). So, we have 3 true statements, which does not match $T = 2$.\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). So, we have 3 true statements, which matches $T = 3$.\n- For $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is prime, not composite). So, we have 4 true statements, which does not match $T = 5$.\n- For $T = 7$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite). So, we have 4 true statements, which does not match $T = 7$.\n\n## Step 10: Verify the solutions.\nLet's verify the cases where $T = 4$ and $T = 3$.\n- For $T = 4$, we've already seen it satisfies the count but let's check the statements: Statement 1 (T), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (T), Statement 4 (T), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (F), Statement 7 (F).

Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 states the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 states the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 both imply that exactly 4 statements are true because Statement 4 says exactly 3 are false, which is equivalent to saying exactly 4 are true. This means both statements cannot be true at the same time, making Statement 5's claim that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both potentially true if either of them is true.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, it also means exactly 4 statements are true. Given Statement 5's condition, if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, the other must be false. However, both being true or both being false would violate Statement 5.

Statement 5 must be false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 2 is true. Statement 7 is true because $7 - 4 = 3$ is not composite, it's actually a mistake since 3 is not composite. Let's correct this: For $T = 4$, Statements 1, 2, 3, 4 are true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. So, $T = 4$ is not valid because it makes Statement 7 false (since 3 is prime, not composite) and Statement 6 false.\n- For $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because $7 - 5 = 2$ is not composite. So, Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true.

This is a valid configuration.\n- For $T = 4$: As analyzed, not valid due to the falsity of Statement 6 and Statement 7.\n- For $T = 5$: Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true. This is a valid configuration.\n- For $T = 7$: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 0 is considered neither prime nor composite).

This means the number of true statements (T) is $T \\geq 4$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that the number of false statements (F) is $F \\leq 5$. Since $T + F = 7$, this translates to $T \\geq 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 states that 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' So, $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 states that 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F = 3$, hence $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, they are equivalent in terms of the number of true statements. Thus, Statement 5 cannot be true because it demands that only one of them is true, but they essentially convey the same information regarding $T$.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the Implications of Statement 5 Being False\nGiven Statement 5 is false, we have $T = 5$ or $T = 2$ (since one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true implies $T = 4$, and Statement 5 being false means either both are true or both are false. Both being true is not possible due to Statement 5's condition, so both being false is the case when $T \\neq 4$).\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 states 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $F$ could be 4 or 6, meaning $T$ could be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Possible Values of T Based on All Statements\nFrom Step 1, $T \\geq 4$. From Step 2, $T \\geq 2$, which is less restrictive. From Step 3 and Step 4 indicate that if either is true, $T = 4$, which satisfies both. Statement 5 being false (as deduced) means we cannot have $T = 4$ as the only possibility; hence, we consider other values. Statement 6 suggests $T$ is prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and Statement 7 suggests $F$ is composite (4 or 6), implying $T = 3$ or $T = 1$. Combining these, $T = 3$ is the only value that satisfies both Statement 6 ($T$ is prime) and Statement 7 ($F = 4$, which is composite).\n\n## Step 10: Check Consistency Across Statements for T = 3\n- Statement 1: $T = 3$ does not satisfy 'At least 4 true.'\n- Statement 2: $F = 4$, so $T = 3$ satisfies 'At most 5 false.'\n- Statement 3: False because $T \\neq 4$.\n- Statement 4: False because $F \\neq 3$.\n- Statement 5: True because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Statement 6: True because $T = 3$ is prime.\n- Statement 7: True because $F = 4$ is composite.\n\n## Step 11: Verify if T = 3 is a Valid Solution\nFor $T = 3$, Statements 2, 5, 6, and 7 are true. This gives us $T = 4$, which contradicts our assumption of $T = 3$. So, $T = 3$ is not a valid solution upon closer inspection because it doesn't satisfy the condition that exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate T = 5 and Other Possible T Values\nLet's directly assess the validity of different $T$ values based on the statements:\n- For $T = 4$, Statements 1, 3, 4 are true. Statement 5 is false. Statement 2 is true because $F = 3 \\leq 5$. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because $F = 3$ is not composite. So, we have 3 true statements, which contradicts $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed Check for T = 4\nLet's re-evaluate the statements for $T = 4$:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7 is false.\nThis gives $T = 4$ ( Statements 1, 2, 3, 4 are true), which is a potential solution.\n\n## Step 14: Checking Other Possible Values\nFor $T = 5$, $F = 2$. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite).

If Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true, which means all other statements, including Statement 4, are false. If Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements are false, which is a contradiction because Statement 4 itself would be false.

Statement 4 is false, which aligns with our finding. Statement 5 is false because it requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both; since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, this condition is actually met, making Statement 5 true, which is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 5: Resolve the contradiction found in Step 4.\nThe contradiction found indicates that our initial assumption about Statement 3 being true might not lead to a valid solution because it makes Statement 5 true, which contradicts the condition that only Statement 3 is true. Let's directly examine the statements for possible truth values.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2.\nStatement 1 (at least 4 true) and Statement 2 (at least 5 true) both being true would mean at least 5 statements are true. If 5 or more statements are true, then Statement 3 (exactly 1 true) is false. Statement 4 (exactly 7 false) is also false because it implies 0 true statements.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the scenario where Statement 2 is true.\nIf Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true. This means Statement 1 is also true. For Statement 2 to be true, we need at least 5 true statements. Let's check the other statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check the consistency of having at least 5 true statements.\nIf at least 5 statements are true, then Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5's truth value depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4; since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, and potentially Statement 6 and Statement 7 being true.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 under the condition of at least 5 true statements.\nFor 5 or 6 true statements, Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) could be true if the number of true statements is 5 (prime) or 7 (prime), but not if it's 6 (not prime). Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) is true if there are 2 or 4 false statements (since 2 is not composite but 4 is, and 0 is not considered composite in many definitions but here it refers to the count of false statements), meaning it could be true for 5 true statements (2 false, not composite) or 3 true statements (4 false, composite), but we're examining the case of at least 5 true.\n\n## Step 10: Check for valid configurations.\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6 true, and Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 7 false. This gives us 3 true statements, not 5, which is a contradiction.\n- If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. So, this scenario is not possible because Statement 6 must be true for 6 true statements to be considered, but it's false.\n- If 7 statements are true, then 0 are false. Statement 7 is false because 0 is not considered composite. So, this scenario is also not possible.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluate the statements for a valid solution.\nLet's directly assess the possible number of true statements and check against all statements.\n\n## Step 12: Checking for the number of true statements that satisfy all given conditions.\nLet's analyze the prime number condition (Statement 6) and the composite condition (Statement 7) together. For a number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6 true), it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7 true), it means the number of true statements should be such that the remaining (7 - true) is composite, so 7 - true = 4 (true = 3), or 6 (true = 1), because 4 and 6 are composite.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Statement 3 claims that exactly 1 of the 7 statements is true. Statement 4 claims that exactly 7 of the 7 statements are false. Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they make contradictory claims about the number of true statements. If Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true, which means all other statements, including Statement 4, are false. If Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements are false, which is a contradiction because Statement 4 itself would be false. Thus, Statement 4 being true is impossible.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 based on Step 2.\nSince Statement 4 cannot be true, for Statement 5 to be true (which states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both), Statement 3 must be true because Statement 4 is false.

Statement 4 (exactly 7 false) is also false because it implies 0 true statements.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the scenario where Statement 2 is true.\nIf Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true.

Let's check the other statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check the consistency of having at least 5 true statements.\nIf at least 5 statements are true, then Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5's truth value depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4; since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, and potentially Statement 6 and Statement 7 being true.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 under the condition of at least 5 true statements.\nFor 5 or 6 true statements, Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) could be true if the number of true statements is 5 (prime) or 7 (prime), but not if it's 6 (not prime). Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) is true if there are 2 or 4 false statements (since 2 is not composite but 4 is, and 0 is not considered composite in many definitions but here it refers to the count of false statements), meaning it could be true for 5 true statements (2 false, not composite) or 3 true statements (4 false, composite), but we're examining the case of at least 5 true.\n\n## Step 10: Check for valid configurations.\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6 true, and Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 7 false. This gives us 3 true statements, not 5, which is a contradiction.\n- If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. So, this scenario is not possible because Statement 6 must be true for 6 true statements to be considered, but it's false.\n- If 7 statements are true, then 0 are false.

If Statement 1 is true, then the number of true statements must be 4 or more.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 5 of the statements are true because if 2 or fewer are false, 5 or more must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it must be the only true statement, meaning all other statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which is a contradiction. Thus, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 4 is false (from Step 4), for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true because Statement 5 requires exactly one of them to be true.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the Truthfulness of Statements Based on Statement 3 and Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all other statements must be false. This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are all false. However, Statement 5 being false implies that either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false. Since Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 being true contradicts Statement 5 being false because it fulfills the condition of Statement 5 (Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false). Thus, we need to examine the consistency of Statement 3 being true and its implications on other statements.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the Implications of Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all other statements are false. This makes Statement 5 false, which is consistent with our analysis that if Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 should be false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true (Statement 4 is false). Let's check the other statements: Statement 1 is false (since only 1 is true), Statement 2 is false (since 6 are false), Statement 4 is false (as deduced), Statement 6 is false (since 1 is not a prime number in this context, it's a special case but often considered not prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 6 is a composite number). This creates a contradiction because we assumed all other statements are false, but Statement 7 is actually true.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate the Statements for Consistency\nGiven the contradiction found in Step 7, let's directly assess the possible number of true statements based on the given statements and check for consistency.\n\n## Step 9: Assess Statement 1 and Statement 2 Together\nBoth Statement 1 and Statement 2 imply a significant number of true statements (at least 4 and at least 5, respectively). If Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 10: Check for Consistency Across All Statements\nLet's directly analyze the statements for possible solutions:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then only it is true, and all others are false. But this leads to a contradiction as seen in Step 7 because Statement 7 would be true.\n- Statement 4 being true is impossible because it claims all statements are false.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze Possible Scenarios Based on the Number of True Statements\nLet's consider the number of true statements (T) and false statements (F), where T + F = 7.\n- Statement 1: T \u2265 4\n- Statement 2: F \u2264 2, so T \u2265 5\n- Statement 3: T = 1\n- Statement 4: F = 7, so T = 0\n- Statement 5: Either T = 1 (Statement 3 true) or F = 7 (Statement 4 true), but not both. Since Statement 4 is false, Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3 being true.\n- Statement 6: T is prime (2, 3, 5, 7)\n- Statement 7: F is composite (4, 6)\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate Statement 2 Being True\nIf Statement 2 is true, then T \u2265 5. This means Statement 1 is also true. For T = 5, Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since F = 2 is not composite). For T = 6 or T = 7, we need to check consistency.\n\n## Step 13: Check Consistency for T = 5\nFor T = 5, the true statements could be Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement X (where X is one of the other statements). However, Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, it contradicts T = 5. If Statement 4 is true, it's also a contradiction because Statement 4 being true means all are false.\n\n## Step 14: Detailed Check for Possible Values of T\nLet's directly check the possible values of T that satisfy multiple conditions:\n- For T = 5, it satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6. Statement 7 is false because F = 2 is not composite.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 2 claims at most 2 of the 7 statements are false, which is equivalent to saying at least 5 statements are true. Statement 3 claims exactly 1 statement is true. Statement 4 claims exactly 7 statements are false, meaning 0 are true. Statement 5 claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they make contradictory claims about the number of true statements. If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 1 statement is true, which means Statement 4 must be false. If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which means Statement 3 must be false. This aligns with Statement 5's claim that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 based on Statement 5.\nStatement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then all other statements are false. This would make Statement 5 false because Statement 4 would be false (as required), but it contradicts the condition that Statement 3 being true makes all other statements false, including Statement 5. So, we need to examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false in detail.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the case when Statement 3 is true.\nIf Statement 3 is true, all other statements must be false. This means Statement 1 is false (less than 4 true), Statement 2 is false (more than 2 false), Statement 4 is false (not all statements are false), Statement 5 is false (because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and Statement 3 is true while Statement 4 is false, so it should be true), Statement 6 is false (0 true statements is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (6 false statements is composite, so this is actually true). This creates a contradiction because Statement 7 would be true, not false.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the case when Statement 4 is true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false. This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are all false. Statement 1 being false means less than 4 statements are true, which is consistent with all being false. Statement 2 being false means more than 2 statements are false, which is true since all 7 are false. Statement 3 being false is consistent because it's not the only true statement. Statement 5 being false is a problem because if Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 should be true (since it claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both). Statement 6 being false is consistent because 0 is not prime. Statement 7 being false means the number of false statements (7) is not composite, but 7 is not composite, it's prime, so Statement 7 is actually false, which is consistent with our assumption. However, the falseness of Statement 5 creates a contradiction.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2 together.\nStatement 1 and Statement 2 both being true implies that at least 5 statements are true because Statement 2 is a stronger condition (at least 5 true statements). If 5 or more statements are true, then Statement 1 is automatically true.\n\n## Step 7: Check for the number of true statements based on Statement 6.\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Possible numbers of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the statements for possible numbers of true statements.\n- If 7 statements are true, Statement 4 is false, creating a contradiction.\n- If 5 statements are true, Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4, and since both are false, Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite, it's prime, so Statement 7 is false. This gives us 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and one other), which doesn't match our assumption of 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed check for 5 true statements.\nFor 5 true statements: Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true. Statement 7 is false because 2 is prime, not composite. This leaves us with Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5 to be considered. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true. If Statement 3 is true, it contradicts our count. If Statement 4 is true, it also contradicts. Statement 5 being true or false depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4. For 5 true statements, having Statement 5 true requires one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true and the other false. But we've established that having either Statement 3 or Statement 4 true leads to contradictions.\n\n## Step 10: Checking the case for 3 true statements.\nIf 3 statements are true, Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 1 is false because not at least 4 statements are true. Statement 2 is false because more than 2 statements are false. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. So, we have at least 3 true statements (Statement 3, Statement 6, Statement 7), which matches our condition. Let's see if this can be satisfied: Statement 3 being true means all others are false, which contradicts our assumption. However, if Statement 6 and Statement 7 are true, and Statement 3 is false, we can have Statement 4, Statement 5 being false. This gives us a possible configuration.\n\n## Step 11: Checking the case for 2 true statements.\nFor 2 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 2 is prime, so this is not a valid configuration under Statement 6 being true. However, we should check the statements. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite. So, we need to find 2 true statements among the 7.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Let's check:\n- Statement 1: False (because not at least 6 true)\n- Statement 2: True (because at most 5 false means at least 2 true, which is possible)\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: False (because Statement 5 is true, making Statement 4 false)\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: False (because 2 is prime, but we need to check if it fits the condition of being one of the true statements)\n- Statement 7: False (because 5 is not composite, it's the number of false statements)\n\n## Step 10: Detailed Check for Statement 3 Being True\nLet's assume Statement 3 and Statement 5 are true. Then:\n- Statement 1 is False.\n- Statement 2 is True (since 5 statements are false, which is at most 5).\n- Statement 3 is True.\n- Statement 4 is False.\n- Statement 5 is True.\n- Statement 6 is False (2 true statements, and 2 is prime).\n- Statement 7 is False (5 false statements, and 5 is not composite).\n\nThis gives us 3 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5), which contradicts our initial assumption of exactly 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the Scenarios Based on Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true. Let's examine:\n- Statement 1: False (because exactly 5 true statements, not at least 6)\n- Statement 2: True (because 2 statements are false, which is at most 5)\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: True (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true)\n- Statement 6: True (because 5 is prime)\n- Statement 7: True (because 2 is not composite, but it's the number of false statements; however, 2 is not considered composite in many definitions but is not prime either, yet for our purposes, we note it's not composite)\n\n## Step 12: Detailed Check for Statement 4 Being True\nLet's verify if 5 statements can be true:\n- Statement 1: False\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: True\n- Statement 7: False (because 2 is not composite)\n\nThis results in 4 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6), not 5, which contradicts our assumption.\n\n## Step 13: Checking for Other Possible Combinations\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of the statements being true or false based on their conditions and the conditions given by other statements.\n\n## Step 14: Final Evaluation\nUpon closer inspection, we need to directly check the conditions and see which ones can be satisfied together.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This is equivalent to saying 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' because if you have 7 statements and at most 5 are false, then at least 2 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true,' which implies 5 are false. Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false,' which implies 5 are true. These two statements cannot be true at the same time.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are mutually exclusive, Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. If both are false, Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 together with Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false, and again Statement 5 is true. If both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then Statement 5 is false. So, Statement 5 being true requires exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true.\n\n## Step 6: Check the implications of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false (because it claims 5 are true), and Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true. So, we have at least 2 true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 5). Statement 1 cannot be true because it requires at least 6 true statements. Statement 2 is true because at least 2 statements are true. Statement 6 is false because 2 is a prime number, but we're checking the scenario where Statement 3 is true, so it actually supports Statement 6 being true since 2 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 5 (the number of false statements) is not composite in the context of being a count of false statements; it's actually true that 5 is not composite. However, we need to verify the count: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite. So, we have 4 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption that Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Check the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false, meaning 5 are true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as potentially true. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because at least 6 statements are true (we have 5 true). Statement 2 is true because at most 5 are false (we have 2 false). Statement 4 is true. Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is true if 5 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. So, the true statements are Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and one more needs to be false for Statement 4 to hold, but we actually have 5 true and 2 false, which fits Statement 4. However, Statement 1 is also true, making 6 true statements, not 5. This contradicts our count.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate Statement 1 and its implications\nIf Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements are true. This means either 6 or 7 statements are true. If 7 are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both false, which makes Statement 5 false, resulting in 6 true statements at most, which is a contradiction. So, if Statement 1 is true, exactly 6 statements must be true.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the scenario where exactly 6 statements are true\nIf exactly 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. Statement 1 being true implies 6 or 7 are true, so if it's one of the true statements, it creates a contradiction unless it's false. So, Statement 1 must be the false one. The true statements would then be Statement 2, Statement 4 (or Statement 3, but not both), Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7, or any other combination that gives 6 true statements. Let's check: If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is not prime, but we're considering 6 true statements, and 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 1 is composite. This gives a valid scenario.\n\n## Step 10: Verify the possible combinations for 6 true statements\nLet's verify if having 6 true statements is possible with the given statements. For 6 true statements, Statement 1 must be false. A possible combination could be: Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (true), Statement 5 (true), Statement 6 (false because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 (true). This gives us 5 true statements. Let's adjust: If Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6 is false (because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 are true, and Statement 1 and Statement 3 are false, we have a valid count. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is false, Statement 7 is true. This gives us 4 true statements, not 6.\n\n## Step 11: Check for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6)\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. We've already analyzed scenarios around these numbers.\n\n## Step 12: Summarize findings\nFrom the steps above, we need to directly check the validity of each statement against the possible numbers of true statements and see which scenarios satisfy all given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

We have 7 statements, and we need to determine the number of possible solutions based on their truthfulness.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1.\nStatement 1 says, 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements must be true. This means 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2.\nStatement 2 says, 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 2 statements are true because if 5 or fewer statements are false, then 2 or more must be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 says, 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4 says, 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true, and 5 are false. If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false, and 5 are true. These statements cannot both be true because they imply different numbers of true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5.\nStatement 5 says, 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but not both. This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the implications of Statement 3 being true.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false (because of Statement 5), and there are exactly 2 true statements. The true statements could be Statement 3 and Statement 5. Other statements must be false. Let's check: Statement 1 is false (because not at least 6 are true), Statement 2 is true (because at most 5 are false, and 5 are indeed false), which creates a contradiction because Statement 2 being true would mean there are at least 2 true statements, and we already have Statement 3 and Statement 5 as true. So, Statement 2 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true. Thus, having Statement 3 as true leads to a contradiction when trying to satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 4 being true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false. This means exactly 2 statements are false, and 5 are true. Statement 1 being true satisfies the condition of at least 6 statements being true being false, so it's false. Statement 2 being true means at most 5 statements are false, which is true because 2 are false. Statement 4 being true and Statement 3 being false satisfies Statement 5. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number; 5 is prime, so Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite; 2 is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 8: Check the validity of having Statement 4 true.\nLet's list the statements: Statement 1 (false), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (true), Statement 5 (true), Statement 6 (true), Statement 7 (false). So, we have 5 true statements (Statements 2, 4, 5, 6) and 2 false statements (Statements 1, 3, 7). This configuration satisfies the conditions: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime, and Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the number of true and false statements for consistency across all statements.\nFor Statement 4 being true: We have 5 true statements and 2 false statements. This makes Statement 1 false, Statement 2 true, Statement 3 false, Statement 4 true, Statement 5 true, Statement 6 true, and Statement 7 false. This is a valid configuration.\n\n## Step 10: Check if there are other possible configurations.\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of other configurations based on the statements. Given the constraints, we've identified one valid configuration. Let's verify if Statement 1 and Statement 2 can both be true or both be false and the implications.\n\n## Step 11: Assess the prime and composite conditions.\nStatement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) and Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) provide additional constraints. For 7 statements, the possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, 7. The possible composite numbers of false statements are 4, 6.\n\n## Step 12: Summarize findings.\nWe've found one valid configuration where Statement 4 is true, and it satisfies the given conditions. Let's verify if there are other configurations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which means 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This is because if you have 7 statements and at most 3 are false, then 7 - 3 = 4 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true,' and Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false,' which is equivalent to saying 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the implications of Statement 5\nGiven Statement 5, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. If Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 4 being false means there are not exactly 6 true statements, which aligns with Statement 3 being true. If Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), then Statement 3 being false means there are not exactly 5 true statements, which again aligns because there are 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the truth values based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true, then there are 5 true statements. This implies Statement 4 is false. So, we have at least Statement 3 and Statement 5 as true (because Statement 5 is true if Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false), and Statement 4 as false. If Statement 4 is true, then there are 6 true statements, making Statement 3 false. This again satisfies Statement 5.\n\n## Step 6: Check the validity of Statement 1 and Statement 2 under different scenarios\nFor Statement 3 being true (5 true statements), Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true. For Statement 4 being true (6 true statements), Statement 1 is also true. Statement 2 is true if there are 4 or more true statements, so it's true in both cases (5 or 6 true statements).\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the scenarios when Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, we have 5 true statements. So, Statements 1, 2, 3, 5 are true. Statement 4 is false. We need to check Statements 6 and 7. With 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number. With 2 false statements, Statement 7 is false because 2 is not a composite number (it's prime). So, we have 5 true statements (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and 2 false statements (4, 7), which satisfies Statement 3.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the scenarios when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, we have 6 true statements. So, Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 are true (because 6 is not prime, Statement 6 is actually false, which creates a contradiction). Let's correct this: If Statement 4 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 4, 5 are true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 1 is not composite, it's considered neither prime nor composite, but here it refers to the number of false statements being 1, which is not composite. So, we actually have 5 true statements (1, 2, 4, 5, 7) and 2 false statements (3, 6), which does not satisfy Statement 4.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate the scenario for Statement 4 being true with correct analysis\nLet's directly check the validity: If Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true. This means Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 are true, and Statement 3 is false. However, Statement 6 being true with 6 true statements is incorrect because 6 is not a prime number. So, the correct count is: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 are true, and Statements 3, 6 are false. This gives us 5 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption that Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 10: Check for other possible distributions of true and false statements\nLet's directly analyze the statements for other possible numbers of true statements and see if they satisfy all given conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Summarize findings\nFrom Step 7, we have a valid solution where Statement 3 is true, and we have 5 true statements.

Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' We need to understand that the number of true statements and the number of false statements must add up to 7.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the statements into mathematical expressions\nLet's denote the number of true statements as $T$ and the number of false statements as $F$. Thus, $T + F = 7$. Statement 1: $T \\geq 3$. Statement 2: $F \\leq 3$, which implies $T \\geq 4$ because $T = 7 - F$. Statement 3: $T = 5$. Statement 4: $F = 1$, which implies $T = 6$. Statement 5: This statement implies that either $T = 5$ or $T = 6$ but not both. Statement 6: $T$ is a prime number. Statement 7: $F$ is a composite number.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 ($T = 5$) or Statement 4 ($T = 6$) is true, but not both. If $T = 5$, then Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false. If $T = 6$, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false. We need to check the validity of these scenarios considering all other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the scenarios based on Statement 3 being true ($T = 5$) and Statement 4 being false ($T = 6$)\nIf $T = 5$, then Statement 3 is true. This means Statement 4 is false. So, $F = 2$ (since $T = 5$ and $T + F = 7$). Let's check other statements: Statement 1 is true because $T = 5 \\geq 3$. Statement 2 is true because $F = 2 \\leq 3$. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true if $T = 5$ is prime, which it is not because 5 is prime, so this is actually true. Statement 7 is false because $F = 2$ is not composite (it's prime). So, we have $T = 5$ and the truth values of the statements are: S1 = True, S2 = True, S3 = True, S4 = False, S5 = True, S6 = True, S7 = False. This gives us $T = 5$, which matches the condition.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the scenario based on Statement 4 being true ($T = 6$) and Statement 3 being false ($T = 5$)\nIf $T = 6$, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false. So, $F = 1$. Let's check: Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because $F = 1 \\leq 3$. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 is false because $T = 6$ is not prime. Statement 7 is false because $F = 1$ is not composite. So, the truth values are: S1 = True, S2 = True, S3 = False, S4 = True, S5 = True, S6 = False, S7 = False. This gives $T = 4$, which does not match $T = 6$. Thus, this scenario is not valid.\n\n## Step 6: Check for other possible values of $T$ that satisfy all given conditions without assuming Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true\nWe need to check if there are other $T$ values that could satisfy the given statements. For $T = 4$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both S3 and S4 are false), Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (because $F = 3$ is not composite). So, S1 = True, S2 = True, S3 = False, S4 = False, S5 = True, S6 = False, S7 = False, giving $T = 3$, which does not match. For $T = 7$, all statements would need to be true, but this leads to a contradiction because Statement 7 would be false ($F = 0$ is not composite). For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true (since $F = 4$), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since $F = 4$ is composite). So, S1 = True, S2 = True, S3 = False, S4 = False, S5 = True, S6 = True, S7 = True, resulting in $T = 5$, which is not consistent.\n\n## Step 7: Verify the consistency of $T = 5$ with all statements\nFor $T = 5$, we have: S1 = True, S2 = True, S3 = True, S4 = False, S5 = True, S6 = True, S7 = False. Let's verify: Statement 1 ($T \\geq 3$) is True. Statement 2 ($F \\leq 3$) is True. Statement 3 ($T = 5$) is True. Statement 4 ($T = 6$) is False. Statement 5 (Either S3 or S4 is true, but not both) is True. Statement 6 ($T$ is prime) is True because 5 is prime. Statement 7 ($F$ is composite) is False because 2 is not composite. This configuration is consistent with $T = 5$.\n\n## Step 8: Count the number of valid solutions\nWe found one valid solution where $T = 5$. Let's check if there are other configurations that satisfy all statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's understand and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which is equivalent to saying 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This is because if you have 7 statements and at most 3 are false, then at least 4 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true,' and Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false,' which is equivalent to saying 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This implies that we cannot have both 5 true statements and 6 true statements simultaneously.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the implications of Statement 5\nGiven Statement 5, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. Let's examine the truth values based on Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the case when Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false. So, we have Statement 3 true, Statement 4 false, and 4 other statements to evaluate. Statement 1 would be true because at least 3 statements are true. Statement 2 would be true because at least 4 statements are true (since 5 are true). Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 needs to be evaluated based on the number of true statements. With 5 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 5 is a prime number, making it true, but we need to check the consistency. Statement 7 would be false because 2 false statements are not composite (a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself). So, we have: Statement 1 (T), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (T), Statement 4 (F), Statement 5 (T), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (F). This gives us 5 true statements, which is consistent with Statement 3 being true.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the case when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true. This implies Statement 3 is false. So, we have Statement 4 true, Statement 3 false. Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at least 4 statements are true. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, but this needs careful consideration since 6 is indeed not prime. Statement 7 is false because 1 false statement is not composite. So, we check: Statement 1 (T), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (F), Statement 4 (T), Statement 5 (T), Statement 6 (F), Statement 7 (F). This results in 5 true statements, not 6, which contradicts Statement 4.\n\n## Step 7: Check the consistency of Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 with the possible number of true statements\nLet's directly analyze the possible number of true statements based on the statements given and check for consistency.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the number of true statements based on Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, if the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7, the number of false statements would be 5, 4, 2, or 0, respectively. The number of false statements is composite for 4 (when true statements are 3) and not for 5, 2, or 0.\n\n## Step 9: Check for the number of true statements that satisfy all conditions\nLet's directly check the possible scenarios:\n- If 3 statements are true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite). Statement 2 is true. This gives a potential solution.\n\n## Step 10: Verify the solution for 3 true statements\nFor 3 true statements: Statement 1 (T), Statement 2 (T), Statement 6 (T), and the rest are false. Statement 3 (F), Statement 4 (F), Statement 5 (F), Statement 7 (T). This configuration has 4 true statements, not 3, which is inconsistent.\n\n## Step 11: Check other possible numbers of true statements\nLet's examine other possibilities based on Statement 6 (prime number of true statements): For 2 true statements, Statement 1 is false. For 5 true statements, we've already seen it's a potential solution. For 7 true statements, all statements must be true, which leads to a contradiction because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n\n## Step 12: Re-evaluate Statement 3 being true as a potential solution\nWe've already found that when Statement 3 is true, we have a consistent solution with 5 true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This is equivalent to saying 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' because if you have 7 statements and at most 3 are false, then at least 4 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims all 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false because it claims exactly 2 statements are false, which contradicts Statement 3. Statement 4 being false means there are not exactly 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 5\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false. This statement can be true or false depending on the truth values of Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true. This means Statement 4 is also true, which contradicts Statement 5 because Statement 5 requires that only one of them is true. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the implications of Statement 3 being false\nSince Statement 3 is false, not all 7 statements are true. This means there is at least 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 4 given Statement 3 is false\nWith Statement 3 being false, Statement 5 dictates that Statement 4 must be true because Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, exactly 2 statements are false.\n\n## Step 8: Identify the false statements based on Statement 4 being true\nSince Statement 4 is true, and it states that exactly 2 statements are false, we know Statement 3 is one of the false statements because we've established it's false. The other false statement needs to be identified.\n\n## Step 9: Check the consistency of the statements with exactly 2 being false\nStatement 1: At least 3 true, so with 5 true, it's true. Statement 2: At most 3 false, so with 2 false, it's true. Statement 3: False, as established. Statement 4: True. Statement 5: True because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6: The number of true statements (5) is prime, so it's true. Statement 7: The number of false statements (2) is not composite (it's prime), so it's false.\n\n## Step 10: Verify if the identified false statements satisfy all conditions\nWe have Statement 3 and Statement 7 as the false statements. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because 5 out of 7 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because 2 out of 7 statements are false, which is less than or equal to 3. Statement 4 is true as exactly 2 statements are false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n\n## Step 11: Check for other possible combinations\nLet's directly assess the validity of having exactly 2 false statements as per Statement 4. We've identified one possible solution where Statement 3 and Statement 7 are false.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the number of possible solutions based on the analysis\nGiven that Statement 4 is true and exactly 2 statements are false, and we've identified Statement 3 and Statement 7 as these false statements, we need to check if this is the only possible configuration.\n\n## Step 13: Assess alternative configurations\nIf Statement 4 is false, then Statement 3 must be true (because of Statement 5), but we've established Statement 3 cannot be true. So, our initial configuration where Statement 4 is true is a valid starting point.\n\n## Step 14: Final check on the prime and composite conditions\nStatement 6 is true if the number of true statements is prime. With 5 true statements, it's true. Statement 7 is false if the number of false statements is not composite.

Thus, $T = 7$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 4 and its implications\nStatement 4 implies $T = 5$ and $F = 2$. Let's check the statements.\n- Statement 1 is true because $5 \\geq 3$.\n- Statement 2 is true because $2 \\leq 3$.\n- Statement 3 is false because $T \\neq 7$.\n- Statement 4 is true by assumption.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, so it doesn't satisfy \"but not both\" since Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 is not a composite number.\n\n## Step 5: Check if $T = 5$ is a valid solution\nFor $T = 5$, Statements 1, 2, 4, and 6 are true, and Statements 3, 5, and 7 are false.

So, $T = 5$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the constraints from Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7\nFrom Statement 2, we have $T \\geq 4$. Statement 1 is satisfied if $T \\geq 3$, which is automatically true if $T \\geq 4$. Statement 6 requires $T$ to be prime, so $T$ could be 5 or 7. We've already examined $T = 7$ and $T = 5$.

Both of these values contradict Statement 2.\n\n## Step 7: Check for $T = 4$\nLet's see if $T = 4$ is possible.\n- Statement 1 is true because $4 \\geq 3$.\n- Statement 2 is true because $3 \\leq 3$.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 could be true or false depending on Statements 3 and 4.

If $T = 7$, then all statements are true. However, Statement 4 would be false because it says $T = 5$, but since all statements are true according to Statement 3, Statement 4 cannot be true, which aligns with Statement 5 being true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Let's check other statements: Statement 1 is true because $T = 7 \\geq 3$; Statement 2 is true because $F = 0 \\leq 3$; Statement 6 is true because $T = 7$ is prime; Statement 7 is false because $F = 0$ is not composite. So, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 7 is false, which contradicts $T = 7$. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 4\nGiven Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 implies that Statement 4 must be true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.

The false statements are 3 and 7. This satisfies Statement 4 ($T = 5$) and Statement 5 (since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true). Let's check:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n\n## Step 6: Check other possible values of $T$ based on the constraints\nFrom Statement 2, $T \\geq 4$. From Statement 6, $T$ must be 2, 3, 5, or 7. Combining these, $T$ could be 5 or 7, but we've established $T = 7$ is not possible.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate if there are other valid $T$ values\nWe've already established that $T = 5$ is a valid solution. Let's check if $T = 3$ or $T = 2$ could be valid given the constraints.\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true if $F = 4$, which is the case when $T = 3$. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 4$ is composite. So, Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7 are true, making $T = 4$, which contradicts $T = 3$. Thus, $T = 3$ is not valid.\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false because $T < 3$. This immediately makes $T = 2$ not a valid solution since one of the true statements (Statement 1) is false.\n\n## Step 8: Conclusion on the number of possible solutions\nWe have found that $T = 5$ is a valid solution.

This implies that the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 4.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 5, or equivalently, T is greater than or equal to 2.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies T = 0.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies F = 3, or T = 4.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This statement can be true if either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' This implies T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7 since T cannot be greater than 7).\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' This implies F is a composite number (4, 6 since F cannot be greater than 7 and 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 are not composite).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then all statements must be false. However, this creates a contradiction because if all statements are false, then Statement 3 being true would mean it's actually false. Thus, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 3 being false on Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 4 must be true because Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 4 being true means T = 4 (since F = 3).\n\n## Step 4: Check if T = 4 satisfies the other statements\nIf T = 4, then:\n- Statement 1 is true because T = 4 satisfies 'at least 4 are true.'\n- Statement 2 is true because F = 3 satisfies 'at most 5 are false.'\n- Statement 4 is true as per our assumption.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6: T = 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7: F = 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 5: Verify if T = 4 is a valid solution\nWith T = 4, we have Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 as true, and Statements 3, 6, and 7 as false. This satisfies Statement 1 (T >= 4), Statement 2 (F <= 5), and Statement 4 (F = 3). Thus, T = 4 is a valid solution.\n\n## Step 6: Check for other possible values of T that satisfy all given conditions\nLet's examine other possible values for T based on the constraints:\n- For T = 0 (Statement 3), it's not valid as shown in Step 2.\n- For T = 2 (minimum from Statement 2), it's not prime, so Statement 6 is false. F = 5, which is not composite, making Statement 7 false. We need to check if there's a configuration that satisfies all other statements.\n- For T = 3, Statement 1 is false. F = 4, which is composite, so Statement 7 is true. Statement 6 is false because 3 is prime, so it's actually true, creating a contradiction because Statement 1 is false.\n- For T = 5, Statement 1 is true. F = 2, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. We need to check the validity of other statements.\n- For T = 7, Statement 1 is true. F = 0, which is not considered composite in many definitions but is sometimes considered so in certain contexts; however, it's generally not composite. Statement 6 is true because 7 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 0 is not composite.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze T = 5 and T = 7 further\nFor T = 5:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false because F = 2.\n- Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3 being false (which is true) and Statement 4 being false (which is true), so Statement 5 is false because both are not true.\n- Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is false because F = 2 is not composite.\n\nFor T = 7:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 8: Check the validity of T = 5 and T = 7\nFor T = 5, we have Statements 1, 2, 6 as true, and Statements 3, 4, 5, 7 as false. This gives T = 3 true statements, which contradicts our assumption of T = 5. Thus, T = 5 is not valid upon detailed examination because it doesn't satisfy the condition that exactly 5 statements are true.\n\nFor T = 7, Statements 1, 2, 6 are true. Statements 3, 4, 5, 7 are false. This configuration is valid because it satisfies the truthfulness of Statements 1, 2, and 6.\n\n## Step 9: Summarize valid solutions\nWe found that T = 4 is a valid solution. Let's directly check the validity of other potential T values based on prime numbers (T = 2, 3, 5, 7) and see if they can satisfy all conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

However, if all statements are false, then Statement 3 being true contradicts this condition because it asserts that all statements are false, including itself. Thus, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the Implications of Statement 3 Being False\nSince Statement 3 is false, Statement 5's claim that 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both' implies that Statement 4 must be true because Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false,' meaning 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Assess Statement 1 with the Knowledge that 4 Statements are True\nStatement 1 says 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Given that we've established 4 statements are true (from Statement 4 being true), Statement 1 is also true because 4 is at least 4.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 2\nStatement 2 states 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' Since we've determined that 3 statements are false (from Statement 4), Statement 2 is true because 3 is at most 5.\n\n## Step 5: Verify the Truthfulness of Statements Based on the Number of True and False Statements\nWe have Statement 4 as true, implying 4 true statements and 3 false statements. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true based on this distribution. So, we have at least 3 true statements (Statements 1, 2, and 4).\n\n## Step 6: Check Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' With 4 true statements, this statement is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 7: Check Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Since there are 3 false statements, and 3 is not a composite number (it's a prime number), Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 8: Compile the Truth Values of All Statements\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: True (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, satisfying the condition of either being true but not both)\n- Statement 6: False\n- Statement 7: False\n\n## Step 9: Validate the Consistency of the Truth Values\nWe have 4 true statements (1, 2, 4, 5) and 3 false statements (3, 6, 7), which is consistent with Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 10: Check if the Solution Satisfies All True Statements\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because at least 4 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because at most 5 statements are false.\n- Statement 4 is satisfied because exactly 3 statements are false.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 11: Consider Alternative Scenarios\nLet's directly check the validity of other possible distributions based on the statements given.\n\n## Step 12: Assess the Possibility of Other Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the fact that we've derived a consistent solution where Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are true, and Statements 3, 6, and 7 are false, we need to consider if other configurations could satisfy all given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

If Statement 3 is true, then all statements must be false, which is a contradiction because Statement 3 itself would be true. Thus, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the implications of Statement 3 being false on Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 4 must be true because Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.

However, Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, so $T = 7$ is not valid due to Statement 5 being false.\n- Other $T$ values need to be checked against all statements.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 for possible $T$\nStatement 6 implies $T$ is prime. Possible $T$ values are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n- For $T = 2$, $F = 5$. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true (since 5 is not composite). Here, Statements 2, 5, 6, and 7 are true, so $T = 4$, which doesn't match.\n- For $T = 3$, $F = 4$. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true. So, Statements 2, 4, 6, and 7 are true, making $T = 4$, which again doesn't match.\n- For $T = 5$, $F = 2$. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. So, Statements 1, 2, 5, and 6 are true, making $T = 4$, which doesn't match.\n- For $T = 7$, we've already analyzed it.\n\n## Step 8: Detailed check for $T = 2, 3, 5$\n- For $T = 2$: Statements 2, 6, 7 are true if $T = 2$ because 2 is prime and 5 is not composite. But Statement 1 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true.

This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total. If all statements are true, then Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 6 out of 7 statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for the possibility of 0 or 1 false statements among the 7.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it must be one of the 2 true statements, implying that the other true statement could be any one of the remaining 6 statements.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 3 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, it counts as one of the true statements.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 5 being true\nIf Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Let's examine both cases:\n- If Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, then exactly 2 statements are true. Statement 3 being true satisfies this condition, and we need to check if there's another true statement. Statement 5 is true, so one of the true statements is Statement 5, and the other could be Statement 3, making Statement 3 and Statement 5 the two true statements. Other statements must be false.\n- If Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, then exactly 4 statements are false, meaning 3 are true. Statement 4 being true is one of the true statements. We need to find 2 more true statements among the remaining.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 1 and Statement 2\nIf Statement 1 is true, all statements must be true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false. Thus, Statement 1 cannot be true if we are to satisfy other conditions. Statement 2 being true implies that at most 1 statement is false, which is consistent with Statement 1 being false and all others being true, but this directly contradicts Statement 1.\n\n## Step 9: Check for consistency across statements\nLet's directly check the statements for possible truth values:\n- If Statement 1 is true, all statements are true, which is impossible because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n- Statement 2 being true means at most 1 statement is false. If Statement 2 is true and Statement 1 is false, it satisfies the condition of at most 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed analysis of possible scenarios based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nLet's analyze the scenarios based on Statement 3 and Statement 4:\n1. If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. Statement 5 must be true, and Statement 4 must be false. So, we have at least 2 true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 5). We need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 11: Checking consistency for Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, and Statement 5 is true, then Statement 4 is false. Statement 1 and Statement 2 cannot both be true because Statement 1 requires all statements to be true. Let's examine the truthfulness of other statements:\n- Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. If exactly 2 statements are true (as per Statement 3), 2 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true. This gives us 3 true statements (Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6), which contradicts Statement 3.\n\n## Step 12: Checking the scenario where Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are false, and 3 are true. Statement 3 must be false. Statement 5 being true means Statement 3 is false, which is consistent. So, we have Statement 4 and Statement 5 as true. We need one more true statement.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluating the truthfulness of statements when Statement 4 is true\nWith Statement 4 being true (and thus 3 true statements and 4 false statements), Statement 5 is true, and we need one more true statement. Statement 1 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 3 is false as per Statement 5. Let's check Statement 6 and Statement 7:\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements is 3, which is prime. So, Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements is 4, which is composite. So, Statement 7 is true.\n\n## Step 14: Checking the consistency of statements when Statement 4 is true\nWe have Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as true (3 true statements), and Statement 7 is also true, making 4 true statements. This contradicts our initial assumption based on Statement 4 being true. However, it actually satisfies the condition of having 4 true statements, not 3.\n\n## Step 15: Final evaluation\nLet's directly assess the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and check for consistency.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Let's examine both cases:\n- If Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, then exactly 2 statements are true. Statement 3 being true satisfies this condition, and we need to check if there's another true statement. Statement 5 is true, so one of the true statements is Statement 5, and the other could be Statement 3, making Statement 3 and Statement 5 the two true statements. Other statements must be false.\n- If Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, then exactly 4 statements are false, meaning 3 are true. Statement 4 being true is one of the true statements. We need to find 2 more true statements among the remaining.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 1 and Statement 2\nIf Statement 1 is true, all statements must be true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false. Thus, Statement 1 cannot be true if we are to satisfy other conditions. Statement 2 being true implies that at most 1 statement is false, which is consistent with Statement 1 being false and all others being true, but this directly contradicts Statement 1.\n\n## Step 9: Check for consistency across statements\nLet's directly check the statements for possible truth values:\n- If Statement 1 is true, all statements are true, which is impossible because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n- Statement 2 being true means at most 1 statement is false. If Statement 2 is true and Statement 1 is false, it satisfies the condition of at most 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed analysis of possible scenarios based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nLet's analyze the scenarios based on Statement 3 and Statement 4:\n1. If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. Statement 5 must be true, and Statement 4 must be false. So, we have at least 2 true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 5). We need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 11: Checking consistency for Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, and Statement 5 is true, then Statement 4 is false. Statement 1 and Statement 2 cannot both be true because Statement 1 requires all statements to be true. Let's examine the truthfulness of other statements:\n- Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. If exactly 2 statements are true (as per Statement 3), 2 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true. This gives us 3 true statements (Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6), which contradicts Statement 3.\n\n## Step 12: Checking the scenario where Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are false, and 3 are true. Statement 3 must be false. Statement 5 being true means Statement 3 is false, which is consistent. So, we have Statement 4 and Statement 5 as true. We need one more true statement.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluating the truthfulness of statements when Statement 4 is true\nWith Statement 4 being true (and thus 3 true statements and 4 false statements), Statement 5 is true, and we need one more true statement. Statement 1 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 3 is false as per Statement 5. Let's check Statement 6 and Statement 7:\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements is 3, which is prime. So, Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements is 4, which is composite. So, Statement 7 is true.\n\n## Step 14: Checking the consistency of statements when Statement 4 is true\nWe have Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as true (3 true statements), and Statement 7 is also true, making 4 true statements. This contradicts our initial assumption based on Statement 4 being true. However, it actually satisfies the condition of having 4 true statements, not 3.\n\n## Step 15: Final evaluation\nLet's directly assess the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and check for consistency.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true, and it satisfies its own condition. However, we need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 6 out of 7 statements must be true. For Statement 2 to be true, there can be either 0 or 1 false statement among the 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it must be one of the 2 true statements, and the other true statement could be any one of the remaining 6. This implies that 5 statements must be false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 3 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, it counts as one of the true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the Possibility of Statement 3 and Statement 4 Being True or False\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 4 being true because if Statement 4 is true, it implies 3 statements are true.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. This makes Statement 3 false because it claims exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate Statement 5 with Statement 3 and Statement 4\nFor Statement 5 to be true, given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, we have two scenarios:\n1. Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false. This means exactly 2 statements are true.\n2. Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is true. This means exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 8: Check Consistency Across Statements\nLet's analyze the truthfulness based on the conditions given:\n- If Statement 1 is true, all statements must be true, which contradicts Statements 3 and 4 directly because they cannot both be true and satisfy their conditions simultaneously with Statement 1.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the Number of True Statements Based on Given Conditions\nLet's directly assess the statements:\n- Statement 1 being true implies all statements are true, which is not possible due to the contradictions with other statements.\n- Statement 2 being true means at most 1 statement is false. If Statement 2 is true, then at least 6 statements are true, which again leads to a contradiction because not all statements can be true given their conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Assess the Truthfulness of Statements Together\nLet's consider the scenarios based on Statement 5:\n1. If Statement 3 is true (and Statement 4 is false), then exactly 2 statements are true. The true statements could be Statement 3 and Statement 5. Other statements being false satisfies Statement 3. Let's check: Statement 1 is false (because not all are true), Statement 2 is false (because more than 1 is false), Statement 4 is false (as per our assumption), Statement 6 could be false if the number of true statements is not prime (2 is prime, so it's true), and Statement 7 could be true or false depending on the number of false statements (5 is not composite, it's false). So, we have Statement 3, Statement 5, and potentially Statement 6 as true, which gives us 3 true statements, contradicting Statement 3.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed Check for Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements are true, and 4 are false. Statement 3 must be false. Let's see if this can satisfy all conditions: Statement 1 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 2 is false because more than 1 statement is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, satisfying the \"but not both\" condition. Statement 6 needs to be checked: if 3 statements are true, then the number of true statements (3) is prime, so Statement 6 is true. Statement 7: if 4 statements are false, then the number of false statements is composite (4 is composite), so Statement 7 is true. So, we have Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as potentially true. This gives us 4 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption that exactly 3 statements are true based on Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 12: Final Evaluation\nLet's directly check the number of true statements that satisfy all given conditions without assuming the truth of any particular statement first.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

We need to analyze each statement and determine the possible number of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total. If all 7 are true, then Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that either all 7 statements are true or 6 are true and 1 is false. If all 7 are true, it satisfies Statement 1. If 6 are true and 1 is false, then Statement 2 is still true because it allows for at most 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then 5 statements must be false. We need to check if this condition can be satisfied.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 3 statements are true. We will check the consistency of this statement with others.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. We need to examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime means it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite could be 4 or 6, because these are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 9: Check the consistency of the statements\nLet's start by checking the extreme cases:\n- If all statements are true (7 true), then Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 0 is not composite). So, we have 3 true statements (1, 2, 6) and 4 false statements, which contradicts the assumption that all 7 are true.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the statements for possible truth values\nLet's examine the case where Statement 1 is true. If Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements must be true, which we've found to be inconsistent.\n\n## Step 11: Check for the number of true statements based on Statement 6\nStatement 6 indicates the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. We've already seen that 7 true statements lead to inconsistency.\n\n## Step 12: Examine the case for 2 true statements (Statement 3)\nIf exactly 2 statements are true (as per Statement 3), then Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 must be false. Statement 3 being true means 5 statements are false. Let's check: Statement 1 is false (ok), Statement 2 is false (ok because more than 1 is false), Statement 4 is false (which means not exactly 4 are false, so 5 being false is ok), Statement 5 is false (which is ok because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are not both true or both false, but here Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is false (since 2 is prime, this is actually true, so this creates a problem), and Statement 7 is false (since 5 is not composite, this is true). So, Statement 3 being true creates a contradiction because Statement 6 would be true.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the case for 3 true statements (Statement 4 implies 3 true)\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements are true and 4 are false. Statement 5 being true would mean Statement 3 is false. Let's consider the implications: If Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false, then Statement 5 is true. So, we have at least 3 true statements (4, 5, and potentially others). For 3 true statements, possible combinations need to be checked against all statements.\n\n## Step 14: Detailed check for 3 true statements\nLet's assume Statement 4 is true (3 true, 4 false). Then, Statement 3 is false. For Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be false and Statement 4 true, which fits. Statement 1 is false (because not all 7 are true), Statement 2 is false (because more than 1 is false), Statement 6 could be true if 3 is prime (which it is), and Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. So, Statements 4, 5, 6, and 7 could potentially be true, which gives us 4 true statements, contradicting our assumption of exactly 3 true statements.\n\n## Step 15: Checking for other possible numbers of true statements\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Let's see if this can satisfy the conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

If true, then 5, 6, or 7 statements must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' If true, then exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' We need to check the truthfulness of Statements 3 and 4 to verify this.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 since 0 is not considered composite.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the possible number of true statements based on the given statements\nLet's examine the possibilities:\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there are at most 1 false statements, meaning 6 or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 3 being true means exactly 3 true statements.\n- Statement 4 being true means exactly 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Check the consistency of the statements\nLet's check the statements for consistency:\n- If Statement 3 is true (3 true statements), Statement 1 cannot be true because it requires at least 5 true statements. Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 1 statement is false (6 true statements). Statement 5 can be true if Statement 4 is false, which is the case here. So, we have a potential scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 5 can be true.\n- Statement 4 being true (6 true statements) implies Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. So, we have 6 true statements: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (since 1 false statement is not composite, Statement 7 is false, but this contradicts our assumption). Let's verify: if 6 statements are true, then Statement 6 is true because 6 is not prime, it's a problem. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite.\n\n## Step 11: Examine the truthfulness of Statement 6 and Statement 7 for different numbers of true statements\nFor 7 statements:\n- If all 7 are true, Statement 1, 2, 6, and 7 are true. Statement 6 is false because 7 is prime, so this scenario is impossible.\n- If 6 are true, Statements 1, 2, 4 are true. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. So, having 6 true statements is not possible if we consider Statement 6.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed examination of possible scenarios\nLet's directly check the possible numbers of true statements:\n- For 7 true statements: Impossible because Statement 6 would be false.\n- For 6 true statements: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5 are true. Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 is false. This gives us 4 true statements among 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, which is not consistent.\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. We need to check other statements.\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 3 is true. Statement 5 can be true if Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n\n## Step 13: Checking for consistency with Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true. So, one possible combination is Statements 3, 5, 6, and 7 being true (4 true statements), but Statement 3 says exactly 3 are true.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluating the number of possible solutions\nLet's directly analyze:\n- For exactly 3 true statements: Statements 3, 6, 7 can be true. Statement 5 can be true if Statement 4 is false. This gives us a valid scenario where Statements 3, 5, 6, 7 are true, which contradicts Statement 3. So, we need to find a combination that satisfies all true statements.\n\n## Step 15: Final evaluation\nLet's check the scenario where exactly 3 statements are true:\n- If Statements 3, 6, 7 are true, then Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true. This means 3 true statements and 4 false statements. Statement 5 must be false because Statement 4 is false. This scenario is possible.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

We need to analyze each statement and its implications on the others.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This means the number of true statements is at least 6, so it could be 6 or 7.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states the number of true statements is 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. We need to check the validity of both scenarios.\n\n## Step 7: Check the validity of Statement 3 being true and Statement 4 being false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false, which aligns with Statement 5. We then need to check if this scenario can satisfy the other statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check the validity of Statement 4 being true and Statement 3 being false\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 1 statement is false, meaning 6 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 3 being true, so Statement 3 must be false. We need to verify if this scenario is possible with the other statements.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the implications of Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 together\n- If Statement 3 is true (3 true statements), Statement 1 is false because 3 is not at least 5.\n- If Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true.\n\n## Step 10: Examine Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, the number of true statements could be one of these.\n\n## Step 11: Examine Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's consider the possible numbers of true statements based on the statements:\n- If 3 statements are true (Statement 3), then 4 are false. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. So, we have Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as potentially true, which gives us 4 true statements, contradicting Statement 3.\n\n## Step 13: Continue evaluating scenarios\nLet's directly assess the statements for consistency:\n- For Statement 3 to be true, we need exactly 3 true statements. This scenario is checked in Step 12 and found to be inconsistent upon deeper inspection because it leads to 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 14: Check the scenario where Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true. This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and potentially Statement 7 are true. However, if 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. Statement 3 is false (because it says exactly 3 are true), and Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. So, we have a contradiction since Statement 7 cannot be true if Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 15: Analyze the truthfulness based on Statement 6 and Statement 7\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6).\n\n## Step 16: Check for consistency across all statements\nLet's directly check the possible numbers of true statements:\n- If 7 are true, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6 are true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true because one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is false. Statement 7 is false because 0 is not composite. So, we have 6 true statements, which contradicts our assumption.\n\n## Step 17: Evaluate the case where 6 statements are true\nIf 6 are true, then Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 6 are true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. This gives us 5 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6), which is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 18: Evaluate the case where 5 statements are true\nIf 5 are true, then Statement 1 and Statement 6 are true. Statement 2 is false because it says at most 1 is false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 could be true or false depending on Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false. Statement 7 is true because 2 is not composite, but this is a case where we have 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 19: Check for the number of true statements being 3 or 2\nFor 3 true statements, we've seen it's problematic. For 2 true statements, Statement 1 is false. Statement 6 is false because 2 is prime, so it's actually true, creating a contradiction.\n\n## Step 20: Summarize findings\nUpon analyzing, we find that the statements lead to contradictions or inconsistencies under different scenarios, particularly when trying to satisfy all conditions simultaneously.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Let's check if this scenario is possible.\n\n## Step 8: Check the truthfulness of other statements when Statement 3 is true\n- Statement 1: False, because there aren't at least 5 true statements.\n- Statement 2: False, because there are more than 1 false statements.\n- Statement 3: True.\n- Statement 4: False.\n- Statement 5: True, because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6: False, because 3 is a prime number, so this statement is actually true, creating a contradiction.\n- Statement 7: True, because there are 4 false statements, and 4 is a composite number.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the scenario when Statement 3 is true\nFrom Step 8, we see that if Statement 3 is true, then Statements 3, 5, and 7 are true. This gives us 3 true statements, which matches Statement 3. However, Statement 6 is also true because 3 is prime, which contradicts our initial count. So, this scenario is not valid upon closer inspection because it makes Statement 6 true, resulting in 4 true statements, not 3.\n\n## Step 10: Examine the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then there is exactly 1 false statement, meaning 6 statements are true. Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 11: Check the truthfulness of other statements when Statement 4 is true\n- Statement 1: True, because there are at least 5 true statements.\n- Statement 2: True, because there is exactly 1 false statement.\n- Statement 3: False.\n- Statement 4: True.\n- Statement 5: True, because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6: True, because 6 is not a prime number, this statement is false.\n- Statement 7: False, because there is 1 false statement, and 1 is not a composite number.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the scenario when Statement 4 is true\nFrom Step 11, we have Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 as true. This gives us 4 true statements. However, Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime, and Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. So, we actually have Statements 1, 2, 4, 5 as true, and Statements 3, 6, 7 as false, resulting in 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which contradicts Statement 4.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the number of true statements based on all statements\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements:\n- If 0 are true, Statements 1, 2, 4, 6 are false, and Statements 3, 5, 7 are evaluated based on this. Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is false because both 3 and 4 are false, and Statement 7 is true because 7 is the number of false statements and 7 is not composite but this scenario doesn't fit because Statement 7 being true contradicts the assumption that 0 statements are true.\n- If 1 is true, Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are false. Statement 7 is false because 6 is not composite. This doesn't fit.\n- If 2 are true, Statements 1, 3, 4, 6 are false. Statement 2 is false if more than 1 statement is false, so it could be one of the false ones or not. Statement 7 is true if 5 statements are false.\n- If 3 are true, we've analyzed this scenario.\n- If 4 are true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (because more than 1 statement is false), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true. This gives a possible configuration.\n- If 5 are true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is true (because 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false. This is a possible scenario.\n- If 6 are true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. We've analyzed this scenario.\n- If 7 are true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is false (because 7 is prime, this is actually true), and Statement 7 is false. This scenario is not valid because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 14: Check for valid configurations\nLet's directly assess valid configurations:\n- For 5 true statements: Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 3, 4, 7 are false. This is a valid configuration because it satisfies all true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

We need to analyze each statement and determine the possible number of true statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' If true, then 5, 6, or 7 statements must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' If true, then exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' We need to check the truthfulness of Statements 3 and 4 to verify this.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 since 0 is not considered composite.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the possible number of true statements based on the given statements\nLet's examine the possibilities:\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there are at most 1 false statements, meaning 6 or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 3 being true means exactly 3 true statements.\n- Statement 4 being true means exactly 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Check the consistency of the statements\nLet's check the statements for consistency:\n- If Statement 3 is true (3 true statements), Statement 1 cannot be true because it requires at least 5 true statements. Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 1 statement is false (6 true statements). Statement 5 can be true if Statement 4 is false, which is the case here. So, we have a potential scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 5 can be true.\n- Statement 4 being true (6 true statements) implies Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. So, we have 6 true statements: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (since 1 false statement is not composite, Statement 7 is false, but this contradicts our assumption). Let's verify: if 6 statements are true, then Statement 6 is true because 6 is not prime, it's a problem. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite.\n\n## Step 11: Examine the truthfulness of Statement 6 and Statement 7 for different numbers of true statements\nFor 7 statements:\n- If all 7 are true, Statement 1, 2, 6, and 7 are true. Statement 6 is false because 7 is prime, so this scenario is impossible.\n- If 6 are true, Statements 1, 2, 4 are true. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. So, having 6 true statements is not possible if we consider Statement 6.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed examination of possible scenarios\nLet's directly check the possible numbers of true statements:\n- For 7 true statements: Impossible because Statement 6 would be false.\n- For 6 true statements: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5 are true. Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 is false. This gives us 4 true statements among 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, which is not consistent.\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. We need to check other statements.\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 3 is true. Statement 5 can be true if Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n\n## Step 13: Checking for consistency with Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true. So, one possible combination is Statements 3, 5, 6, and 7 being true (4 true statements), but Statement 3 says exactly 3 are true.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluating the number of possible solutions\nLet's directly analyze:\n- For exactly 3 true statements: Statements 3, 6, 7 can be true. Statement 5 can be true if Statement 4 is false. This gives us a valid scenario where Statements 3, 5, 6, 7 are true, which contradicts Statement 3. So, we need to find a combination that satisfies all true statements.\n\n## Step 15: Final evaluation\nLet's check the scenario where exactly 3 statements are true:\n- If Statements 3, 6, 7 are true, then Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true. This means 3 true statements and 4 false statements. Statement 5 must be false because Statement 4 is false. This scenario is possible.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This means $T \\geq 2$, where $T$ is the number of true statements.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F \\leq 2$, where $F$ is the number of false statements. Since $T + F = 7$, it means $T \\geq 5$.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' This means $T = 6$.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T = 4$.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This statement is true if either $T = 6$ or $T = 4$ but not both.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' This means $T$ must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' This implies $F$ is a composite number (4, 6), meaning $T$ is either 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 ($T = 6$) and Statement 4 ($T = 4$) cannot both be true because they imply different numbers of true statements. Thus, Statement 5 is true if one of them is true and the other is false.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true ($T = 6$), then Statement 4 is false. This makes Statement 5 true because it satisfies the condition of one being true and the other false.\nIf Statement 4 is true ($T = 4$), then Statement 3 is false. This also makes Statement 5 true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the implications of Statement 2\nStatement 2 implies $T \\geq 5$. Thus, if $T < 5$, Statement 2 is false. For $T = 4$ (Statement 4 being true), Statement 2 is false.\n\n## Step 5: Check the validity of $T = 6$ (Statement 3 being true)\nIf $T = 6$, then:\n- Statement 1 is true because $T \\geq 2$.\n- Statement 2 is true because $T = 6$ implies $F = 1$, and $F \\leq 2$.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because $T = 6$ is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is true because $F = 1$ is not composite, so this statement is false.\n\nSo, for $T = 6$, Statements 1, 2, 3, 5 are true, and Statements 4, 6, 7 are false, giving $T = 4$, which contradicts $T = 6$. Thus, $T = 6$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 6: Check the validity of $T = 4$ (Statement 4 being true)\nIf $T = 4$, then:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false because $T = 4$ implies $F = 3$, and $F > 2$.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because $T = 4$ is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is true because $F = 3$ is not composite.\n\nSo, for $T = 4$, Statements 1, 4, 5, 7 are true, and Statements 2, 3, 6 are false, giving $T = 4$, which matches. Thus, $T = 4$ is a valid solution.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate other possible values of $T$ based on Statement 6\nStatement 6 implies $T$ is prime. Possible values for $T$ are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n## Step 8: Check $T = 2, 3, 5, 7$ for validity\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. Statement 6 is true. This gives at least 2 true statements, satisfying Statement 1.\n- For $T = 3$, $F = 4$, Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n- For $T = 5$, Statement 2 is true.\n\nLet's directly check these values:\n- $T = 2$: Statements 1 and 6 are true. Statement 2 is false ($F = 5 > 2$), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 7 is false ($F = 5$ is not composite). So, $T = 2$ is valid.\n- $T = 3$: Statements 1 and 7 are true. Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true. So, $T = 3$ is valid because Statements 1, 6, 7 are true.\n- $T = 5$: Statements 1, 2, 6 are true. Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 7 is false. So, $T = 5$ is valid.\n- $T = 7$: All statements are true. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false (because both 3 and 4 cannot be true), Statement 6 is false ($T = 7$ is prime, so this is actually true), Statement 7 is true ($F = 0$ is not composite). This gives a contradiction because Statement 4 is false and Statement 5 is false, but Statement 3 is true. So, $T = 7$ is not valid upon closer inspection due to the contradictions it creates, particularly with Statement 5 and the truth values of Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 9: Summarize the valid solutions\nWe found valid solutions for $T = 2, 3, 4, 5$.

Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the statements\nLet's simplify the statements into mathematical expressions where $T$ represents the number of true statements and $F$ represents the number of false statements. $T + F = 7$ because there are 7 statements in total. Statement 1: $T \\geq 2$. Statement 2: $F \\leq 2$, which implies $T \\geq 5$. Statement 3: $T = 6$. Statement 4: $F = 3$, which implies $T = 4$. Statement 5: $(T = 6) \\oplus (T = 4)$, where $\\oplus$ denotes XOR. Statement 6: $T$ is prime. Statement 7: $F$ is composite.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Statement 5\nStatement 5 implies that either $T = 6$ or $T = 4$, but not both. So, we have two cases from Statement 5: (1) $T = 6$, $F = 1$; (2) $T = 4$, $F = 3$. Let's check the validity of these cases against the other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Check the case when $T = 6$ and $F = 1$\nIf $T = 6$, then Statement 3 is true. Statement 1 is true because $T \\geq 2$. Statement 2 is true because $F \\leq 2$. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because $T = 6$ is true and $T = 4$ is false, satisfying the XOR condition. Statement 6: $T = 6$ is not prime, so it's false. Statement 7: $F = 1$ is not composite, so it's false. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 5 as true and Statements 4, 6, 7 as false, which gives us $T = 4$ and $F = 3$, contradicting our initial assumption of $T = 6$.\n\n## Step 5: Check the case when $T = 4$ and $F = 3$\nIf $T = 4$, then Statement 4 is true. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because $F = 3$ is not $\\leq 2$, so it's false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because $T = 4$ is true and $T = 6$ is false. Statement 6: $T = 4$ is not prime, so it's false. Statement 7: $F = 3$ is not composite (since 3 is prime), so it's false. So, Statements 1, 4, 5 are true, and Statements 2, 3, 6, 7 are false. This gives $T = 3$ and $F = 4$, which again contradicts our assumption.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluate the conditions without assuming Statement 5's outcome directly\nLet's directly check the conditions given by all statements without immediately applying Statement 5. For $T = 6$, we found a contradiction. For $T = 4$, we also found a contradiction. Let's examine other possible values of $T$ that satisfy the prime condition (Statement 6) and check if they could be valid.\n\n## Step 7: Examine $T$ based on Statement 6\n$T$ must be prime. Possible values for $T$ are 2, 3, 5, 7. Let's check these values. For $T = 2$, $F = 5$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (since 2 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 5 is composite is false, 5 is not composite). For $T = 3$, $F = 4$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false (since 4 is composite). For $T = 5$, $F = 2$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). For $T = 7$, $F = 0$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is false (since 7 is prime, this is actually true), and Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 8: Detailed check for $T = 2$, $T = 3$, $T = 5$, and $T = 7$\n- For $T = 2$: Statements 1, 6 are true. Statements 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 are false. This gives $T = 2$, which matches.\n- For $T = 3$: Statements 1, 6 are true. Statements 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 are false. This gives $T = 2$, which does not match.\n- For $T = 5$: Statements 1, 2, 6 are true. Statements 3, 4, 5, 7 are false. This gives $T = 3$, which does not match.\n- For $T = 7$: Statements 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 are false or true in a way that doesn't satisfy all conditions upon closer inspection. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. However, this scenario needs a detailed truth table check.\n\n## Step 9: Checking $T = 2$ and $T = 7$ more closely\nFor $T = 2$, we have a valid scenario as seen. For $T = 7$, all statements being true leads to a contradiction because Statement 5 cannot be true if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, but here Statement 4 is false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

If Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are true, which means Statement 3 is false because it claims 6 statements are true. Statement 5 states that exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. So, if Statement 5 is true, it supports the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the scenario when Statement 3 is true.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 6 out of 7 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is one of the false statements. For Statement 3 to be true, 6 statements must be true. Let's check if this satisfies all conditions. Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false (1 is false, which satisfies this). Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is false and Statement 3 is true, making it true. Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, but this needs to be checked against the actual count. Statement 7 is true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite. However, we need to verify if having 6 true statements satisfies all given statements.\n\n## Step 4: Verify if having 6 true statements satisfies Statement 6 and Statement 7.\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Since 6 is not prime, having 6 true statements makes Statement 6 false. Thus, the scenario where Statement 3 is true (and hence 6 statements are true) is not valid because it makes Statement 6 false, contradicting the assumption that 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the scenario when Statement 4 is true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are true, and 3 are false. Statement 3 must be one of the false statements. Let's analyze: Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false is not satisfied (since 3 are false), so it must be false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is true if 4 is prime, which it is not. So, Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 is true because 3 is not composite (it's prime), so it's false. We have to count the true statements: Statement 1, Statement 4, and Statement 5 are true. We need to check the validity of other statements.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the truthfulness of statements when Statement 4 is true.\nLet's directly check the number of true and false statements. If Statement 4 is true, it means 4 statements are true. We already identified that Statement 1, Statement 4, and Statement 5 are true. To make 4 true statements, one more statement needs to be true. Statement 2 is false because 3 statements are false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 4, Statement 5 as true. The fourth true statement could potentially be Statement 2, Statement 6, or Statement 7, but we've established that Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are false under the condition that Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the possible combinations based on the conditions.\nLet's directly assess the validity of statements based on the number of true statements. If Statement 4 is true, we have 4 true statements. The true statements are Statement 1, Statement 4, and Statement 5. We need one more true statement. However, our analysis shows that having Statement 4 true leads to a contradiction because we cannot satisfy having exactly 4 true statements with the given conditions.\n\n## Step 8: Check for other possible numbers of true statements that satisfy all given conditions.\nLet's analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 for possible numbers of true and false statements. For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6). This implies the number of true statements could be 3 (since 7-4=3) or 1 (since 7-6=1), but 1 is not prime.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the case where the number of true statements is 3 (and thus false statements is 4), satisfying Statement 7.\nIf 3 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. We need to check other statements. Statement 2 is false because more than 2 statements are false. Statement 3 is false because not 6 statements are true. Statement 4 is false because not 3 statements are false (4 are false). Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. So, Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true, which satisfies having 3 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Count the number of possible solutions.\nWe have found one valid scenario where 3 statements are true (Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 can be simplified to 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true' because if at most 4 are false, then at least 3 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims exactly 1 statement is true, and Statement 4 claims exactly 5 statements are false (meaning 2 are true). If Statement 3 is true, then all other statements must be false, which would mean Statement 4 is false. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be one of the false statements because only 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This implies that if Statement 5 is true, then exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 together with Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all others are false, which makes Statement 5 false. This contradicts the condition that Statement 5 is true when Statement 3 is true because Statement 5 being true requires one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true and the other false. So, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 cannot be true. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false, and Statement 5 can be true because it allows for Statement 4 to be true and Statement 3 to be false.\n\n## Step 6: Assess the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are false, and 2 are true. This means Statement 4 and one other statement must be true. Statement 3 is false. For Statement 5 to be true, Statement 4 being true and Statement 3 being false satisfies it. So, Statement 5 can be one of the true statements along with Statement 4.\n\n## Step 7: Check the consistency of Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 with Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true. Statement 1 is false because it claims at least 5 are true. Statement 2 is true because at least 3 are true is not met, but since exactly 2 are true (Statement 4 and Statement 5), it's actually false. Statement 6 is false because 2 is a prime number, so this statement is actually true, creating a contradiction. Thus, having Statement 4 true leads to a contradiction when checking Statement 6.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate the statements for possible true statements count\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements. If Statement 3 is true, then all others are false. This gives 1 true statement. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false (since at least 3 are not true), Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false (because it requires one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true and the other false, but Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is false (1 is not considered a prime number), and Statement 7 is true (6 is composite), which is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the number of true statements based on given conditions\nLet's analyze the possible number of true statements directly: If 1 statement is true (Statement 3), it's not valid due to the contradiction with Statement 7. For 2 true statements, we've seen it leads to a contradiction. For 3 true statements, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, and this scenario needs checking. For 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements, we need to see if any satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Check for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6)\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, 7. We've already seen issues with 1 and 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the case for 3 true statements\nFor 3 true statements, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 4 is not composite. So, we have Statement 2, Statement 6 as true. We need one more true statement. If Statement 3 is the third true statement, it contradicts because it says only it's true. If Statement 4 is true, it contradicts because it says 2 are true. Statement 5 being true with Statement 2 and Statement 6 being true is plausible because it means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. But Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true with Statement 5 being true.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed check for 3 true statements with Statement 5 being true\nIf Statement 5 is true, and Statement 2 and Statement 6 are true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then all others are false, which contradicts our assumption of 3 true statements. If Statement 4 is true, it means 2 statements are true, which again contradicts. So, having Statement 5 true along with Statement 2 and Statement 6 doesn't work if we consider Statement 3 or Statement 4 as the third true statement due to the contradictions they introduce.\n\n## Step 13: Check other possible numbers of true statements\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 4 is false. Statement 2 is true. Statement 6 is false because 5 is prime, so this is actually true. Statement 7 is true because 2 is not composite. So, we have a potential set where Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. This satisfies the condition because Statement 5 is true, and it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, which is satisfied as both are false.\n\n## Step 14: Verify the solution for 5 true statements\nStatement 1: True (at least 5 are true). Statement 2: True (at most 4 are false). Statement 3: False. Statement 4: False. Statement 5: True (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since both are false, it's technically true because it doesn't assert either is true, just that they aren't both true or both false). Statement 6: True (5 is prime). Statement 7: True (2 is not composite). This scenario is valid.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that at most 4 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of true statements is at least 3 (since 7 - 4 = 3). So, the number of true statements can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says exactly 1 of the 7 statements is true.

This would mean Statement 3 itself is true, and all other statements are false. However, if all other statements are false, then Statement 5 would be false because it asserts that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Since Statement 4 would be false, Statement 5's condition is met in terms of Statement 3 being true and Statement 4 being false, making Statement 5 true as well, which is a contradiction because we assumed all other statements are false.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the Possibility of Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are false, meaning 2 are true. For Statement 4 to be one of the true statements, the other true statement must be among the remaining 6. Statement 5 being true would mean Statement 3 is false (since Statement 4 is true), which is consistent with our assumption. We need to check if there's another statement that can be true alongside Statement 4.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2 with Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true. Statement 1 requires at least 5 true statements, so it's false. Statement 2 allows for 3 or more true statements, so it's true because 2 is not at least 3, actually, it's false because it says at most 4 are false, implying at least 3 are true.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed Check of Statements When Statement 4 is True\n- Statement 1 is false because it requires at least 5 true statements.\n- Statement 2 is false because it requires at least 3 true statements to be true (since at most 4 false means at least 3 true), and we have 2 true statements.\n- Statement 3 is false because it says only 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true if Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, which is the case.\n- Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Since 2 is a prime number, Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. Since 5 is not a composite number (it's prime), Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 10: Checking the Truthfulness of Statements When Statement 4 is True\nWe have Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as potentially true. Let's verify: Statement 4 is true (2 true statements), Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true), and Statement 6 is true (2 is prime). So, we have 3 true statements (Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6), which contradicts our initial assumption that only 2 statements are true when Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluate the Statements for Possible Combinations\nLet's directly assess the possible number of true statements based on the given statements and check for consistency.\n\n## Step 12: Checking for Consistency Across All Statements\nFor Statement 3 to be true, it must be the only true statement, but this leads to a contradiction with Statement 5. For Statement 4 to be true, we need exactly 2 true statements. We've seen that having Statement 4 true leads to a potential inconsistency when trying to satisfy other conditions.\n\n## Step 13: Analyze Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) and Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) give us conditions to check. For 7 statements, possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, 7. Possible composite numbers of false statements are 4, 6.\n\n## Step 14: Checking for Valid Combinations\nLet's directly check the conditions:\n- If 2 statements are true, 5 are false. Statement 7 is false because 5 is prime, not composite. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime.\n- If 3 statements are true, 4 are false. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime.\n- If 5 statements are true, 2 are false. Statement 7 is false because 2 is prime, not composite.

Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 can be simplified to 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true' because if at most 4 are false, then at least 3 must be true (since 7 - 4 = 3).\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims exactly 1 statement is true, and Statement 4 claims exactly 5 statements are false, which means exactly 2 statements are true. These two statements cannot both be true because they assert different numbers of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This implies that one of them must be true and the other false. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true. This would mean Statement 3 is the only true statement, and all others are false. However, if all others are false, then Statement 5 would be false because it asserts that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. For Statement 3 to be true, Statement 4 must be false, which aligns with Statement 5 being true if Statement 3 is true, creating a contradiction. Thus, Statement 3 being true leads to a contradiction because Statement 5 would be false.\n\n## Step 6: Further evaluation of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true (since 7 - 5 = 2). This means Statement 4 and one other statement must be true. Statement 3 must be false because Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, satisfying the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both).\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. Statement 5 is also true because it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. So, we have at least two true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 5). We need to check if there are other true statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check the consistency of Statement 1 and Statement 2 with Statement 4 being true\nStatement 1 says at least 5 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4 (exactly 2 true statements). So, Statement 1 must be false. Statement 2 says at least 3 statements are true, which also contradicts Statement 4. So, Statement 2 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 when Statement 4 is true\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Since there are exactly 2 true statements, and 2 is a prime number, Statement 6 is true. However, we already have Statement 4 and Statement 5 as true, so Statement 6 being true would mean there are at least 3 true statements, which contradicts our assumption that exactly 2 statements are true. Thus, our initial assumption that Statement 4 is true and Statement 6 is true cannot stand because it leads to more than 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the statements for possible solutions\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements and see which statements can be true or false based on the given conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for the number of true statements\nLet's denote the number of true statements as T. Statement 1 implies T >= 5. Statement 2 implies T >= 3. Statement 3 implies T = 1. Statement 4 implies T = 2. Statement 5 implies that either T = 1 or T = 2, but not both. Statement 6 implies T is prime (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 implies 7 - T is composite.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze possible values of T based on Statement 6\nT can be 2, 3, 5, or 7 (since T is prime). If T = 2, then 7 - T = 5, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. If T = 3, then 7 - T = 4, which is composite, so Statement 7 is true. If T = 5, then 7 - T = 2, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. If T = 7, then 7 - T = 0, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 13: Checking the case when T = 3\nIf T = 3, then Statement 6 is true. For T = 3, Statement 7 is also true because 7 - 3 = 4 is composite. We need to find 3 statements that can be true. Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 can be true because they are consistent with T = 3.\n\n## Step 14: Verify if T = 3 satisfies all given statements\nFor T = 3, Statement 1 is false (since T is not >= 5), Statement 3 is false (T is not 1), Statement 4 is false (T is not 2), and Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. So, we have Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as true, which satisfies T = 3.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. If Statement 1 is true, then all other statements must also be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 5 of the statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for 0, 1, or 2 false statements among the 7.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it must be one of the 2 true statements, and the other true statement could be any one of the remaining 6. This implies that 5 statements are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 3 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, it is one of the 3 true statements.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. Statement 4 being false means not exactly 4 statements are false, which aligns with Statement 3 being true (since 5 are false). If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true, and Statement 3 is false because not exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 8: Check the consistency of Statement 1 and Statement 2 with other statements\nIf Statement 1 is true, all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4 because they cannot both be true. Statement 2 being true allows for up to 2 false statements, which could be consistent with Statement 1 being true if all statements are true.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 5's truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nFor Statement 5 to be true, one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, and the other false. If Statement 3 is true (2 true statements), Statement 4 is false (not 4 false statements, so not 3 true statements). If Statement 4 is true (3 true statements), Statement 3 is false (not 2 true statements).\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the scenarios based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\n- If Statement 3 is true, then 2 statements are true, and 5 are false. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 6, and Statement 7 false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is false. So, Statement 3 and Statement 5 are the 2 true statements. Let's check: Statement 1 is false (not all true), Statement 2 is false (more than 2 false), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is false (2 is prime, so this is true, actually), and Statement 7 is true (5 is not composite, it's false). So, this scenario doesn't work because Statement 6 and Statement 7 are not both false.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements are true, and 4 are false. Statement 3 is false. Let's examine the possible true statements. Statement 4 is true, and since Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true), we have at least 2 true statements. Statement 1 is false because not all 7 are true. Statement 2 is false because more than 2 are false. So, we have Statement 4 and Statement 5 as true. We need one more true statement. Statement 6 could be true if the number of true statements (3) is prime, which it is. Statement 7 is true because 4 (the number of false statements) is composite.\n\n## Step 11: Check the validity of the scenario where Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements are true. We have Statement 4, Statement 5, and potentially Statement 6 as true because 3 is a prime number. Let's verify: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite). So, Statements 4, 5, 6, and 7 are true, which contradicts our initial assumption that exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 12: Re-evaluate the statements for possible solutions\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements and see which statements can be true or false based on the given conditions.\n\n## Step 13: Checking for the number of true statements\n- If all 7 statements are true (Statement 1 true), it contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4. So, this is not possible.\n- For Statement 2 to be true, at least 5 statements must be true. This is not possible if Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true because they imply fewer true statements.\n\n## Step 14: Detailed examination of Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. Let's examine possible scenarios based on these.\n\n## Step 15: Final analysis of possible solutions\nLet's directly analyze the given statements for possible truth values.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nWe have 7 statements regarding the truthfulness of the statements themselves. Let's denote the truthfulness of Statement $i$ as $S_i$. We need to analyze each statement: $S_1$: At least 7 of these 7 statements are true, $S_2$: At most 2 of these 7 statements are false, $S_3$: Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true, $S_4$: Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false, $S_5$: Either $S_3$ or $S_4$ is true, but not both, $S_6$: The number of true statements is a prime number, $S_7$: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\n$S_1$ claims that at least 7 of the 7 statements are true. This implies all 7 statements must be true. If $S_1$ is true, then all statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\n$S_2$ states that at most 2 of the 7 statements are false. This means at least 5 statements are true. If $S_2$ is true, then 5, 6, or 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\n$S_3$ states that exactly 2 of the 7 statements are true. If $S_3$ is true, then it must be one of the 2 true statements, implying 5 statements are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\n$S_4$ states that exactly 4 of the 7 statements are false, meaning 3 statements are true. If $S_4$ is true, it is one of the 3 true statements.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\n$S_5$ states that either $S_3$ or $S_4$ is true, but not both. This implies that if $S_3$ is true, $S_4$ is false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of $S_3$ and $S_4$ being true or false\nIf $S_3$ is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. $S_4$ being false means not exactly 4 statements are false, so either more or less than 4 are false. Since $S_3$ being true implies 5 are false, $S_4$ is indeed false. If $S_4$ is true, then 3 statements are true, and $S_3$ is false because not exactly 2 are true.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate $S_5$ with $S_3$ and $S_4$\nIf $S_3$ is true, $S_4$ is false, and $S_5$ is true because it satisfies the condition of either being true but not both. If $S_4$ is true, $S_3$ is false, and $S_5$ is true for the same reason.\n\n## Step 9: Check the consistency of $S_1$ and $S_2$\nIf $S_1$ is true, all statements are true, which contradicts $S_3$ and $S_4$ being false. Thus, $S_1$ cannot be true if either $S_3$ or $S_4$ is true. $S_2$ being true allows for 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the truthfulness based on $S_3$ and $S_4$\nLet's examine the case when $S_3$ is true (and thus $S_4$ is false). $S_3$ being true means 2 statements are true. For $S_5$ to be true, $S_4$ must be false, which is the case. $S_1$ and $S_2$ cannot be true because they imply more than 2 true statements. $S_6$ and $S_7$ need to be evaluated based on the count of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the number of true statements when $S_3$ is true\nIf $S_3$ is true, then 2 statements are true. $S_5$ is the other true statement because it is consistent with $S_3$ being true and $S_4$ being false. So, we have $S_3$ and $S_5$ as true. This gives us 2 true statements, satisfying $S_3$. $S_6$ is false because 2 is prime, so it is actually true, creating a contradiction since we assumed only $S_3$ and $S_5$ are true.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate $S_4$ being true\nIf $S_4$ is true, then 3 statements are true. $S_3$ is false. $S_5$ is true because $S_4$ is true and $S_3$ is false. So, we have at least $S_4$ and $S_5$ as true. $S_1$ and $S_2$ are false because they imply more true statements than 3. $S_6$ could be true if the number of true statements is prime (3 is prime), so $S_6$ is true. Thus, $S_4$, $S_5$, and $S_6$ are true, which is consistent with 3 true statements.\n\n## Step 13: Check $S_7$ when $S_4$ is true\n$S_7$ states that the number of false statements is composite. With $S_4$ true, there are 4 false statements, which is composite (since 4 = 2*2), making $S_7$ true. However, we've established $S_4$, $S_5$, and $S_6$ as true, so there are actually 3 true statements and 4 false statements, which makes $S_7$ true.\n\n## Step 14: Assess the validity of the statements when $S_4$ is true\nWhen $S_4$ is true, $S_4$, $S_5$, $S_6$, and $S_7$ are true. This gives us 4 true statements, not 3, which contradicts our initial assumption that $S_4$ being true results in exactly 3 true statements.\n\n## Step 15: Re-evaluate the statements for consistency\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements and see which statements can be true or false based on the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1 claims that at least 7 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 claims that at most 2 of the 7 statements are false. Statement 3 claims that exactly 2 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 4 claims that exactly 4 of the 7 statements are false. Statement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the statements\nLet's simplify the statements by analyzing their implications. Statement 1 implies all 7 statements are true. Statement 2 implies that at least 5 statements are true. Statement 3 implies 2 true and 5 false statements. Statement 4 implies 3 true and 4 false statements. Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true exclusively. Statement 6 implies the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 implies the number of false statements is composite (4, 6).\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements must be true. This means Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are all true. However, if all 7 are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true because they contradict the condition of all being true. Thus, Statement 1 being true leads to a contradiction because it requires Statement 3 and Statement 4 to be false, but it also requires them to be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 being true means at most 2 statements are false, so at least 5 are true. This directly contradicts Statement 3 (exactly 2 true) but is consistent with Statement 1 (at least 7 true) being potentially true, though we've established Statement 1 leads to a contradiction.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. For Statement 3 to be one of them, the other true statement must be carefully chosen. If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are false, meaning 3 are true, which directly contradicts Statement 3.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 5 is true, then it cannot be the case that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false. This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 7: Check for consistency across statements\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and see which ones satisfy all conditions.\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, all statements are true, which is impossible because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n- For Statement 2 to be true, at least 5 statements must be true. Let's examine the cases:\n- If 7 statements are true, it contradicts because Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. This could potentially satisfy Statement 2.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's consider the number of true statements (T) and false statements (F). T + F = 7.\n\n1. If T = 7, F = 0. Statement 1 is true, but this leads to a contradiction as shown.\n2. If T = 6, F = 1. Statement 2 is true. Statement 6 (T is prime) is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 (F is composite) is false because 1 is not composite. This scenario is possible if Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4 are false, and the rest are true.\n3. If T = 5, F = 2. Statement 2 is true. Statement 6 is false because 5 is prime, so this actually works for Statement 6. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n4. If T = 4, F = 3. Statement 2 is false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\n5. If T = 3, F = 4. Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n6. If T = 2, F = 5. Statement 3 is true. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Check the validity of each possible scenario\n1. T = 7: Contradiction.\n2. T = 6: Possible. Let's check: Statement 1 (false), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 (false), Statement 7 (false). So, Statements 2 and 5 are true, which matches T = 6 if we consider Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as the false or true accordingly. But we need to verify if this satisfies all given conditions.\n3. T = 5: Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true. Let's check: If Statement 2 and Statement 6 are true, and assuming Statement 1 is false (because it's one of the 2 false statements), we have a potential scenario.\n4. T = 3: Statement 4 is true, Statement 6 is true, Statement 7 is true. Let's verify: If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false. Statement 5's truth value depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4. Since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is true. So, we have Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7 as true, which gives T = 4, not 3. Thus, T = 3 is not valid under these conditions.\n5. T = 2: Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 is true. Let's check: Statement 3 being true means exactly 2 statements are true. Statement 6 being true supports this. Statement 7 is false. Statement 5 must be true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, making it valid.\n\n## Step 10: Validate the scenarios\nFor T = 6 (F = 1): One possible configuration is Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6, Statement 7 being false or true in a way that satisfies T = 6. However, upon closer inspection, having Statement 2 and Statement 5 true along with 4 others is plausible.\n\nFor T = 2: Statement 3 and Statement 6 are true. Other statements are false. This satisfies the condition because Statement 3 is true (2 true statements), and Statement 6 is true (2 is prime).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total. If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 5 of the statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for 0, 1, or 2 false statements among the 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means 2 statements are false. If Statement 3 is true, then it must be one of the 5 true statements, implying that there are indeed 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This is equivalent to Statement 3, as both imply that 5 statements are true and 2 are false. If Statement 4 is true, then there are 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the Compatibility of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true at the same time because they essentially say the same thing. Statement 5 addresses this by saying 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' However, since Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 is actually false because it is based on a false premise that they can be different.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 is false because it asserts that exactly one of them is true. Since they are the same, they are either both true or both false.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 states 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' For 7 statements, the possible numbers of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements can range from 0 to 7. The composite numbers in this range are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the Truthfulness of Statements Together\n- If all statements are true (Statement 1 is true), then Statement 5 must be false because Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true, making Statement 5 false. This contradicts Statement 1 being true because not all statements can be true.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true implies 5 true statements and 2 false statements. This makes Statement 1 false (because not all 7 are true), Statement 5 false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true), and Statement 6 true (because 5 is prime). Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Check for Consistency with Statement 3 and Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\nThis gives us 5 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6) and 2 false statements (Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 7). However, we need to correct the count: Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6 are true, which makes 4 true statements so far. Statement 5 is false, and Statement 7 is false, which fits the count of 2 false statements if we adjust our understanding to the actual true statements.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed Examination of Possible Scenarios\nLet's directly check the scenarios based on the number of true statements:\n- If 7 statements are true, Statement 5 is false, so this scenario is impossible.\n- If 5 statements are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true. This scenario is plausible as it satisfies several conditions.\n\n## Step 12: Checking the Scenario Where 5 Statements Are True\nFor 5 true statements:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is false.\nThis gives us 4 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6) and 3 false statements, which does not match our initial assumption of 5 true statements. Let's correct the approach by directly evaluating the statements.\n\n## Step 13: Re-evaluate the Statements for Consistency\nLet's consider the case where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true (5 true statements). The true statements are Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6. Statement 1, Statement 5, and Statement 7 are false. This configuration has 4 true statements, not 5.\n\n## Step 14: Final Evaluation\nUpon closer inspection, we need to directly assess which statements can be true or false together. Given the constraints and upon detailed examination, we find that having exactly 5 true statements (with Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true) is not possible due to the inconsistency in the count of true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total. If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 5 of the statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for 0, 1, or 2 false statements among the 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means 2 statements are false. If Statement 3 is true, then it must be one of the 5 true statements, implying that there are indeed 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This is equivalent to Statement 3, as both imply that 5 statements are true and 2 are false. If Statement 4 is true, then there are 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the Compatibility of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true at the same time because they essentially say the same thing. Statement 5 addresses this by saying 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' However, since Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 is actually false because it is based on a false premise that they can be different.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 is false because it asserts that exactly one of them is true. Since they are the same, they are either both true or both false.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 states 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' For 7 statements, the possible numbers of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements can range from 0 to 7. The composite numbers in this range are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the Truthfulness of Statements Together\n- If all statements are true (Statement 1 is true), then Statement 5 must be false because Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true, making Statement 5 false. This contradicts Statement 1 being true because not all statements can be true.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true implies 5 true statements and 2 false statements. This makes Statement 1 false (because not all 7 are true), Statement 5 false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true), and Statement 6 true (because 5 is prime). Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Check for Consistency with Statement 3 and Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\nThis gives us 5 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6) and 2 false statements (Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 7). However, we need to correct the count: Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6 are true, which makes 4 true statements so far. Statement 5 is false, and Statement 7 is false, which fits the count of 2 false statements if we adjust our understanding to the actual true statements.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed Examination of Possible Scenarios\nLet's directly check the scenarios based on the number of true statements:\n- If 7 statements are true, Statement 5 is false, so this scenario is impossible.\n- If 5 statements are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true. This scenario is plausible as it satisfies several conditions.\n\n## Step 12: Checking the Scenario Where 5 Statements Are True\nFor 5 true statements:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is false.\nThis gives us 4 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6) and 3 false statements, which does not match our initial assumption of 5 true statements. Let's correct the approach by directly evaluating the statements.\n\n## Step 13: Re-evaluate the Statements for Consistency\nLet's consider the case where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true (5 true statements). The true statements are Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6. Statement 1, Statement 5, and Statement 7 are false. This configuration has 4 true statements, not 5.\n\n## Step 14: Final Evaluation\nUpon closer inspection, we need to directly assess which statements can be true or false together.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' implies all 7 statements are true. Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' means at least 5 statements are true. Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' implies exactly 5 statements are true, which is the same as Statement 3. Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements must be true. This would mean Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they state the same condition (exactly 5 true statements), and Statement 5 says only one of them can be true. So, if all statements are true, Statement 5 must be false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true contradicts Statement 5. Thus, Statement 1 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the implications of Statement 1 being false\nSince Statement 1 is false, not all 7 statements are true. This means at least one statement is false.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 2\nStatement 2 says at most 2 statements are false, implying at least 5 statements are true. Let's check if this can be true. If at least 5 statements are true, then Statement 2 is one of them, supporting its truthfulness.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that exactly 5 statements are true. If either is true, then the other is also true because they convey the same information. However, Statement 5 states that only one of them can be true, which creates a contradiction if we assume either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 6: Assess Statement 5\nGiven Statement 5's condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and knowing both statements essentially say the same thing, Statement 5 is actually false because it demands a condition (one of them being true and the other false) that cannot be met due to their equivalent meaning. Thus, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false is a possibility that satisfies Statement 5 being false.\n\n## Step 7: Check the truthfulness of Statement 6 and Statement 7 under different scenarios\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's examine possible numbers of true statements: If 5 statements are true (as per Statement 3 and Statement 4), then 2 are false. 5 is prime, and 2 is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. 6 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. If 7 statements are true, we've established this leads to a contradiction. For fewer than 5 true statements, Statement 2 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the scenario where exactly 5 statements are true\nIf exactly 5 statements are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 should be true, but this contradicts Statement 5. So, this scenario is not possible under the given conditions because Statement 5 must be false, and if Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, it directly contradicts Statement 5.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the case where Statement 2 is true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true. This means either 5, 6, or 7 statements are true. We've already established that 7 cannot be true. For 6 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. For 5 true statements, we've seen it leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed examination of possible true statement counts\n- For 7 true statements: Impossible due to contradiction with Statement 5.\n- For 6 true statements: Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 need to be examined. Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is false (because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 1 is not composite). Statement 1 is false, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, and Statement 5 is false. So, we have: Statement 1 (F), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (F), Statement 4 (F), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (F), Statement 7 (T). This gives us 6 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 7) and is a potential solution if it satisfies all conditions.\n\n## Step 12: Checking the validity of the 6 true statements scenario\nLet's verify: Statement 1 (F), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (F), Statement 4 (F), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (F), Statement 7 (T). Here, Statement 2 is true because at most 2 (actually 1) statements are false. Statement 7 is true because 1 is not composite. This scenario is plausible.\n\n## Step 13: Checking other possible numbers of true statements\nLet's check if other numbers of true statements could satisfy all given conditions. For 5 true statements, we've seen it's problematic due to Statement 5. For fewer than 5, Statement 2 is false.\n\n## Step 14: Final evaluation of plausible scenarios\nGiven the constraints and analyzing the statements, we need to identify configurations that satisfy all true statements without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nWe have 7 statements regarding the truthfulness of the statements themselves. Let's analyze each one: Statement 1 claims at least 7 of the statements are true, Statement 2 claims at most 2 are false, Statement 3 claims exactly 5 are true, Statement 4 claims exactly 2 are false, Statement 5 claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is prime, and Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is composite.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements must be true because it says \"at least 7\" and there are only 7 statements. This would mean every statement is true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the implications of Statement 1 being true\nIf all statements are true, then Statement 2 (at most 2 false) is true because there are 0 false statements, which satisfies \"at most 2\". Statement 3 (exactly 5 true) cannot be true because we've assumed all 7 are true. Statement 4 (exactly 2 false) cannot be true because there are 0 false statements. Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both) cannot be true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Thus, if Statement 1 is true, it leads to a contradiction because not all statements can be true given the conditions.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 1 being false\nIf Statement 1 is false, then fewer than 7 statements are true. This means at least one statement is false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says at most 2 statements are false. If Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true. Let's examine the possible truth values.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the truthfulness of statements when Statement 2 is true\nIf Statement 2 is true, and at least 5 statements are true, we need to check the other statements. Statement 3 (exactly 5 true) and Statement 4 (exactly 2 false, meaning 5 true) could both be true if exactly 5 statements are true. However, Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. If exactly 5 statements are true, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, which contradicts Statement 5. Thus, Statement 5 must be false if Statement 2 is true and exactly 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 7: Check the consistency of statements when 5 are true\nIf 5 statements are true, Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) is false because 2 is not composite (it's prime). So, we have: Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6 are true (4 statements), and Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 7 are false (3 statements), which doesn't satisfy our condition of exactly 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the case when Statement 2 is false\nIf Statement 2 is false, more than 2 statements are false. This means at least 3 statements are false.\n\n## Step 9: Check the number of true statements based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 both being true is impossible because they imply the same number of true statements (5). Statement 5 being true means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, and the other is false.\n\n## Step 10: Examine possible scenarios based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\n- If Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, then exactly 5 statements are true. This implies 2 are false. Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) is false because 2 is prime, not composite.\n- If Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, then exactly 2 statements are false, meaning 5 statements are true. This scenario is the same as the previous one in terms of the number of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the truthfulness based on prime and composite numbers\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. For 2 false statements, Statement 7 is false because 2 is prime.\n\n## Step 12: Check the conditions for 5 true statements\nLet's assume Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), and thus Statement 4 is false. We have: Statement 1 is false (because not all 7 are true), Statement 2 is true (at most 2 false, and we have 2), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite). So, we have 5 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6, and one more needs to be false for Statement 1, which is already considered false).\n\n## Step 13: Validate the scenario with 5 true statements\nThe statements that are true are Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6. This gives us 4 true statements so far. To have exactly 5 true, one more must be true. However, we've established that if Statement 1 is false, it could work. Let's directly check the validity: If Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false, we have 5 true statements (Statement 2, 3, 5, 6 are true, and one of the false ones needs to be Statement 1 or Statement 4 or Statement 7). This configuration works.\n\n## Step 14: Count the possible solutions\nLet's directly assess the validity of having exactly 5 true statements with the given conditions: Statement 1 (False), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True), Statement 7 (False). This gives us a valid configuration.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 3: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.' implies all statements are true. Statement 4: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' implies 2 statements are true. Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements must be true. This implies Statement 3 is also true, which is consistent. However, we need to check the consistency of all statements under this condition.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 being true means all statements are true. This directly supports Statement 1. If all statements are true, then Statement 2 is true because at most 2 being false means 5 or more are true, which is satisfied. Statement 4 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true, so Statement 5's condition (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both) is satisfied because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) is true because 7 is prime. Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) is false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not considered composite.\n\n## Step 4: Check the validity of all statements being true\nIf all statements are true (as per Statement 3), then: Statement 1 is true (7 true statements), Statement 2 is true (at most 2 false, and there are 0 false), Statement 3 is true (7 true statements), Statement 4 is false (not 5 false statements), Statement 5 is true (Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is true (7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite). This scenario makes Statements 4 and 7 false, so it's not valid because not all statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 2\nStatement 2 being true means at least 5 statements are true. This is a broader condition than Statement 1 or Statement 3.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are false, and 2 are true. This means Statement 3 is false. For Statement 5 to be true, since Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false, which aligns with our assumption. The number of true statements being 2 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. The number of false statements being 5 is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false. Thus, we have 2 true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 5) and 5 false statements. Let's verify: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false (because more than 2 are false), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is false (2 is prime, so this is actually true, contradicting our initial assessment), and Statement 7 is false. This gives us 3 true statements (Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6), which contradicts our initial count.\n\n## Step 7: Detailed analysis of possible true statement counts\nLet's directly assess the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and check for consistency.\n\n## Step 8: Checking for the number of true statements\nLet's consider the number of true statements: If 7 are true, it's inconsistent due to Statement 7 being false. If 6 are true, Statement 1 and Statement 3 are false. If 5 are true, Statement 1 and Statement 3 are false. Statement 2 could be true or false depending on the false statements. Statement 4 is false because it claims 2 are true. Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4. For 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite). Let's check the statements: If Statement 2 is one of the true statements, it allows for up to 2 false statements, which is consistent with 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating specific scenarios for the number of true statements\nFor 5 true statements: Statements 2, 5, 6, and potentially others could be true. Statement 1 is false, Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Since both are false, Statement 5 is actually false. So, having exactly 5 true statements is challenging because it requires Statement 5 to be false, which fits if we consider Statement 2, Statement 6, and two others being true.\n\n## Step 10: Checking prime and composite conditions\nFor a number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6), it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 11: Assessing the validity of different numbers of true statements\nLet's directly check the possible scenarios based on prime numbers for true statements: 2, 3, 5, 7. For 2 true: Statements 4 and 6 could be true (because 2 is prime), but this leads to inconsistencies with other statements. For 3 true: This could potentially work if the right statements are true. For 5 true: As discussed, it's challenging. For 7 true: Inconsistent due to Statement 7.\n\n## Step 12: Final evaluation\nLet's simplify: If Statement 3 is true, all statements are true, which is inconsistent. If Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true. This scenario is possible if Statement 4 and Statement 6 are true (2 is prime), and Statement 5 is also true because Statement 3 is false. However, we need to check all combinations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Statement 4 is false because it claims 2 are true. Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4. For 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite). Let's check the statements: If Statement 2 is one of the true statements, it allows for up to 2 false statements, which is consistent with 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating specific scenarios for the number of true statements\nFor 5 true statements: Statements 2, 5, 6, and potentially others could be true. Statement 1 is false, Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Since both are false, Statement 5 is actually false. So, having exactly 5 true statements is challenging because it requires Statement 5 to be false, which fits if we consider Statement 2, Statement 6, and two others being true.\n\n## Step 10: Checking prime and composite conditions\nFor a number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6), it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 11: Assessing the validity of different numbers of true statements\nLet's directly check the possible scenarios based on prime numbers for true statements: 2, 3, 5, 7. For 2 true: Statements 4 and 6 could be true (because 2 is prime), but this leads to inconsistencies with other statements. For 3 true: This could potentially work if the right statements are true. For 5 true: As discussed, it's challenging. For 7 true: Inconsistent due to Statement 7.\n\n## Step 12: Final evaluation\nLet's simplify: If Statement 3 is true, all statements are true, which is inconsistent. If Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true. This scenario is possible if Statement 4 and Statement 6 are true (2 is prime), and Statement 5 is also true because Statement 3 is false. However, we need to check all combinations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Let's analyze each statement: Statement 1 claims at least 7 statements are true, Statement 2 claims at most 2 are false, Statement 3 claims exactly 7 are true, Statement 4 claims exactly 5 are false, Statement 5 claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is prime, and Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is composite.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says at least 7 of the 7 statements are true. This implies all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says at most 2 of the 7 statements are false. This means 5 or more statements must be true. If all statements are true, then Statement 2 is true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says exactly 7 of the 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true. This would mean Statement 1 is true, which is consistent. However, we need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says exactly 5 of the 7 statements are false. This implies 2 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then it is one of the true statements, making it one of the 2 true statements. This scenario needs to be checked against other statements.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true. However, Statement 4 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true because Statement 4 says 5 statements are false, which contradicts Statement 3. Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and Statement 5 is true because it correctly identifies that only one of them (Statement 3) is true.\n\n## Step 7: Check the scenario where all statements are true (as per Statement 3)\nIf all 7 statements are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true because 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because 0 statements are false, which is less than or equal to 2.\n- Statement 3 is true, as stated.\n- Statement 4 is false, which is consistent with our initial assumption that it's not true when all statements are true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, satisfying the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 is true because 7 (the number of true statements) is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not considered a composite number.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the consistency of all statements being true\nSince Statement 7 is false when all statements are true, the scenario where all statements are true is not valid because Statement 3 (which claims all statements are true) cannot be true if Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 5's implication further\nGiven that Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, let's examine the case where Statement 4 is true. If Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are false, and 2 are true. Statement 4 being true means it is one of the 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Check the scenario where Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then:\n- Statement 1 must be false because not at least 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 must be false because more than 2 statements are false.\n- Statement 3 must be false because not all statements are true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, fitting its condition.\n- Statement 6's truth value depends on the number of true statements. Here, 2 statements are true, and 2 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is true because 5 (the number of false statements) is a composite number (since 5 = 5*1, it's not composite in the traditional sense used for numbers greater than 1 that have divisors other than 1 and themselves; 5 is prime).\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the consistency when Statement 4 is true\nStatement 7 is actually false because 5 is not a composite number; it's prime. So, the scenario where Statement 4 is true (and thus 2 statements are true) is not valid because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 12: Consider other possible distributions of true and false statements\nLet's directly check the validity of statements based on the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 13: Checking for prime number of true statements (Statement 6)\nThe prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. We need to check these scenarios.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate the number of true statements being 2, 3, 5, or 7\n- For 7 true statements, we've established it's not possible due to Statement 7 being false.\n- For 5 true statements, Statement 4 is false (because it says exactly 5 are false, implying 2 are true), and the number of false statements is 2, which is not composite, making Statement 7 false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- For 3 true statements, Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is false because 4 is not composite (it's actually not prime but not composite either in some contexts; however, 4 is composite). We need to check other statements.\n- For 2 true statements, we've seen this scenario with Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 15: Detailed check for 5 true statements\nIf 5 statements are true:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true (since at most 2 are false).\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, so it's actually false).\n- Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime).\n- Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite).\n\nThis scenario doesn't work because Statement 5 is false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Let's analyze them one by one to understand their implications.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 5 statements must be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that all statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true, which means Statement 4 is false. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false. We need to check the consistency of these conditions.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The number of true statements being prime means it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite could be 4 or 6 since these are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the statements\nLet's start with Statement 1 and Statement 3. If either is true, then all statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 4 and Statement 7 (since 0 false statements is not composite). So, if all statements are true, Statement 7 is false, which creates a contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Check the consistency of Statement 1 and Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 1 and Statement 3 are true, then all 7 statements are true. However, this makes Statement 7 false because there are 0 false statements, and 0 is not considered composite. Thus, not all statements can be true.\n\n## Step 11: Examine the case when Statement 3 is false\nIf Statement 3 is false, then not all statements are true. Statement 5 being true implies that if Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 could be true.\n\n## Step 12: Check if Statement 4 can be true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are false. This means 2 statements are true. The true statements could be Statement 4 and one other. However, Statement 5 being one of the true statements creates a problem because if Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false, and Statement 5 being true supports this. But we need to check the other statements.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the number of true and false statements based on Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are false. This makes Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 false. Statement 1 is false because not at least 7 statements are true. Statement 6 being false means the number of true statements (2) is not prime, which is incorrect because 2 is prime. So, having Statement 4 as true and Statement 1, Statement 6 as the other true statements is not possible due to the falsity of Statement 6.\n\n## Step 14: Check the conditions for Statement 5 being true and Statement 4 being true\nFor Statement 5 to be true and Statement 4 to be true, Statement 3 must be false. This is consistent. The other true statement must be Statement 6 or Statement 7 or Statement 2 (though Statement 2 being true would imply at most 2 false statements, which contradicts having 5 false statements).\n\n## Step 15: Analyze possible combinations based on prime and composite numbers\nFor 7 statements, if 2 are true (as per Statement 4), then 5 are false. The number of true statements (2) is prime, satisfying Statement 6. The number of false statements (5) is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 16: Check for consistency with all statements\nLet's directly analyze the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and check for consistency.\n\n## Step 17: Summarize the findings\n- If all statements are true (Statement 3 is true), it leads to a contradiction because Statement 7 would be false.\n- Statement 4 being true implies 2 true statements and 5 false statements. This makes Statement 6 true (since 2 is prime), and Statement 7 false (since 5 is not composite).\n\n## Step 18: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, and assuming Statement 6 is the other true statement, we have 2 true statements. Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 7 are false. This satisfies the condition that Statement 5 is false because it claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both; here, Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false, but Statement 5 being false doesn't directly contradict this scenario. However, we need to verify if this setup satisfies all conditions.\n\n## Step 19: Final evaluation\nLet's consider the scenario where Statement 4 and Statement 6 are true. This gives us 2 true statements. Statement 1 is false (correct), Statement 2 is false (correct because 5 are false), Statement 3 is false (correct), Statement 5 is false (which is consistent with our setup because it's one of the false statements), and Statement 7 is false (correct because 5 is prime, not composite).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime (out of 7) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. The number of false statements being composite (out of 7) could be 4 or 6, since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 being true means that at least one statement is true.

If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false because it claims 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate Statement 5 based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Let's examine the possibilities:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false. This satisfies Statement 5.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false.

So, Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements is 3, which is not composite. So, Statement 7 is false.\nSo, we have Statement 3, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as false, and Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 5 as true. This satisfies Statement 4.\n\n## Step 6: Check if the solution satisfies all conditions\nFor Statement 4 being true:\n- True statements: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5 (4 statements).\n- False statements: Statement 3, Statement 6, Statement 7 (3 statements).\nThis configuration is valid and satisfies Statement 4.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the number of possible solutions\nWe need to check if there are other configurations that satisfy all given statements.\n- We've found one valid configuration where Statement 4 is true.\nLet's directly check the validity of other statements with the given configuration:\n- Statement 1 is satisfied (at least 1 true statement).\n- Statement 2 is satisfied (at most 3 false statements).\n- Statement 5 is satisfied (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both).\n\n## Step 8: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7 for other potential solutions\nSince Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) and Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) provide additional constraints:\n- For 7 statements, possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n- Possible composite numbers of false statements are 4, 6.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the case where the number of true statements is prime (Statement 6)\nIf Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements must be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- For 2 true statements, 5 are false. Statement 2 is false, Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite.\n- For 3 true statements, 4 are false. Statement 2 is false, Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n- For 5 true statements, 2 are false. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n- For 7 true statements, 0 are false. Statement 1 is true, Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 10: Check the validity of the configuration where Statement 4 is true\nWe've already established one valid configuration. Let's see if other configurations could exist based on the prime and composite conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements.\n- Statement 1: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that not all statements can be false.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 4 statements must be true.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that only 1 statement is false.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that 4 statements are true.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This statement implies that either exactly 6 statements are true or exactly 4 statements are true, but not both.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since we're dealing with 7 statements.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite could be 4 or 6 since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 6 out of 7 statements are true, meaning Statement 3 itself and 5 other statements are true. This would make Statement 4 false because it claims exactly 3 statements are false. For Statement 3 to be true, Statement 4 must be one of the false statements, which is plausible.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 1 statement is false. This means Statement 4, Statement 5, or any other statement except Statement 3 must be false. However, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 5 must be true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, satisfying Statement 5. We need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 4: Check consistency when Statement 3 is true\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false, and here, only 1 is false.\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements (6) is not prime, so Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements (1) is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nThis creates a contradiction because we assumed only 1 statement is false (Statement 3 being true), but we found that at least two statements (Statement 6 and Statement 7) are false. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, and 4 are true. This means Statement 3 is one of the false statements because it claims 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 4 must be true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n## Step 7: Check consistency when Statement 4 is true\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false, and here, exactly 3 are false.\n- Statement 3 is false, as established.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements is 4, which is not prime, so Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements is 3, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nHere, we have 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5) and 3 false statements (Statement 3, Statement 6, Statement 7), which is consistent with Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 8: Verify if the number of true and false statements satisfies all true statements\nWith 4 true statements and 3 false statements:\n- Statement 1 is satisfied (at least 1 true statement).\n- Statement 2 is satisfied (at most 3 false statements).\n- Statement 4 is satisfied (exactly 3 false statements).\n- Statement 5 is satisfied (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both).\n- Statement 6 is false, which is correct.\n- Statement 7 is false, which is correct.\n\n## Step 9: Check for other possible solutions\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of other configurations based on the constraints provided by the statements.\n\n## Step 10: Assess the prime number condition (Statement 6)\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). We've already seen a valid configuration where 4 statements are true, which is not prime.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the configuration where Statement 6 is true\nIf the number of true statements is prime:\n- For 2 true statements, Statement 1 and Statement 6 could be true. But Statement 2 would be false because more than 3 statements are false, which is plausible. However, we need to check other statements.\n- For 3 true statements, it's possible but needs checking against all statements.\n- For 5 true statements, Statement 2 is true, but this scenario doesn't satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4 directly.\n- For 7 true statements, all statements must be true, which is impossible because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed check for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements\nChecking each case:\n- For 7 true statements: Impossible because Statement 3 and Statement 4 are contradictory.\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 3 is false (because it says 6 are true), and Statement 4 is false (because it says 4 are true), so at least 2 are false, making it impossible to have 5 true statements if Statement 3 or Statement 4 is among them. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. This gives us a potential configuration but needs further checking.\n\n## Step 13: Final check on possible configurations\nWe've established one valid configuration (4 true, 3 false). Let's verify if there are other configurations that satisfy all given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze the given statements. Statement 1 says at least 3 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 says at most 3 of the 7 statements are false, which implies at least 4 statements are true. Statement 3 claims exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 4 claims exactly 3 statements are false, which means exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 both claim that exactly 4 statements are true. If either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, it means exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 5 indicates that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. This implies that if Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, and the other must be false.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 based on Statement 5.\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (exactly 4 statements are true), and Statement 5 says only one of them can be true, it creates a contradiction if we assume Statement 5 is true because it implies that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true, yet they convey the same information. Thus, if Statement 5 is true, it leads to a situation where it is impossible for both Statement 3 and Statement 4 to be true, which aligns with Statement 5's condition but we need to check the implications of Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the conditions under which Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true satisfies the other statements.\nIf Statement 3 is true (and thus Statement 4 is false because of Statement 5), then exactly 4 statements are true. This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 5 are true. Statement 4 is false. For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements (4) must be prime, but 4 is not prime. For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements (3) must be composite, but 3 is not composite. So, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (False because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 (False because 3 is not composite). This gives us 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the scenario where Statement 4 is true (and Statement 3 is false) is valid.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false (due to Statement 5 being true). This again means exactly 4 statements are true. So, we have Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (False), and Statement 7 (False). This scenario is the same as in Step 4 in terms of the number of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 6: Assess the validity of Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 under the condition that exactly 4 statements are true.\nStatement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not a composite number. So, having exactly 4 true statements satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2 but not Statement 6 and Statement 7.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate other possible distributions of true and false statements.\nLet's directly check the statements for other possible numbers of true statements. For 4 true statements, we've seen it's a possible scenario but doesn't satisfy all conditions due to Statement 6 and Statement 7.\n\n## Step 8: Check for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6).\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. We need to check these scenarios.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the scenario for 2, 3, 5, and 7 true statements.\n- For 2 true statements: Statement 1 is false. This could potentially satisfy some conditions but let's check. Statement 2 is false because more than 3 statements are false. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite. This is a potential scenario.\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is false because 4 is composite. This could be a valid scenario if it satisfies all other conditions.\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is true. This is another potential scenario.\n- For 7 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is false. This is also a potential scenario.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed check for each prime number of true statements.\nLet's directly analyze the feasibility of each prime number of true statements:\n- For 2 true statements: Statements 6 and 7 are true. Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. This gives 2 true statements (Statement 6 and Statement 7) and satisfies the condition.\n- For 3 true statements: Let's say Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true. Then, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 7 are false. This is a valid distribution.\n- For 5 true statements: If Statement 1, Statement 3 (or 4), Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true, it satisfies the prime condition. However, we need to check if it's possible.\n- For 7 true statements: All statements being true is not possible because Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true contradicts Statement 5.\n\n## Step 11: Summarize the findings.\nWe have potential scenarios for 2, 3, and 5 true statements. Let's verify if these satisfy all given statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' We need to analyze these statements for their implications on the number of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 implies that the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 3. So, $T \\geq 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 implies that the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 3. Since $T + F = 7$, this means $T \\geq 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 directly states that $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 implies that $F = 3$, which means $T = 4$ because $T + F = 7$.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, so if either is true, the other is also true, making Statement 5 false because it demands that only one of them can be true.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 together\nSince both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, they are either both true or both false. Given Statement 5's condition that only one of them can be true, and since they both being true contradicts Statement 5, Statement 5 being true would require both Statement 3 and Statement 4 to be false. However, if both are false, $T = 4$ is not true, which could potentially be consistent with Statement 5 being true.\n\n## Step 8: Check the implications of Statement 5 being true\nIf Statement 5 is true, then both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. This means $T \\neq 4$. Let's examine the other statements under this condition.\n\n## Step 9: Examine the case when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then $T \\neq 4$. Statement 1 and Statement 2 still need to be evaluated. Statement 1 ($T \\geq 3$) and Statement 2 ($T \\geq 4$) cannot both be true if $T = 3$, so $T$ must be at least 4 or more for both to be potentially true, but this contradicts our condition that Statement 3 ($T = 4$) is false. Thus, if $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 implies that $T$ is a prime number. Statement 7 implies that $F$ is a composite number. For $T = 7$, $F = 0$ (not composite), so Statement 7 is false. For $T = 5$, $F = 2$ (not composite), so Statement 7 is false. For $T = 3$, $F = 4$ (composite), so Statement 7 is true. For $T = 2$, $F = 5$ (not composite), Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate possible values of T considering all statements\nLet's directly check the possible values of $T$ and see which statements are true or false for each $T$. For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both 3 and 4 are not true), Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite). So, for $T = 3$, Statements 1, 4, 6, and 7 are true.\n\n## Step 12: Check if $T = 3$ satisfies all conditions\nFor $T = 3$, we have Statements 1, 4, 6, and 7 as true. This gives us $T = 4$, which matches our count. Let's verify: Statement 1: True ($T = 4$ is not true but $T = 3$ is $\\geq 3$), Statement 4: True, Statement 6: True, Statement 7: True. This scenario is plausible.\n\n## Step 13: Check other potential values of $T$\nFor $T = 4$, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, making Statement 5 false. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 3$ is not composite but $F = 3$ is not a valid reason for Statement 7 to be true; it's actually false because 3 is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 4 as true, and Statement 5, 6 as false, and Statement 7 as false. This gives $T = 4$, which is consistent.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate the number of possible solutions based on the analysis\nWe need to count how many different configurations satisfy all given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the statements\nLet's simplify the statements by analyzing their implications. Statement 1 implies that the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 3. Statement 2 implies that T is greater than or equal to 4 because if at most 3 out of 7 statements are false, then at least 4 are true. Statement 3 directly states that T = 4. Statement 4 implies that T = 4 (since 7 - 3 = 4). Statement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which seems contradictory since both imply T = 4. However, we need to examine the truth values. Statement 6 implies that T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 implies that the number of false statements (F = 7 - T) is a composite number.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that T = 4. For Statement 5 to be true, it cannot be the case that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true. However, they both state the same condition (T = 4), so if T = 4, both are true, making Statement 5 false. If T is not 4, then both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, which makes Statement 5 true because it states that exactly one of them is true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the condition when T = 4\nIf T = 4, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true. Statement 1 is true because T >= 3. Statement 2 is true because F = 3, which is at most 3. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is true because F = 3 is not composite, it's actually false because 3 is not composite. So, we have Statement 1, 2, 3, 4 as true, and Statement 5, 6, 7 as false. This gives us T = 4, which matches the condition. Let's check: T = 4 (true statements: 1, 2, 3, 4), F = 3 (false statements: 5, 6, 7). Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\n\n## Step 5: Check the validity of T = 4\nFor T = 4, we have 4 true statements (1, 2, 3, 4) and 3 false statements (5, 6, 7). Let's verify: Statement 1 is true (4 >= 3), Statement 2 is true (3 <= 3), Statement 3 is true (T = 4), Statement 4 is true (F = 3), Statement 5 is false (both 3 and 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime), Statement 7 is false (3 is not composite). This configuration is valid.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate other possible values of T based on the statements\nLet's check other possible T values. For T = 3, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (because F = 4, which is more than 3), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). So, T = 3 could be a valid solution if it satisfies all true statements.\n\n## Step 7: Check T = 3\nFor T = 3, true statements could be 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true (3 >= 3), Statement 2 is false (F = 4), Statement 3 is false (T != 4), Statement 4 is true (F = 4), Statement 5 is true (Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). So, Statements 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 are true, which gives T = 5, not 3. This is not valid.\n\n## Step 8: Check T = 5\nIf T = 5, then F = 2. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite). So, Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true. This gives us T = 4, which does not match our assumption of T = 5.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze prime and composite conditions\nFor T to be prime (Statement 6), T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For F to be composite (Statement 7), F could be 4, 6 (since F = 7 - T). If T = 2, F = 5 (not composite), so Statement 7 is false. If T = 3, F = 4 (composite), so Statement 7 is true. If T = 5, F = 2 (not composite), so Statement 7 is false. If T = 7, F = 0 (not composite), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 10: Summarize findings\nWe've found one valid configuration where T = 4. Let's verify if there are other configurations that satisfy all given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze the given statements. Statement 1 claims that at least 3 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 claims that at most 2 of the 7 statements are false, which implies that at least 5 statements are true. Statement 3 claims that exactly 1 of the 7 statements is true. Statement 4 claims that exactly 1 of the 7 statements is false, implying 6 are true. Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true, which means all other statements including Statement 4 are false. If Statement 4 is true, then 1 statement is false, and 6 are true. Statement 5 indicates that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false because it claims 6 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the scenario when Statement 3 is true.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all other statements are false. This means Statement 1 is false (less than 3 true), Statement 2 is false (more than 2 false), Statement 4 is false (not exactly 1 false), Statement 5 is false (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is actually true, which creates a contradiction), Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. However, Statement 5 being true contradicts the assumption that all other statements are false when Statement 3 is true. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true under the condition that all other statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the scenario when Statement 4 is true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 1 statement is false, and 6 are true. This implies Statement 3 is false (because it says only 1 is true), and the rest are true. So, we have Statement 1 true (at least 3 true, satisfied by 6 true), Statement 2 true (at most 2 false, satisfied by 1 false), Statement 4 true, Statement 5 true (since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, it holds), Statement 6 true (6 is not prime, so this is actually false), and Statement 7 true (1 false is not composite, so this is false). This scenario results in 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5) and 3 false statements (Statement 3, Statement 6, Statement 7), not 6 true and 1 false as required for Statement 4 to be true. Thus, Statement 4 being true leads to a contradiction.\n\n## Step 5: Re-evaluate the statements for possible truth values.\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of Statement 4 being true: If 6 statements are true, then Statement 6 must be true, implying the number of true statements (6) is prime, which is false because 6 is not a prime number. Thus, having 6 true statements is not possible.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 2's implication.\nStatement 2 says at most 2 statements are false, meaning at least 5 statements are true. If 5 or more statements are true, then Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 being true implies the number of true statements is prime. For 7 statements, possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Check for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6).\nIf the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7, we need to check which of these satisfy all given conditions. For 5 true statements, Statement 2 is true because it allows for at most 2 false statements. Statement 1 is also true because at least 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the conditions for 5 true statements.\nFor 5 true statements, 2 are false. Statement 6 is true if 5 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. Possible combinations need to be checked against all statements.\n\n## Step 9: Assess the validity of having 5 true statements.\nLet's consider Statement 5: it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true (1 true statement), it contradicts having 5 true statements. If Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), it also contradicts. So, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must be false for 5 true statements. This makes Statement 5 true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, and since both are false, it is technically true.\n\n## Step 10: Check the consistency of having 5 true statements with all statements.\nFor 5 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 5 is true (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and one more statement needs to be true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6 true, and Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 7 false, which gives us 4 true and 3 false statements, not 5 true.\n\n## Step 11: Consider other possible numbers of true statements.\nLet's directly check the statements for other possible configurations, especially focusing on the prime number condition (Statement 6) and the implications of other statements.\n\n## Step 12: Checking for 2, 3, or 7 true statements.\n- For 2 true statements: Statement 1 is false. Statement 6 is false because 2 is prime, so it's actually true. This creates a contradiction because we assumed Statement 6 is one of the false statements or not, depending on the count.\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. This is a plausible scenario.\n- For 7 true statements: All statements must be true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, so this scenario is impossible.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check for 3 true statements.\nIf 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. So, we have at least 3 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 6, Statement 7), satisfying the condition for 3 true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false,' which means at least 5 of the statements are true because 7 - 2 = 5.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2 together\nStatement 1 says 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true, which automatically satisfies Statement 1. So, if Statement 2 is true, Statement 1 is also true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true,' and Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' If Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true, which means Statement 4 is false because 6 statements are false. Conversely, if Statement 4 is true, then 1 statement is false, and 6 are true, making Statement 3 false.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This is automatically true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true because they cannot both be true due to their contradictory nature.\n\n## Step 6: Assess the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true, then only it is true, and all others are false. This contradicts Statement 5 being false (since Statement 5 would be false if Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false), but we need to check the implications. If Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4 itself because it says only 1 is false.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the scenario when Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, all other statements are false. This means Statement 5 is false, which contradicts the condition that only Statement 3 is true because Statement 5's truth value depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4. So, we have a contradiction if we assume Statement 3 is true and try to satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the scenario when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. This means Statement 3 is false. For Statement 4 to be true, 6 out of 7 statements must be true. Let's check: Statement 1 is true because at least 3 (actually 6) are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 are false (actually 1 is false). Statement 5 is true because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 is true if 6 is a prime number, which it is not. So, this scenario cannot be true because Statement 6 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Check the validity of Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is a number greater than 1 that is not prime.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate possible numbers of true statements\nLet's consider the possible numbers of true statements and check against all statements. If 6 statements are true (as per Step 8), Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. The false statement could be Statement 3 (since it's false when Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 (since 6 is not prime), or another. But we need to check all possibilities.\n\n## Step 11: Check for the number of true statements that satisfy all given conditions\nLet's directly assess the possible truth values. If Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true. Possible numbers of true statements are 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 12: Examine the case when 5 statements are true\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, it contradicts because it says only 1 is true. If Statement 4 is true, it says 1 is false, but we have 2 false statements. So, one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be one of the false statements. Statement 6 is true if 5 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 is true if 2 is composite, which it is not. So, Statement 7 is false. This gives us a possible configuration: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 3, 7 are false.\n\n## Step 13: Verify the configuration for 5 true statements\nLet's verify: Statement 1: True (5 true). Statement 2: True (2 false). Statement 3: False. Statement 4: True. Statement 5: True (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false). Statement 6: True (5 is prime). Statement 7: False (2 is not composite). This configuration works.\n\n## Step 14: Check other possible numbers of true statements\nFor 6 true statements, we've seen it doesn't work because Statement 6 would be false. For 7 true statements, Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, so this scenario is impossible.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means $F = 1$, or $T = 6$.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This implies that either $T = 1$ or $T = 6$, but not both.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The possible values for $T$ are 2, 3, 5, 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' This means $F$ is a composite number. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4, 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 implies $T \\geq 3$ and Statement 2 implies $T \\geq 5$. Both statements being true would mean $T \\geq 5$. If $T \\geq 5$, then both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 ($T = 1$) and Statement 4 ($T = 6$) cannot both be true because they imply different values for $T$. Statement 5 ensures that exactly one of them is true.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true ($T = 1$), then Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true because it says exactly one of them is true. However, if $T = 1$, then Statement 5 cannot be true because it would be one of the true statements, making $T > 1$. Thus, $T = 1$ is not a valid solution due to the contradiction it creates with Statement 5 being true.\nIf Statement 4 is true ($T = 6$), then Statement 3 is false. This makes Statement 5 true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.

This gives us $T = 5$, which contradicts our assumption of $T = 6$. So, $T = 6$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 7: Examine Statement 6 and Statement 7 for possible $T$\nStatement 6 implies $T$ is prime (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 implies $F$ is composite (4, 6), meaning $T$ is 3 or 1.

This gives $T = 4$, which does not match our $T = 3$ assumption. So, $T = 3$ is not valid.\nFor $T = 5$, Statements 1, 2, 5, and 6 are true. This gives $T = 4$, which again does not match. So, $T = 5$ is also not valid upon reevaluation because it doesn't satisfy the condition that exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the statements for any $T$ that satisfies all conditions\nLet's directly check the validity of each statement for different $T$.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. The composite numbers among these are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1 and its implications\nStatement 1 being true means that at most 1 statement is false. If Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements must be true, which supports Statement 1 itself. This condition is met if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true because both imply that at least 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 5 because if Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false, but Statement 5 requires that if Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false and vice versa, which is possible. Yet, if all 7 are true, Statement 5 is false because it says only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. Thus, Statement 4 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 4: Further analysis of Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Statement 5\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. This means Statement 4 is the false one because it claims all statements are true. Statement 5 is true because it allows for exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true. So, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true, which is consistent.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the consistency of the statements when Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. Statement 4 is false (as it's the one that's false), and the rest are true. Let's check:\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 6 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false (1 is false).\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, but this needs to be checked: 6 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 6: Check the validity of Statement 6 and Statement 7 when Statement 3 is true\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is prime. Since there are 6 true statements and 6 is not a prime number, Statement 6 is false. This contradicts our assumption that Statement 3 being true makes all other statements except Statement 4 true. So, our initial assumption that Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false leads to a contradiction because Statement 6 would be false.\n\n## Step 7: Re-evaluate the statements for possible solutions\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and see which ones satisfy all or most of the conditions.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the number of true statements based on Statement 6\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7). If 7 statements are true (Statement 4 is true), it contradicts Statement 5. So, we check other primes: 2, 3, and 5.\n\n## Step 9: Check for the number of true statements being 7, 5, 3, or 2\n- For 7 true statements, Statement 4 is true, but this contradicts Statement 5.\n- For 5 true statements, Statement 2 is true, and Statement 1 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. Let's see if this configuration is possible.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed check for 5 true statements\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 1 is false because it's not true that at least 6 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false. Statement 3 is false because not exactly 6 statements are true. Statement 4 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 5 could be true or false depending on Statement 3 and Statement 4; since both are false, Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 11: Verify the configuration for 5 true statements\nLet's assign truth values: Statement 1 = False, Statement 2 = True, Statement 3 = False, Statement 4 = False, Statement 5 = False, Statement 6 = True, Statement 7 = False. This gives us 2 true statements (Statement 2 and Statement 6), which does not satisfy our condition of 5 true statements. So, this specific configuration does not work.\n\n## Step 12: Checking other possible configurations\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of different numbers of true statements and check if any satisfy all given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nWe are given 7 statements about the truthfulness of the statements themselves. We need to analyze each statement and determine the possible number of true statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements must be true. This implies that either 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 5 statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, then the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true, and 1 is false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This means all 7 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then it contradicts Statement 3 because Statement 3 cannot be true if all statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (since they make contradictory claims about the number of true statements), Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or vice versa.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false because they cannot both be true. This satisfies Statement 5. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false, which also satisfies Statement 5. So, Statement 5 is true regardless of whether Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime means it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 since these are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the statements together\nLet's examine the possible scenarios based on the statements:\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 3. So, we check if all other statements can be true. Statement 1 is true because 7 is at least 6. Statement 2 is true because 0 (the number of false statements) is at most 2. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is true because 7 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 0 is not composite. So, having all statements true is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n## Step 11: Check the scenario where Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true. This means 1 statement is false. Statement 1 is true because at least 6 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false (1 is false). Statement 4 is false, which fits because we are checking the scenario where Statement 3 is true. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true because 6 is not prime, so this scenario is not valid if we consider Statement 6. However, we need to check the truthfulness of Statement 6 and Statement 7. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 1 is not composite.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed examination of possible true statement counts\nLet's directly evaluate the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and check for consistency across all statements.\n\n## Step 13: Checking for 7 true statements\nIf 7 statements are true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false (because it says exactly 6 are true), Statement 5 is true (because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false), Statement 6 is true (because 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (because 0 is not composite). This gives us 6 true statements and 1 false statement, which is consistent with Statement 3 being the false one. However, we initially assumed 7 true statements.\n\n## Step 14: Checking the consistency of statements for different numbers of true statements\nFor 7 true statements: Statement 1 (T), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (F), Statement 4 (T), Statement 5 (T), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (F). This gives 6 true and 1 false, which matches the condition if Statement 3 is the false statement. So, it's a possible configuration.\n\nFor 6 true statements: This is directly supported by Statement 3. Let's see if it works: If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6 (if 6 is prime, it's not), and Statement 7 (if 1 is composite, it's not) need to be examined. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. So, we have Statement 1 (T), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (T), Statement 4 (F), Statement 5 (T), Statement 6 (F), Statement 7 (T). This gives 5 true statements, not 6, which is inconsistent.\n\n## Step 15: Evaluating the number of possible solutions\nLet's directly check the validity of different configurations:\n- For 7 true statements, we have a contradiction because Statement 3 must be false.\n- For 6 true statements, the configuration could be valid if we identify the false statement correctly.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means that the number of true statements is 6 or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that the number of true statements is 5 or more, since there are 7 statements in total. So, it supports the idea that the number of true statements could be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states that 6 out of the 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This means all 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'

Thus, if Statement 4 is true, it creates a contradiction with Statement 5 being true. So, Statement 4 cannot be true if we are to satisfy Statement 5.\n\n## Step 7: Further Evaluation of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nSince Statement 4 cannot be true without causing a contradiction, Statement 3 must be true to satisfy Statement 5. This means exactly 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 8: Check if Having Exactly 6 True Statements Satisfies Other Statements\n- Statement 1: True because at least 6 statements are true.\n- Statement 2: True because at most 2 statements are false (1 false statement).\n- Statement 3: True by assumption.\n- Statement 4: False, which is consistent with our analysis.\n- Statement 5: True because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements is 6, which is not a prime number. So, Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements is 1, which is not a composite number. So, Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Verify the Consistency of Having Exactly 6 True Statements\nWe have Statement 3, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5 as true, and Statement 4, Statement 6, Statement 7 as false. This gives us 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which contradicts our initial assumption that exactly 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the Possibility of 7 True Statements\nIf all 7 statements are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is false because not exactly 6 are true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not considered a composite number.\n\nThis scenario results in 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which again does not satisfy the condition of all 7 being true.\n\n## Step 11: Check the Condition for 5 True Statements\nLet's directly check the statements for the condition where 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 for Prime and Composite Numbers\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number. For 2 false statements, Statement 7 is false because 2 is a prime number, not a composite number.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate Statements for 5 True Statements\nLet's assume Statement 6 is one of the true statements. Then, we need to find a combination where 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 14: Detailed Check for 5 True Statements\nIf Statement 1 is true, it means at least 6 statements are true, which contradicts our assumption of 5 true statements. So, Statement 1 must be false.\n\n## Step 15: Further Detailed Check\nLet's analyze:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true, which contradicts our assumption.\n- Statement 4 being true means all statements are true, which again contradicts.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Let's examine the implications of all statements being true.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the Truthfulness of All Statements Being True\nIf all 7 statements are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because 0 false statements are within the \"at most 5\" limit.\n- Statement 3 is false, contradicting our assumption that all statements are true.\nThis contradiction means our initial assumption that all 7 statements are true cannot be correct.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that all statements are false. If all statements are false, then:\n- Statement 1 is false, which aligns with our assumption.\n- Statement 2 is false because more than 5 statements are false.\n- Statement 3 is false, aligning with our assumption.\n- Statement 4 is true, which contradicts our assumption that all statements are false.\nThis contradiction shows that not all statements can be false.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together with Statement 5\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true,' and Statement 4 claims 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which we've established is not possible due to the contradiction it creates with itself. Statement 5 being true means that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 4 cannot be true (as it leads to a contradiction), Statement 3 being true is a possibility if Statement 5 is true.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the Possibility of Exactly 3 True Statements\nIf exactly 3 statements are true (Statement 3 is true), and assuming Statement 5 is also true because it's one of the true statements or because it can be true alongside Statement 3:\n- Statement 1 is false because not at least 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true if there are 4 or fewer false statements, which is the case if 3 statements are true.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6's truth depends on the number of true statements being prime. With 3 true statements, it's true because 3 is prime.\n- Statement 7's truth depends on the number of false statements being composite. With 4 false statements, it's true because 4 is composite.\n\n## Step 6: Check if Exactly 3 True Statements Satisfy All Conditions\nLet's verify if having exactly 3 true statements ( Statements 2, 3, and 5 or other combinations) could be a valid solution:\n- For Statements 2, 3, and 5 being true: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true (4 false statements are at most 5), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime, and Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. This gives us 5 true statements, not 3, so it's not valid for Statement 3 being true.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 2 statements must be true. Let's analyze the possible number of true statements based on the statements given.\n\n## Step 8: Check for Valid Combinations\nLet's directly assess the validity of different numbers of true statements:\n- If 7 statements are true, it's not possible as shown in Step 2.\n- If 0 statements are true (all false), it's not possible as shown in Step 3.\n- For other numbers, we need to check the statements' consistency.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed Analysis of Possible True Statement Counts\nLet's analyze the prime number condition (Statement 6) and composite condition (Statement 7) for the number of true and false statements:\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. But 7 is not possible.\n- The number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) means it could be 4, 6, or other composite numbers. For 7 statements, if there are 3 true statements, there are 4 false statements, which is composite.\n\n## Step 10: Checking for Valid Solutions\nLet's directly check the conditions for a few possible scenarios:\n- For 3 true statements: Statements 3, 5, and 6 could potentially be true. Statement 3 being true means exactly 3 statements are true. Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or 4 is true but not both. Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements (3) is prime. This scenario is plausible.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which we've established is not possible due to the contradiction it creates with itself. Statement 5 being true means that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 4 cannot be true (as it leads to a contradiction), Statement 3 being true is a possibility if Statement 5 is true.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the Possibility of Exactly 3 True Statements\nIf exactly 3 statements are true (Statement 3 is true), and assuming Statement 5 is also true because it's one of the true statements or because it can be true alongside Statement 3:\n- Statement 1 is false because not at least 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true if there are 4 or fewer false statements, which is the case if 3 statements are true.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6's truth depends on the number of true statements being prime. With 3 true statements, it's true because 3 is prime.\n- Statement 7's truth depends on the number of false statements being composite. With 4 false statements, it's true because 4 is composite.\n\n## Step 6: Check if Exactly 3 True Statements Satisfy All Conditions\nLet's verify if having exactly 3 true statements ( Statements 2, 3, and 5 or other combinations) could be a valid solution:\n- For Statements 2, 3, and 5 being true: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true (4 false statements are at most 5), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime, and Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. This gives us 5 true statements, not 3, so it's not valid for Statement 3 being true.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 2 statements must be true. Let's analyze the possible number of true statements based on the statements given.\n\n## Step 8: Check for Valid Combinations\nLet's directly assess the validity of different numbers of true statements:\n- If 7 statements are true, it's not possible as shown in Step 2.\n- If 0 statements are true (all false), it's not possible as shown in Step 3.\n- For other numbers, we need to check the statements' consistency.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed Analysis of Possible True Statement Counts\nLet's analyze the prime number condition (Statement 6) and composite condition (Statement 7) for the number of true and false statements:\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. But 7 is not possible.\n- The number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) means it could be 4, 6, or other composite numbers. For 7 statements, if there are 3 true statements, there are 4 false statements, which is composite.\n\n## Step 10: Checking for Valid Solutions\nLet's directly check the conditions for a few possible scenarios:\n- For 3 true statements: Statements 3, 5, and 6 could potentially be true. Statement 3 being true means exactly 3 statements are true. Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or 4 is true but not both. Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements (3) is prime. This scenario is plausible.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true, but we need to check the other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 2 statements are true because 7 - 5 = 2. So, Statement 2 being true means there are at least 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 states 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true, and 4 are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means if Statement 4 is true, all statements are false, which creates a paradox because Statement 4 itself cannot be true if all statements are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given Statement 4 cannot be true (from Step 4), for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true, and Statement 4 must be false. This is a plausible scenario because it aligns with the impossibility of Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the Implications of Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. Statement 4 is false because it cannot be true (as shown in Step 4). Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. So, we have at least 2 true statements (Statements 3 and 5). We need to check the other statements.\n\n## Step 7: Check Consistency with Statement 1\nIf Statement 3 is true, then not all statements can be true, so Statement 1 must be false.\n\n## Step 8: Check Consistency with Statement 2\nWith exactly 3 true statements (as per Statement 3), 4 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 2 because 4 is less than or equal to 5. So, Statement 2 is true.\n\n## Step 9: Check Consistency with Statement 4\nStatement 4 is false, as established, because it claims all statements are false.\n\n## Step 10: Check Consistency with Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' With exactly 3 true statements, this is true because 3 is a prime number.\n\n## Step 11: Check Consistency with Statement 7\nStatement 7 states 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' With 4 false statements, this is true because 4 is a composite number.\n\n## Step 12: Summarize Findings for Statement 3 Being True\n- Statement 1: False\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: False\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: True\n- Statement 7: True\nThis gives us 5 true statements, not 3, which contradicts our initial assumption that Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 13: Re-evaluate the Statements for Other Possible Scenarios\nLet's directly check the truthfulness of the statements based on the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 14: Checking for Other Possible Numbers of True Statements\nLet's analyze the statements again with different numbers of true statements to see if any configuration satisfies all given conditions.\n\n## Step 15: Evaluating Statement 6 and Statement 7 Together\nFor a number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), we can check possible configurations. If there are 7 statements, the possible numbers of true statements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The prime numbers among these are 2, 3, 5, 7. The corresponding numbers of false statements are 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, and the composite ones among these are 6, 4.\n\n## Step 16: Checking Prime True Statements and Composite False Statements\n- For 2 true statements, 5 false statements: 2 is prime, 5 is not composite.\n- For 3 true statements, 4 false statements: 3 is prime, 4 is composite. This is a valid scenario.\n- For 5 true statements, 2 false statements: 5 is prime, 2 is not composite.\n- For 7 true statements, 0 false statements: 7 is prime, 0 is not composite.\n\n## Step 17: Detailed Check for 3 True Statements\nWe've already seen that assuming Statement 3 is true leads to a contradiction because it results in 5 true statements, not 3.\n\n## Step 18: Checking the Validity of Other Statements\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of having 3 true statements without assuming Statement 3 is one of them.\n\n## Step 19: Assessing the Scenario with 3 True Statements\nIf there are exactly 3 true statements, they could be Statements 2, 6, and 7 because they can be true when there are 3 true and 4 false statements. Statement 2 is true because at most 5 statements are false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n\n## Step 20: Verifying the Consistency of Statements 2, 6, and 7 Being True\n- Statement 1 is false because not all 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 3 is false because there are not exactly 3 true statements if we count Statement 3 itself.\n- Statement 4 is false because not all statements are false.\n- Statement 5's truth value depends on Statements 3 and 4. Since both are false, Statement 5 is false.\n\nThe final configuration: Statements 2, 6, 7 are true; Statements 1, 3, 4, 5 are false. This gives us 3 true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true, but we need to check the other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 2 of the 7 statements are true because 7 - 5 = 2. So, Statement 2 being true means there are at least 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means if Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which creates a paradox because Statement 4 itself would be false. Thus, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 4 cannot be true (from Step 4), for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true. If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Check Consistency with Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. Statement 5 is also true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. We need to check other statements. Statement 1 cannot be true because it requires all 7 statements to be true. Statement 4 is false, which is consistent. Statement 2 can be true or false depending on the number of false statements; with 4 false statements, it's true. Statement 6's truth depends on the number of true statements being prime; 3 is prime, so it's true. Statement 7's truth depends on the number of false statements being composite; 4 is composite, so it's true.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the Truthfulness of Statements When Statement 3 is True\nWith Statement 3 being true, we have: Statement 1 = False, Statement 2 = True (because at least 2 statements are true and at most 5 are false), Statement 3 = True, Statement 4 = False, Statement 5 = True (because Statement 3 is true), Statement 6 = True (because 3 is prime), and Statement 7 = True (because 4 is composite). So, Statements 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are true, which gives us 5 true statements, not 3. This contradicts our initial assumption that exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate Statements for Possible Solutions\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and analyze each statement's validity.\n\n## Step 9: Checking Statement 4's Impact\nSince Statement 4 is false, it means not all statements are false. So, at least one statement is true.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 Together\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime, and Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, the possible numbers of true statements are 0 to 7. The prime numbers among these are 2, 3, 5, 7. The corresponding numbers of false statements are 7, 4, 2, 0, and among these, 4 is composite.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for Prime Number of True Statements and Composite Number of False Statements\n- For 2 true statements, 5 false statements: Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime.\n- For 3 true statements, 4 false statements: Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite).\n- For 5 true statements, 2 false statements: Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), but Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite).\n- For 7 true statements, 0 false statements: Statement 6 is true (7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite).\n\n## Step 12: Detailed Check for Each Possible Number of True Statements\nLet's check the statements for each possible scenario where the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, 7) and see if they satisfy all given conditions.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluating the Case for 3 True Statements Again with Detailed Checks\nIf 3 statements are true, Statements 6 and 7 are true. Statement 3 being true would mean exactly 3 statements are true, which could be a valid scenario if other conditions match.\n\n## Step 14: Checking the Conditions for Each Statement with the Number of True Statements\nFor 3 true statements: Statements 1, 4 are false. Statement 2 is true because at most 5 are false. Statement 3 is true. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. So, Statements 2, 3, 5 are true, which matches our count of 3 true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means if all statements are false, it contradicts this statement, so at least one must be true.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 2 statements must be true because if 6 or 7 statements are false, it contradicts this statement.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states the number of true statements.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that exactly 4 statements are true, which is the same as Statement 3.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 convey the same information (4 true statements), this statement cannot be true because it asserts that only one of them can be true, but they are equivalent.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime means it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 because these are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' However, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent (both state that 4 out of 7 statements are true), so Statement 5 must be false because it's impossible for only one of two equivalent statements to be true.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify Statements 3 and 4\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent and Statement 5 is false, we know that either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false. If both are true, then exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then 4 statements are true. This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 are true. Statement 5 is false. We need to check if Statement 6 and Statement 7 can be true or false under this condition.\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements (4) is not prime, so Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements (3) is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\nSo, we have 4 true statements (Statement 1, 2, 3, 4) and 3 false statements (Statement 5, 6, 7), which satisfies the conditions of Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true is valid\nWe've established that if Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, we have 4 true statements and 3 false statements. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 true, and Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 false. Let's verify:\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 5 statements are false (actually, 3 are false).\n- Statement 3 is true as assumed.\n- Statement 4 is true as assumed.\n- Statement 5 is false, which is correct because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 is not a composite number.\nThis scenario is valid.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not 4. Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our analysis. We need to check other statements.\n- Statement 1 must be true because if all statements are false, it contradicts Statement 1.\n- Statement 2 must be true because having 6 or 7 false statements would contradict it, and we know Statement 1 is true.\nSo, at least 2 statements (Statement 1 and Statement 2) are true.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze possible distributions when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nLet's consider the number of true statements:\n- If 2 statements are true, they could be Statement 1 and Statement 2. Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) would be true because 2 is prime, and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) would be true because 5 is not composite but this scenario doesn't fit. However, we should check: Statement 1 and Statement 2 being true, with Statement 6 and Statement 7 being the other two true statements doesn't work because it makes 4 true statements, contradicting our assumption. But if Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true, we have 3 true statements. The number of false statements is 4, which is composite, making Statement 7 true as well. So, having Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 true is a possible scenario (4 true statements), but it contradicts our initial assumption of having Statement 3 and Statement 4 false and exactly 4 true statements. Let's directly check the validity of having 3 true statements: Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 being true. Statement 7 would be false because 4 (the number of false statements) is composite, which actually makes it true. So, this specific distribution (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 true) is not valid under the assumption of exactly 3 true statements but is valid under a different count.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6)\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- If 2 statements are true, they are Statement 1 and Statement 2. This makes Statement 6 true (because 2 is prime), and Statement 7 false (because 5 is not composite). So, we have 3 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6), which is a valid prime number.\n- If 3 statements are true, as seen with Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6, it works because Statement 7 is also true (4 is composite), making 4 true statements, which is not prime.\n- If 5 statements are true, then Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true would imply 4 true statements, which is a contradiction. So, this scenario is not possible under the given constraints because it would require Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, making it 6 or more true statements if we include Statement 5 being false.\n- If 7 statements are true, it's impossible because Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Check for valid configurations\nLet's directly analyze valid configurations based on the prime number condition and other statements.\n1. Having exactly 4 true statements (as in Step 4) is one valid configuration.\n2. For 3 true statements: Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6. Here, Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite, making it 4 true statements, which is the same as the first valid configuration.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) would be true because 2 is prime, and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) would be true because 5 is not composite but this scenario doesn't fit. However, we should check: Statement 1 and Statement 2 being true, with Statement 6 and Statement 7 being the other two true statements doesn't work because it makes 4 true statements, contradicting our assumption. But if Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are true, we have 3 true statements. The number of false statements is 4, which is composite, making Statement 7 true as well. So, having Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 true is a possible scenario (4 true statements), but it contradicts our initial assumption of having Statement 3 and Statement 4 false and exactly 4 true statements. Let's directly check the validity of having 3 true statements: Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 being true.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the statements\nLet's simplify the statements. Statement 1 is true if there's at least one true statement. Statement 2 is equivalent to saying 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 3 says there are 4 true statements. Statement 4 says there are 4 true statements as well because if 3 out of 7 are false, then 4 are true. Statement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but since they say the same thing, Statement 5 must be false because it demands one to be true and the other false.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 5's impact\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 is false. This is because Statement 5 requires that one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true and the other is false, which is impossible since they convey the same information.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false together means we have to check the scenario where they are both true or both false. If they are true, then there are 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Check the scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then there are 4 true statements. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 true. Statement 5 is false as established. So, we have 4 true statements (Statement 1, 2, 3, 4) and 3 false statements (Statement 5, 6, 7). Let's check if this satisfies all conditions. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is prime; 4 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite; 3 is not composite, it's prime, so Statement 7 is false. This scenario is plausible because it satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 6: Check if Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true satisfies all given statements\nWith 4 true statements (Statement 1, 2, 3, 4) and 3 false statements (Statement 5, 6, 7), we satisfy Statement 1 (at least 1 true), Statement 2 (at most 5 false, so at least 2 true), Statement 3 (exactly 4 true), and Statement 4 (exactly 3 false, so 4 true). Statement 5 is false, which is correct. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is prime, not composite. So, this configuration works.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, which is now satisfied because both are false. We need to check the number of true statements. Let's denote the number of true statements as T. Statement 1 being true implies T >= 1. Statement 2 being true implies T >= 2. Statement 5 being true adds that it is one of the true statements. Statement 6 and Statement 7's truth values depend on T.\n\n## Step 8: Examine possible values of T when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, T is not 4. Let's check other possibilities. If T = 2 (Statement 1 and Statement 2 or Statement 5), it doesn't satisfy Statement 6 (since 2 is prime, it actually does satisfy it) but we need to check all statements. For T = 2, Statement 7 is false because 5 (7-2) is not composite. For T = 3, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite). For T = 5 or T = 6 or T = 7, we need to check Statement 6 and Statement 7. For T = 5, Statement 6 is false (5 is prime, so it's actually true), and Statement 7 is true (2 is not composite). For T = 7, Statement 6 is false (7 is prime, so it's actually true), and Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite).\n\n## Step 9: Check the validity of different T values\nFor T = 2 (e.g., Statement 1, Statement 2 true; Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7 false; or other combinations), Statement 6 is true, which contradicts our assumption that it's false. For T = 3, if Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 5 are true, then Statement 6 is true and Statement 7 is true. This gives a valid configuration: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7 true; Statement 3, Statement 4 false. So, T = 5 is a valid configuration.\n\n## Step 10: Enumerate valid configurations\n1. T = 4 (Statement 1, 2, 3, 4 true; Statement 5, 6, 7 false) is valid as shown. 2. For T = 3 (Statement 1, 2, 5 true; Statement 3, 4, 6, 7 false or other combinations), we need to ensure all conditions are met. One valid configuration is Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7 true (T = 5), which actually works because Statement 6 (5 is prime) and Statement 7 (2 is not composite, so false) can't both be true. However, a configuration like Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6 true (T = 3) is plausible because Statement 7 is false (4 is composite, so it's actually true), which doesn't work. But Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 6 true (T = 3) is a valid configuration because Statement 2 is false (less than 2 true), which doesn't work. A valid T = 5 configuration is: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7 true.\n\n## Step 11: Verify the configurations\nLet's directly check the plausible configurations: For T = 4, we have a valid configuration. For T = 5, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6 true; Statement 3, Statement 4 false; and Statement 7's truth depends on the number of false statements (2), which is not composite, making Statement 7 false. So, T = 5 with Statement 1, 2, 5, 6 true and Statement 3, 4, 7 false is a possible configuration.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements.\n- Statement 1: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that not all statements can be false.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 2 statements must be true because if 5 or more are false, it violates this statement.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states the number of true statements.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that exactly 4 statements are true, as there are 7 statements in total.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 both imply that exactly 4 statements are true, they are essentially saying the same thing, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false under the condition that they are equivalent in meaning regarding the count of true statements.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 since these are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7 (excluding 7, as it is not composite).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that there are exactly 4 true statements. Thus, they are equivalent in terms of the condition they impose on the number of true statements. Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, creates a contradiction because if one is true, the other must be true as well due to their equivalent implications. Therefore, Statement 5 cannot be true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 5 being true or false\nIf Statement 5 is true, then both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must be false because they cannot be true or false independently according to Statement 5. This means there are not exactly 4 true statements. If Statement 5 is false, it allows for the possibility that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the truthfulness based on the number of true statements\nLet's consider the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions:\n- If Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true (meaning there are exactly 4 true statements), then Statement 5 must be false. This scenario gives us 4 true statements.\n- We need to check if having 4 true statements satisfies the other conditions.\n\n## Step 5: Check the conditions with 4 true statements\nWith 4 true statements ( Statements 3, 4, and potentially others), we have:\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 5 statements are false, and with 4 true, 3 are false, which satisfies this.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite, it's a prime number, so this statement is false.\n\n## Step 6: Verify if 4 true statements satisfy all given statements\nLet's count the true statements in this scenario: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4 are true. So, we have 4 true statements and 3 false statements (Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7). Statement 1, 2, 3, and 4 being true satisfies the condition of having at least 1 true statement and at most 5 false statements. However, Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite, it's prime.\n\n## Step 7: Examine other possible numbers of true statements based on Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible primes for 7 statements are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n- For 2 true statements, Statement 7 is true if 5 (the number of false statements) is composite, which it is not (5 is prime), so Statement 7 is false. This gives 2 true and 5 false.\n- For 3 true statements, Statement 7 is true because 4 (the number of false statements) is composite. So, we have a potential solution where Statement 6 and Statement 7 are both true.\n- For 5 true statements, Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite (it's prime). So, Statement 7 is false.\n- For 7 true statements, Statement 7 is false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not considered composite.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the case where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since both are false, it technically fulfills the \"but not both\" condition by default. We need to check other statements.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate possible solutions based on prime and composite conditions\nLet's directly check the feasibility of different numbers of true statements:\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite). Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because at most 5 are false. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as potentially true, but this exceeds 3. Thus, we need to carefully check which 3 can be true.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed check for 3 true statements\nIf Statement 6 is true (3 true statements), the true statements could be Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 (since 4 is composite). Statement 2 is also true with 3 true statements. So, a possible combination is Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 being true, but this gives 4 true statements. Let's directly assess viable configurations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements are true, meaning at most 1 is false. This directly supports Statement 4 being potentially true because if 6 statements are true, then 1 is false.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 1 being true\nIf Statement 1 is true, and at least 6 statements are true, then Statement 4 is also true because it states exactly 1 statement is false. This scenario makes Statement 3 false because it claims exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 5 with the information from Step 3\nGiven Statement 1 is true and Statement 4 is true (from Step 3), Statement 3 must be false. Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the truthfulness of Statement 2\nStatement 2 says at most 5 of these 7 statements are false, meaning at least 2 are true. If Statement 1 is true, making 6 statements true, then Statement 2 is also true because having 1 false statement satisfies \"at most 5 false.\"\n\n## Step 6: Check the consistency of Statements 1, 4, and 5 being true\nIf Statement 1, Statement 4, and Statement 5 are true, then Statement 3 is false. We have 6 true statements ( Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and potentially Statement 7 or another configuration). Let's verify: If 6 statements are true, then Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, but this is a critical check. Actually, 6 is not prime; it's composite. So, having 6 true statements makes Statement 6 false.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 6 and Statement 7 when 6 statements are true\nIf 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. Since 1 is not composite, Statement 7 is false. So, we have a configuration where Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5 are true, and Statement 3, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are false. This gives us 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate the initial assumption and check for other possible configurations\nLet's directly check the statements for possible configurations. Statement 1 being true implies 6 or 7 true statements. If 7 are true, it contradicts Statement 4. So, 6 true statements is a potential scenario. We've established one possible configuration: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5 being true and Statements 3, 6, 7 being false.\n\n## Step 9: Check if having 6 true statements satisfies all conditions\n- Statement 1: True (6 true statements).\n- Statement 2: True (1 false statement, so at most 5 false).\n- Statement 3: False.\n- Statement 4: True (1 false statement).\n- Statement 5: True (since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true).\n- Statement 6: False (6 is not prime).\n- Statement 7: False (1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 10: Verify if the configuration satisfies the condition of being a valid solution\nWe have 4 true statements (1, 2, 4, 5) and 3 false statements (3, 6, 7). Let's check other statements' implications. For Statement 3 to be true, exactly 3 statements must be true. This would make Statement 5's truth value dependent on Statement 4 being false.\n\n## Step 11: Explore the scenario where Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. Statement 5 being true means Statement 4 is false. So, we have Statement 3 and Statement 5 as true. Statement 4 being false means not exactly 1 statement is false, so either more or less than 1 is false.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 5 being true\nWith Statement 3 true (3 true statements), and Statement 5 true (Statement 4 is false), we have at least 2 true statements (3 and 5). Statement 4 being false implies that the number of false statements is not 1, so it's either 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since Statement 3 is true, we have 3 true statements and 4 false statements.\n\n## Step 13: Check the validity of having 3 true statements\nIf 3 statements are true, then Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) is true because 3 is prime. So, we have Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as true. Statement 7 would be false because 4 (the number of false statements) is composite, not a condition that makes it false; actually, it makes it true. So, Statement 7 is true, which contradicts our initial assumption that only 3 are true.\n\n## Step 14: Conclude on the number of possible solutions based on the analysis\nUpon detailed examination, we need to directly assess the statements for consistency and count valid configurations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This would make Statement 5's truth value dependent on Statement 4 being false.\n\n## Step 11: Explore the scenario where Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. Statement 5 being true means Statement 4 is false. So, we have Statement 3 and Statement 5 as true.

This means that the number of true statements can be 6 or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 5 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of true statements is at least 2 (since 7 - 5 = 2).\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true. This is a specific claim that can be verified against the other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false. This means 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. We need to check the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 to verify this.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the Possibility of Statement 3 and Statement 4 Being True or False\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true. Statement 5 being true means that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 4 Together\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 6 out of 7 statements are true. This would make Statement 1 true as well because at least 6 statements are true. Statement 1 being true supports the possibility of Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 8: Check the Consistency of Statements When Statement 4 is True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false (due to Statement 5). So, we have Statement 4 true, Statement 3 false, and Statement 5 true because it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both.\n\n## Step 9: Verify Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 When Statement 4 is True\n- Statement 1: True because 6 statements are true.\n- Statement 2: True because 1 statement is false, which is less than or equal to 5.\n- Statement 6: True because 6 is not a prime number, this statement would be false.\n- Statement 7: True because 1 is not considered a composite number, this statement would be false.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the Truthfulness of All Statements When Statement 4 is True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (False), Statement 7 (False).

If exactly 3 statements are true, then this is true because 3 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is composite. If exactly 3 statements are true, then 4 are false, and 4 is a composite number, so this is true.\n\n## Step 15: Analyze the Possibility of Having Exactly 3 True Statements\nLet's assume Statement 3 is true. Then we have: Statement 1 (False because not at least 6 true), Statement 2 (True because at least 2 are true), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True because 3 is prime), Statement 7 (True because 4 is composite). This gives us 5 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption that exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 16: Re-evaluate the Statements for Other Possible Combinations\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements based on the given statements and verify which combinations satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 17: Checking for Prime Number of True Statements (Statement 6)\nThe prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements is one of these.\n\n## Step 18: Checking for Composite Number of False Statements (Statement 7)\nThe composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. Statement 7 is true if the number of false statements is one of these, meaning the number of true statements is 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 19: Combining Insights from All Statements\nGiven the constraints, let's directly assess viable configurations:\n- If 3 statements are true (Statement 3 true), then Statement 6 and Statement 7 are true. This gives us at least 3 true statements. We've already seen that having exactly 3 true statements leads to a contradiction when trying to satisfy all other statements.\n\n## Step 20: Final Evaluation\nLet's consider the number of true statements being 2, 3, 5, or 7 (prime numbers) and check for consistency across all statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that at most 1 statement is false. Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means at least 2 statements are true. Statement 3: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 6 statements are true. Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 out of 7 statements are true, meaning at most 1 is false. This directly supports Statement 4 being potentially true because it states exactly 1 statement is false.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 4 and its implications\nStatement 4 says exactly 1 statement is false. If true, then Statement 1 is also true because having 6 true statements satisfies 'at least 6 true'. We need to check if this scenario is possible with the other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Check the validity of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true (and thus exactly 1 statement is false), then Statement 1 is true. For Statement 4 to be true, one of the statements must be false. Let's examine the implications: If Statement 3 is false (since it contradicts Statement 4), then Statement 5 is automatically true because it states either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Statement 2 is true because having 1 false statement means 6 are true, which is more than 2. Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, but this needs checking. Actually, 6 is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 is true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements when Statement 4 is true\nLet's list the statements with Statement 4 being true: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (False), Statement 7 (False). Here, Statement 6 and Statement 7 are false. So, we have 4 true statements (1, 2, 4, 5) and 3 false statements (3, 6, 7), which contradicts our initial assumption that Statement 4 is true because it requires exactly 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 3 and its implications\nStatement 3 says exactly 3 statements are true. If true, then Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 would be true because it allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both. We need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 7: Check the scenario where Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false (because it says 6 are true). So, we have Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), and Statement 5 (True) as part of the true statements. Statement 1 cannot be true because it requires at least 6 true statements. Statement 2 can be true or false depending on the number of false statements; if 4 are false, it's true. Let's see: Statement 1 (False), Statement 2 (True because 4 false statements are at most 5), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (?), Statement 7 (?). So, we have 3 true statements (2, 3, 5) and 4 false statements (1, 4, 6, 7 or other combinations). For Statement 3 to be true, we need exactly 3 true statements. Statement 6 is false because 3 is prime, so it's actually true, which contradicts our initial count. Let's correct the count considering Statement 6: If Statement 6 is true (because 3 is prime), then we have 4 true statements (2, 3, 5, 6), which again contradicts Statement 3.\n\n## Step 8: Examine Statement 6 and Statement 7 for prime and composite numbers of true and false statements\nStatement 6 is true if the number of true statements is prime. Statement 7 is true if the number of false statements is composite. Let's analyze possible distributions: If there are 3 true statements, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite). This gives us a potential solution.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the consistency of statements with the number of true statements being 3\nLet's check if having 3 true statements can satisfy the given conditions. Statement 3 (True), Statement 6 (True because 3 is prime), and Statement 7 (True because 4 is composite) can be true. Statement 1 (False), Statement 2 (True, because at most 5 are false), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True or False depending on Statement 3 and 4). For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true but not both, which is satisfied here. So, a possible combination is: Statement 1 (False), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (True), Statement 6 (True), Statement 7 (True). However, this gives 5 true statements, not 3.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the statements for possible solutions\nLet's directly assess the possible number of true statements based on the statements given and check for consistency.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for the number of true statements\nLet's directly check the statements: For 3 true statements, we have a potential scenario. Statements 3, 6, and 7 can be true. Let's verify: Statement 1 is False (because not at least 6 are true), Statement 2 is True (because at most 5 are false, and 4 are false), Statement 3 is True, Statement 4 is False, Statement 5 is True (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is True, Statement 7 is True. This gives us more than 3 true statements, which doesn't fit.\n\n## Step 12: Final analysis of possible solutions\nLet's consider the prime numbers less than or equal to 7: 2, 3, 5, 7. And composite numbers: 4, 6. For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements is 3 or 1.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Statement 2 is true. So, we have at least 3 true statements (1, 2, 6, and potentially 7), which makes $T = 3$ or more a possibility. Let's check: Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7 are true, giving $T = 4$, which is not consistent with $T = 3$.\n- For $T = 5$, Statements 3 and 4 are true. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false because 5 is prime, so it's actually true. Statement 7 is false because $F = 2$ is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 3, 4, 6 as true, giving $T = 4$, which is not $T = 5$.\n- For $T = 7$, all statements must be true.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze the given statements. Statement 1 says at least 2 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 says at most 4 of the 7 statements are false, which implies at least 3 are true. Statement 3 claims exactly 5 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 4 claims exactly 2 of the 7 statements are false, which means 5 are true. Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statements 3 and 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 both claim that 5 out of 7 statements are true. If either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true. This means that both statements cannot be true at the same time because they essentially say the same thing. Thus, Statement 5, which says that exactly one of them is true, is consistent with this understanding.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 5.\nFor Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but not both. Since both statements convey the same information (5 true statements), if one is true, the other is also true, which contradicts Statement 5. Thus, Statement 5 cannot be true because it demands that only one of them is true, but they are equivalent in meaning.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the implications of Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true.\nIf Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true. This implies that Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3/Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 must be examined for consistency. Statement 1 is true because 5 is at least 2. Statement 2 is true because having 5 true statements means 2 are false, which is at most 4 false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number (it's a prime number).\n\n## Step 5: Check the consistency when 5 statements are true.\nIf 5 statements are true, then Statement 5 must be false because we've established it cannot be true under the condition that Statement 3 or 4 is true. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3 (or Statement 4), Statement 6 as true, and Statement 5, Statement 7 (or the other of Statement 3/4) as false. This gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which is consistent with Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n## Step 6: Examine Statement 6 and Statement 7 under the condition of 5 true statements.\nWith 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. With 2 false statements, Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the scenario where Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\nLet's assume Statement 3 is true. Then, Statement 4 is also true because they both state that 5 statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 5 being true. So, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 must be false. The statements that are true are Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4 (initially considered), and Statement 6. Statement 7 is false. However, we need to check the validity of having both Statement 3 and Statement 4 true.\n\n## Step 8: Check the validity of having 5 true statements with the given conditions.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true. This makes Statement 4 true as well. So, we actually have a situation where both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, which makes Statement 5 false. The true statements are Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6. The false statements are Statement 5 and Statement 7. This configuration is valid.\n\n## Step 9: Consider alternative configurations based on the statements.\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements that satisfy all given conditions. We need to check for other possible configurations, like 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 true statements, and see if they satisfy all the statements.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the condition for Statement 1 to be true.\nStatement 1 being true means at least 2 statements are true. This is a broad condition that is met by several configurations.\n\n## Step 11: Check the condition for Statement 2 to be true.\nStatement 2 being true means at most 4 statements are false, or at least 3 are true. This is another broad condition.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the prime and composite conditions (Statement 6 and Statement 7).\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6). So, if there are 7 true statements, Statement 7 is false because 0 is not composite. If there are 5 true statements, Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. If there are 3 true statements, Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. If there are 2 true statements, Statement 7 is true because 5 is not composite, it's actually false.\n\n## Step 13: Assess the number of possible solutions based on the prime condition (Statement 6).\nThe number of true statements being prime (2, 3, 5, 7) gives us potential configurations. For 2 true statements, Statement 1 is false, which is not possible because Statement 1 would be one of the true statements, making at least 1 true, and potentially more if the other true statement is one that supports a higher number of true statements. For 3 true statements, Statement 1 is true. For 5 true statements, we've already seen it's a valid configuration. For 7 true statements, Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 14: Summarize and check all possible configurations.\nLet's directly assess the validity of different numbers of true statements:\n- For 2 true statements: Statement 1 is false, so this can't be valid.\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 1 and Statement 6 are true. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. This is a potential configuration.\n- For 5 true statements: We've established this as a valid configuration.\n- For 7 true statements: Statement 7 is false. This configuration is not valid because Statement 7 being false (since 0 is not composite) doesn't immediately invalidate it, but we need to check all statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This means that the number of true statements is either 6 or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that the number of true statements is at least 6, which aligns with Statement 1.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' If true, then exactly one statement is false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that exactly 2 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then it contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2 because having exactly 2 true statements does not satisfy 'at least 6 true statements.'\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true. Conversely, if Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the case when Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 1 is true because at least 6 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 1 statement is false. Statement 6 needs to be examined: if 6 statements are true, then the number of true statements (6) is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7: if 1 statement is false, then the number of false statements (1) is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. This scenario gives us 6 true statements and 1 false statement. For Statement 3 to be true, the false statement must be either Statement 6 or Statement 7 (or both), but we need exactly one false statement.\n\n## Step 8: Check if Statement 6 or Statement 7 being false satisfies the condition of exactly 6 true statements\nIf Statement 6 is false (because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 1 is not composite, making it false), we have a valid scenario where Statement 7 is the false statement, making Statement 3, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false), and Statement 6 (false) true. However, this gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which does not satisfy Statement 3. Let's correct the analysis: If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false. For exactly 6 statements to be true, we need to identify which one is false. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number. So, a possible distribution is: Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 are true, and Statement 6 is false. Statement 4 is also false, which fits. This gives us 5 true statements, not 6, so it's not valid under Statement 3 being true.\n\n## Step 9: Examine the case when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. Statement 3 must be false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. So, we have at least 2 true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 5). Statement 1 is false because we don't have at least 6 true statements. Statement 2 is false because we have more than 1 false statement. For Statement 4 to be true, we need exactly 2 true statements. The true statements are Statement 4 and Statement 5. We need to check if this satisfies all conditions. Statement 6 is false because 2 is a prime number, so it's actually true, which contradicts our need for exactly 2 true statements. Thus, having Statement 4 and Statement 5 as true does not work because it implies Statement 6 is also true.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the statements for possible solutions\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and analyze the statements' truth values.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the number of true statements based on prime and composite conditions\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Possible numbers of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 12: Check the validity of each possible number of true statements\n- If 7 statements are true, Statement 7 is false because 0 is not composite. This gives 6 true and 1 false, which is not valid.\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 7 is false because 2 is prime, not composite. So, we have 4 true statements (since Statement 7 is one of the false ones), which is not valid.\n- If 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. This is a possible scenario.\n- If 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. Statement 7 is true because 5 is not composite (it's prime), so this is not valid.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check for 6 true statements\nFor 6 true statements, Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 3 are true. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 5 true, and Statements 4, 6, 7 false, which gives 4 true and 3 false statements, not 6 true.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate the scenario for 3 true statements\nLet's assume Statement 4 and Statement 7 are true, and Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. This gives us 3 true statements. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. So, Statements 4, 5, 7 (or 6) could be true. If Statements 4, 5, and 6 are true, it satisfies the condition of having 3 true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze each statement to understand what it implies about the truthfulness of the other statements. Statement 1 implies that at least 6 out of 7 statements are true. Statement 2 implies that at most 1 statement is false, meaning at least 6 statements are true. Statement 3 states that exactly 6 statements are true. Statement 4 states that exactly 5 statements are false, which means exactly 2 statements are true. Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2.\nStatement 1 and Statement 2 both imply that at least 6 statements are true. If Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then at most 1 statement is false, which also means at least 6 statements are true. Both statements being true supports the idea that 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 (exactly 6 true statements) and Statement 4 (exactly 2 true statements) cannot both be true because they imply different numbers of true statements. Statement 5 says that exactly one of them is true.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 5.\nIf Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the scenarios based on Statement 3 being true.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false. For Statement 3 to be true and exactly 6 statements to be true, Statement 5 must also be true because it correctly identifies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 1 and Statement 2 would also be true because they both support the condition of having at least 6 true statements. Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) would be false because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) would be false because 1 is not a composite number. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5 true, and Statement 4, Statement 6, Statement 7 false. This gives us 4 true statements, which contradicts the assumption that exactly 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Assess the scenarios based on Statement 4 being true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. This implies Statement 3 is false. For Statement 4 to be true, Statement 5 must also be true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, we have at least 2 true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 5). Statement 1 and Statement 2 cannot be true because they require at least 6 true statements. Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) could be true if there are exactly 2 true statements, because 2 is a prime number. Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) would be true if there are 5 false statements, because 5 is not composite but Statement 7 refers to the number of false statements being composite. Since 5 is not composite, Statement 7 is false. So, we have Statement 4 and Statement 5 as true, and Statement 6 could potentially be true because 2 is prime. This gives us a possible scenario where Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true.\n\n## Step 7: Check the validity of the scenario where Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true.\nIf Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true, then exactly 2 statements are true (from Statement 4), and the number of true statements is prime (from Statement 6), which is satisfied because 2 is prime. Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 7 are false. This scenario is plausible because it satisfies the conditions of Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 being true.\n\n## Step 8: Verify if there are other possible combinations.\nLet's directly check the truthfulness of statements based on possible numbers of true statements and see if any other configuration satisfies all given conditions.\n\n## Step 9: Checking for the number of true statements being 7.\nIf all 7 statements are true, then Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 3 are true, but this creates a contradiction because Statement 3 says exactly 6 are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 2 are true, making Statement 5 false because it cannot be that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true exclusively if both are false. Thus, having all 7 true is not possible due to the contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 10: Checking for the number of true statements being 6.\nWe've already analyzed this scenario in Step 5 and found it doesn't work out.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for the number of true statements being 2.\nAs analyzed in Step 6 and Step 7, having exactly 2 true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 5, and potentially Statement 6) is a valid scenario.\n\n## Step 12: Summarize the findings.\nFrom the analysis, having exactly 2 true statements (Statement 4, Statement 5, and potentially Statement 6) is a valid configuration. Let's verify: If Statement 4 and Statement 5 are true, Statement 6 is also true because 2 is a prime number. This makes 3 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption of exactly 2 true statements. So, the valid configuration is not exactly 2 true statements if we include Statement 6 as true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 1 and Statement 2\nBoth Statement 1 and Statement 2 imply that the number of true statements is either 6 or 7. If 7 statements are true, then Statement 4 is false, and Statement 3 is true. Statement 5's truthfulness depends on the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4.

If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false.\n\n## Step 10: Check the scenario where 7 statements are true\nIf all 7 statements are true, then Statement 4 is false, which contradicts the assumption that all statements are true. Thus, it's not possible for all 7 statements to be true.\n\n## Step 11: Check the scenario where 6 statements are true\nIf 6 statements are true, then Statement 3 is true (because it says exactly 6 are true), and Statement 4 is false. Statement 1 is true because at least 6 are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 1 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true if 6 is prime, but 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is true if 1 (the number of false statements) is composite, but 1 is not composite. So, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed check for 6 true statements\nLet's examine the statements when 6 are true: Statement 3 is true. For 6 statements to be true, Statement 6 being false (since 6 is not prime) is a possibility. This makes Statement 3, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite, this is false), and another statement true, and Statement 6 and Statement 4 or Statement 7 false. But if Statement 7 is false, it means the number of false statements (1) is not composite, which is true, so Statement 7 being false is actually consistent with having 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 13: Check consistency with Statement 6 being false\nIf Statement 6 is false, then the number of true statements (6) is not prime, which is true because 6 is not prime. So, Statement 6 being false is consistent with 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate the consistency of statements when 6 are true and Statement 6 is false\n- Statement 1: True (at least 6 true)\n- Statement 2: True (at most 1 false)\n- Statement 3: True (exactly 6 true)\n- Statement 4: False (not exactly 5 false)\n- Statement 5: True (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both)\n- Statement 6: False (6 is not prime)\n- Statement 7: False (1 is not composite)\n\nThis gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which contradicts our initial assumption of 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 15: Re-evaluate the statements for other possible configurations\nLet's directly assess the validity of each statement under different configurations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

However, the condition \"but not both\" is satisfied when both are false, making Statement 5 true.\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements (7) is not a prime number, it's a specific count, and 7 is indeed prime, so it's true.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements (0) is not composite; 0 is considered neither prime nor composite, so it's false.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the validity of all statements being true\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, and Statement 7 is false, we have at least 3 false statements, which contradicts Statement 2. Thus, not all statements can be true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 2 being false\nSince Statement 2 cannot be true (as it leads to a contradiction), it must be false. This means there is at least 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the possible number of true statements based on the given statements\nLet's analyze the statements again with the knowledge that Statement 2 is false.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate Statement 1\nStatement 1 says at least 4 statements are true. If it's true, then we have at least 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's directly examine the possible scenarios based on the constraints given by the statements.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the statements for different numbers of true statements\n- For 7 true statements, we've established it's not possible due to contradictions.\n- For 6 true statements, Statement 2 is false, and we have 1 false statement. Statement 1 is true (at least 4 true), Statement 3 is false (not exactly 4 true), Statement 4 is false (not exactly 3 false), Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 and 4 are false, it holds), Statement 6 is true (6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (1 is not composite). So, Statements 1, 5 are true, and Statements 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 are false or true accordingly. This gives us a potential configuration but let's check the conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Check the conditions for 6 true statements\nIf Statement 6 is one of the false statements, then the number of true statements (6) is not prime, which is correct, making Statement 6 false. So, we could have Statements 1, 5, and others being true or false. Let's directly check feasible configurations.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate feasible configurations based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 (Exactly 4 true) and Statement 4 (Exactly 3 false, or 4 true) can both be true if there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 13: Check the case where exactly 4 statements are true\nIf exactly 4 statements are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true. Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, so it must be false. Statement 1 is true because at least 4 statements are true. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite, it's actually true that 3 is not composite but it's prime, and the statement about being composite is false. So, we have Statements 1, 3, 4, and 7 as potentially true.\n\n## Step 14: Assess the truthfulness for exactly 4 true statements\nFor exactly 4 true statements: Statements 1, 3, 4, and 7 being true satisfies the condition. Statement 2 is false, Statement 5 is false, and Statement 6 is false. This configuration is: Statements 1, 3, 4, 7 are true, and Statements 2, 5, 6 are false, which matches our condition of exactly 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 15: Check other possible configurations\nLet's check for other configurations like 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 16: Evaluate the configuration for 5 true statements\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 1 is true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 6 is true if 5 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite (it's prime). So, we have Statements 1, 5, 6 as true. This gives us a potential configuration.\n\n## Step 7: Final evaluation of possible solutions\nWe need to systematically check the validity of different configurations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This implies that all 7 statements are true because it asserts that there are no false statements among them.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the Implication of Statement 2 Being True\nIf Statement 2 is true, then all 7 statements must be true. We need to check if this scenario is possible by verifying if it satisfies all other statements.\n\n## Step 3: Check if All Statements Can Be True\n- Statement 1: If all 7 statements are true, then at least 4 of them are true, so Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2: As assumed, it's true.\n- Statement 3: If all 7 statements are true, then exactly 7 are true, not 4, so Statement 3 is false. This contradicts our assumption that all statements are true.\nSince Statement 3 is false when all statements are true, our initial assumption that all statements can be true is incorrect.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the Truthfulness of Statement 2 Being False\nGiven that Statement 2 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction (Statement 3 being false), it must be false. This means there is at least one false statement among the 7.\n\n## Step 5: Examine Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Let's denote the number of true statements as $T$. Then, $T \\geq 4$.\n\n## Step 6: Examine Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' So, $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 7: Examine Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T = 7 - 3 = 4$. Thus, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent and both imply $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, they are either both true or both false. Thus, Statement 5 must be false because it demands that only one of them is true.\n\n## Step 9: Assess the Implications of Statement 5 Being False\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we know both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must have the same truth value. Given they are equivalent, they should both be true or both be false. But if both are true, then $T = 4$, and Statement 5 being false is consistent with our findings.\n\n## Step 10: Check the Consistency of $T = 4$\nIf $T = 4$, then:\n- Statement 1 is true because $4 \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 2 is false because not all statements are true.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6: $T = 4$ is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements is $7 - 4 = 3$, which is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 11: Verify the Number of True Statements When $T = 4$\nWe have Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4 as true, and Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as false, giving us $T = 3$, which contradicts our assumption that $T = 4$. Thus, $T = 4$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 12: Explore Other Possible Values of $T$\nLet's examine other possibilities based on the statements:\n- For $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is true if $T = 5$ is prime (which it is not), so Statement 6 is false.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed Check for $T = 5$\nIf $T = 5$:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 5 is prime, actually making it true.\n- Statement 7 is false because $7 - 5 = 2$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate $T = 5$ Further\nFor $T = 5$, we have:\n- True: Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 6.\n- False: Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 7.\nThis gives $T = 3$, not 5, so $T = 5$ is not a solution.\n\n## Step 15: Check for $T = 6$ and $T = 7$\nFor $T = 6$ or $T = 7$, we've already established that $T = 7$ is not possible. For $T = 6$:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is true because $7 - 6 = 1$ is not composite, actually it's true that 1 is not composite but it's a special case, and Statement 7 is about being composite.\n\n## Step 16: Detailed Evaluation for $T = 6$ and $T = 7$\nFor $T = 6$:\n- True: Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 7.\n- False: Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6.\nThis results in $T = 3$, which does not match $T = 6$.\n\nFor $T = 7$, we've already determined it's not possible due to the contradiction with Statement 3.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's understand and possibly simplify the given statements.\n- Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that the number of true statements is 4 or more.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This means all 7 statements must be true.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This gives a specific count of true statements.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that exactly 4 statements are true, as there are 7 statements in total.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (4 true statements), this statement creates a contradiction if either Statement 3 or 4 is true because it asserts that only one of them can be true, but they are equivalent.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6, since 0 is not considered composite.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false,' which means all statements must be true. If all 7 statements are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true because 7 is at least 4.\n- Statement 2 is true because 0 statements are false.\n- Statement 3 is false because exactly 4 statements are not true; 7 are true.\n- Statement 4 is false for the same reason as Statement 3; it's not exactly 4 true statements.\n- Statement 5 is true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, making the \"but not both\" condition technically satisfied since neither is true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 3: Check the validity of all statements being true\nIf all statements are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, which contradicts the assumption that all statements are true. Thus, not all 7 statements can be true, making Statement 2 false.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the implications of Statement 2 being false\nSince Statement 2 is false, at least one statement must be false. This means we have to examine the other statements to find possible combinations that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n## Step 5: Examine Statement 1 and its implications\nStatement 1 says at least 4 statements are true. If Statement 1 is true, then we need at least 4 true statements. Let's examine the cases where Statement 1 is true and where it's false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the case when Statement 1 is false\nIf Statement 1 is false, then fewer than 4 statements are true. This means 3 or fewer statements are true, implying 4 or more are false. Let's check if this satisfies other conditions.\n\n## Step 7: Check the conditions for 3 or fewer true statements\nFor 3 or fewer true statements:\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false because they assert exactly 4 true statements.\n- Statement 5's truth value depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4. Since both are false, Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, which is satisfied as neither is true.\n- For 3 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 3 is prime, so this case is not valid if Statement 6 is one of the true statements.\n- For 3 true statements, Statement 7 is true because 4 (the number of false statements) is composite.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of different numbers of true statements:\n- If 7 statements are true, Statement 2 is true, but this leads to a contradiction as seen in Step 3.\n- For 6 true statements, Statement 1 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (since both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is false (because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 1 is not composite, this statement is false). So, 6 true statements don't satisfy all conditions because Statement 6 and Statement 7 cannot both be true in this scenario.\n- For 5 true statements, Statement 1 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true (because 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 2 is not composite, this statement is false). So, this scenario is not valid.\n- For 4 true statements, Statement 1 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both 3 and 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 3 is not composite, this statement is false). So, we need to check the combination.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed check for 4 true statements\nFor exactly 4 true statements:\n- Statement 1 must be true.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\n\nThe true statements could be 1, 3, 4, and one other. But given Statement 5 is false, and both 3 and 4 are true, the other true statement must be Statement 1 (already counted). So, we have to find another true statement. If Statement 2 is true, it contradicts our count. If Statement 6 or 7 is true, it also doesn't fit because they are not true when there are 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Assess the validity of having exactly 4 true statements with the given constraints\nUpon closer inspection, having exactly 4 true statements ( Statements 1, 3, 4, and potentially another) is challenging due to the constraints. Statement 2 cannot be one of them because it asserts all statements are true. Let's directly check feasible combinations.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means the number of true statements (T) is $T \\geq 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says, 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that there are 0 false statements, so $T = 7$ because there are 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says, 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' So, $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says, 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means $T = 7 - 3 = 4$ because there are 7 statements.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says, 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, if either is true, the other must be true as well because they both state the same condition ($T = 4$) indirectly. Thus, Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true because it demands exclusivity.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says, 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says, 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The number of false statements is $7 - T$. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $7 - T = 4$ or $6$, implying $T = 3$ or $1$. Since $T = 1$ is not possible because it doesn't satisfy being a prime (though 1 is a special case and not considered prime in most mathematical contexts), $T = 3$ is the relevant solution here.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the implications of Statement 2 being true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then $T = 7$. This makes all statements true. However, we need to check if this satisfies all statements. Statement 1 is true because $T = 7 \\geq 3$. Statement 3 is false because $T \\neq 4$. Statement 4 is false because $T \\neq 4$. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, so it's not \"either true but not both.\" Statement 6 is true because $T = 7$ is prime. Statement 7 is false because $7 - T = 0$, and 0 is not composite. So, having $T = 7$ makes Statements 1, 2, and 6 true, and Statements 3, 4, 5, and 7 false. This gives us $T = 3$, which contradicts $T = 7$. Thus, $T = 7$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 10: Check for $T = 4$ as implied by Statements 3 and 4\nIf $T = 4$, then Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both 3 and 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because $7 - T = 3$, which is not composite). So, we have Statements 1, 3, 4, and 7 being true, which gives $T = 4$. This is a valid scenario because it satisfies the condition that $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 11: Check for other possible values of $T$ based on Statement 6\nFor $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is false (because 2 is prime, this statement is actually true), and Statement 7 is false (because $7 - T = 5$, which is not composite). So, $T = 2$ is not valid because Statement 6 is true, making $T = 3$ or more a possibility to consider for Statement 6 being true.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate $T = 3$ based on Statement 7 and other conditions\nFor $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (since both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (because 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (because $7 - T = 4$, which is composite). So, Statements 1, 5, 6, and 7 are true, giving $T = 4$, which contradicts $T = 3$. Thus, $T = 3$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate $T = 5$ based on Statement 6\nFor $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. So, we have $T = 4$ (from Statements 1, 5, and 6 being true), which again is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 14: Summarize findings\nWe've found that $T = 4$ is a valid solution where Statements 1, 3, 4, and 7 are true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

So, $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says, 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means $T = 7 - 3 = 4$ because there are 7 statements.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says, 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, if either is true, the other must be true as well because they both state the same condition ($T = 4$) indirectly. Thus, Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true because it demands exclusivity.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says, 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says, 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The number of false statements is $7 - T$. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $7 - T = 4$ or $6$, implying $T = 3$ or $1$. Since $T = 1$ is not possible because it doesn't satisfy being a prime (though 1 is a special case and not considered prime in most mathematical contexts), $T = 3$ is the relevant solution here.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the implications of Statement 2 being true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then $T = 7$. This makes all statements true. However, we need to check if this satisfies all statements. Statement 1 is true because $T = 7 \\geq 3$. Statement 3 is false because $T \\neq 4$. Statement 4 is false because $T \\neq 4$. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, so it's not \"either true but not both.\" Statement 6 is true because $T = 7$ is prime. Statement 7 is false because $7 - T = 0$, and 0 is not composite. So, having $T = 7$ makes Statements 1, 2, and 6 true, and Statements 3, 4, 5, and 7 false. This gives us $T = 3$, which contradicts $T = 7$. Thus, $T = 7$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 10: Check for $T = 4$ as implied by Statements 3 and 4\nIf $T = 4$, then Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both 3 and 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because $7 - T = 3$, which is not composite). So, we have Statements 1, 3, 4, and 7 being true, which gives $T = 4$. This is a valid scenario because it satisfies the condition that $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 11: Check for other possible values of $T$ based on Statement 6\nFor $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is false (because 2 is prime, this statement is actually true), and Statement 7 is false (because $7 - T = 5$, which is not composite). So, $T = 2$ is not valid because Statement 6 is true, making $T = 3$ or more a possibility to consider for Statement 6 being true.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate $T = 3$ based on Statement 7 and other conditions\nFor $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (since both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (because 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (because $7 - T = 4$, which is composite). So, Statements 1, 5, 6, and 7 are true, giving $T = 4$, which contradicts $T = 3$. Thus, $T = 3$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate $T = 5$ based on Statement 6\nFor $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. So, we have $T = 4$ (from Statements 1, 5, and 6 being true), which again is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 14: Summarize findings\nWe've found that $T = 4$ is a valid solution where Statements 1, 3, 4, and 7 are true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This implies all 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This is equivalent to saying exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, this statement cannot be true because it asserts that only one of them can be true, but they convey the same information.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false,' which means all statements must be true. If all 7 statements are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true because 7 is at least 3.\n- Statement 2 is true because 0 statements are false.\n- Statement 3 is true because exactly 4 statements are not true, so this creates a contradiction.\n- Statement 4 is true for the same reason as Statement 3, creating a contradiction because it implies exactly 4 statements are true.\n- Statement 5 cannot be true because Statements 3 and 4 are equivalent, making it false.\nThis scenario is impossible because Statement 5 cannot be true if all statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 5 being false\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, the falsity of Statement 5 means both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are either true or false together. Given they are equivalent, they are either both true or both false.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the case when Statements 3 and 4 are true\nIf Statements 3 and 4 are true, then exactly 4 statements are true. This means 3 statements are false. Let's list the statements and their truth values:\n- Statement 1: True (because at least 3 are true)\n- Statement 2: False (because not all statements are true)\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: False (as deduced)\n- Statement 6: False (because 4 is not a prime number)\n- Statement 7: True (because 3 is not composite, this statement is false; a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. 3 is not composite, it's prime)\n\n## Step 5: Check the validity of having exactly 4 true statements\nLet's check if having exactly 4 true statements satisfies all conditions:\n- Statements 1, 3, 4 are true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\nThis gives us 3 true statements (1, 3, 4) and 4 false statements (2, 5, 6, 7), which does not satisfy the condition of exactly 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the scenario when Statements 3 and 4 are false\nIf Statements 3 and 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not 4. Let's examine the possible number of true statements:\n- Statement 1 must be true because if fewer than 3 statements are true, it would be false, creating a contradiction if it's one of the true statements.\n- Statement 6 being true implies the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n## Step 7: Examine possible numbers of true statements based on Statement 6\nLet's check the possibilities based on Statement 6:\n- If 7 statements are true, we've already established this is impossible due to Statement 5 being false.\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 7 would be false because 2 is not composite. This scenario could potentially work.\n- If 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. Statement 7 would be true because 4 is composite. This is a potential scenario.\n- If 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. Statement 7 would be true because 5 is not composite (it's prime), so this statement would be false.\n\n## Step 8: Check the validity of having 5 true statements\nFor 5 true statements:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true (because 5 is prime).\n- Statement 7 is false (because 2 is not composite).\n\nThis gives us 3 true statements (1, 6) and 4 false statements (2, 3, 4, 5, 7), which doesn't match our assumption of 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Check the validity of having 3 true statements\nFor 3 true statements:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true (because 3 is prime).\n- Statement 7 is true (because 4 is composite).\n\nThis gives us 3 true statements (1, 6, 7) and 4 false statements (2, 3, 4, 5), which matches our condition.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nWe have 7 statements regarding the truthfulness of the statements themselves. We need to analyze each statement and determine its implications on the number of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.' If true, then there are 3 or more true statements. If false, then there are fewer than 3 true statements, meaning 2 or fewer true statements.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies all 7 statements are true because there are no false statements. If true, then all statements must be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' If true, then 4 statements are true, and 3 are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 4 statements are true. If true, then 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that 4 statements are true, they are essentially saying the same thing, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false if we consider their implications. Thus, Statement 5 being true implies a contradiction because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true or false simultaneously in a way that satisfies Statement 5's condition due to their equivalent implications.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime means it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 since these are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7 (0 is not considered composite, and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the implications of Statement 2 being true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then all 7 statements are true. However, this creates a contradiction with Statement 5 because if all statements are true, then both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, which contradicts Statement 5. Thus, Statement 2 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 10: Assess the truthfulness based on the number of true statements\nLet's examine possible scenarios based on the number of true statements and check for consistency across all statements.\n\n## Step 11: Check for consistency with the number of true statements\n- If all 7 statements are true (as Statement 2 suggests), it's not possible due to the contradiction with Statement 5.\n- For 6 true statements, Statement 2 is false, and Statement 1 is true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 is true because one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is not true (both are false), Statement 6 is true (6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (1 is not composite, so this scenario doesn't fit). This scenario is not valid.\n- For 5 true statements, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite). This is a potential scenario.\n- For 4 true statements, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both are true), Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (3 is not composite). This scenario is not valid because Statement 5 is false, and both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n- For 3 true statements, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (4 is composite). This is a potential scenario.\n- For 2 true statements, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (2 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (5 is not composite). This scenario is not valid.\n- For 1 true statement, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, and it leads to inconsistencies with the other statements.\n- For 0 true statements, Statement 1 is false, and it's not possible for all statements to be false because Statement 1 being false implies there are not at least 3 true statements, which is consistent, but other statements will be false, making it a potential scenario to check.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed check of potential scenarios\nLet's check the scenarios where the number of true statements could be consistent across the statements.\n\n## Step 13: Checking the scenario with 5 true statements\nFor 5 true statements: Statements 1, 5, 6 are true. Statement 2 is false. Statements 3 and 4 are false. Statement 7 is false. So, true statements are 1, 5, 6, and two more need to be true. This could potentially be Statements 3 and 4 being false, which fits if we consider other statements. However, we've already established Statement 7 is false, and we need one more true statement. This scenario requires careful examination but is not straightforward due to the constraints.\n\n## Step 14: Checking the scenario with 3 true statements\nFor 3 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 6 is true. Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 7 are false. This satisfies all conditions: Statement 1 is true because there are 3 true statements, Statement 4 is true because there are 4 false statements, and Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2 and Statement 4\nStatement 2 implies that at least 5 statements are true because there are 7 statements in total and at most 2 can be false. Statement 4 says exactly 6 statements are false, which means only 1 is true. These two statements cannot both be true because they imply different numbers of true statements.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify Statement 2\nIf Statement 2 is true, then at most 2 statements are false, meaning at least 5 statements are true. This directly supports Statement 1 being true because if at least 5 statements are true, then at least 4 are true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the implications of Statement 2 being true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then we have at least 5 true statements. Let's check the other statements. Statement 3 (Exactly 5 true) and Statement 4 (Exactly 1 true) cannot both be true. Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Statement 5\nStatement 5 being true means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. If Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), and Statement 2 is true (at least 5 true statements), it fits. If Statement 4 is true (1 true statement), it contradicts Statement 2. So, if Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 could be true, making Statement 4 false, and thus Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 6: Check the truthfulness of Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 when Statement 2 and Statement 3 are true\nIf Statement 2 and Statement 3 are true, then exactly 5 statements are true. Statement 1 is true because 5 is at least 4. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is prime; 5 is prime, so Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite; there are 2 false statements, and 2 is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the scenario where Statement 2 and Statement 3 are true\nWith Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 1, Statement 5, and Statement 6 being true, we have 5 true statements. This makes Statement 4 and Statement 7 false. So, we have a valid scenario: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true, and Statement 4 and Statement 7 are false.\n\n## Step 8: Check if there are other possible combinations\nLet's directly analyze the statements for other potential truths. If Statement 4 is true, then only 1 statement is true. This would mean Statement 1 is false because it says at least 4 are true. However, if Statement 4 is the only true statement, then Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false (because more than 2 are false), Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is false (because it's about Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true but not both, and here only Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 is false (1 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (6 is composite). This gives us 2 true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 7), which contradicts our initial assumption that only Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the prime and composite conditions\nFor a number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6), it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7. For the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), it means the number of false statements should be 4, 6 (since 4 and 6 are composite numbers less than or equal to 7).\n\n## Step 10: Summarize possible true statement counts based on given conditions\n- If 5 statements are true (as seen with Statement 2 and Statement 3 being true), it satisfies several conditions.\n- Checking for other primes: If 2 statements are true, Statement 7 is true (5 false statements is not composite, it's prime), so this doesn't work because 5 is prime, not composite.\n- If 3 statements are true, Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite, and this could be a potential scenario.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the case where exactly 3 statements are true\nLet's see if having exactly 3 true statements can satisfy the given conditions. Statement 7 would be true because 4 (the number of false statements) is composite. Statement 6 would be true because 3 is prime. So, we need to find 3 statements that can be true. Statement 1 is false because it says at least 4 are true. Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 5 are true. Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 1 is true. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is true. We need one more true statement.\n\n## Step 12: Check for validity of having 3 true statements\nIf Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both are false, Statement 5 is false. So, we have Statement 6 and Statement 7 as true. Statement 2 is false because it says at most 2 are false. We need one more true statement. Statement 1 is false. Let's consider Statement 5 being the third true statement. If Statement 5 is true, and Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, it fits.

For Statement 4 to be true and Statement 5 to be false, we need to check the validity. If Statement 4 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are false. Let's check: Statement 1 is false because not at least 4 are true. Statement 2 is false because more than 2 are false. Statement 3 is false because not exactly 5 are true. Statement 5 is false because it says either Statement 3 or 4 is true but not both, and since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, it actually holds true under the condition that Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, which is a contradiction. Statement 6 is false because 1 is not considered a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 6 is a composite number. So, Statement 4 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 4 being true.\nGiven the analysis, if Statement 4 is true, it leads to a contradiction because Statement 5 would be true (since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, making \"either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\" true), which contradicts our initial assumption that Statement 5 is false when Statement 4 is true. Thus, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the implications of Statement 4 being false.\nSince Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 being true implies that Statement 3 must be true because Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, exactly 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Check if exactly 5 true statements satisfy all conditions.\nIf exactly 5 statements are true, then Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are true, and Statements 4 and 7 are false. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because at least 4 are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 are false. Statement 3 is true because exactly 5 are true. Statement 4 is false, which is consistent. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not a composite number.\n\n## Step 6: Verify the consistency of the statements with exactly 5 true statements.\nWith Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 being true, and Statements 4 and 7 being false, all conditions are met: Statement 1 is satisfied (5 true statements), Statement 2 is satisfied (2 false statements), Statement 3 is satisfied (exactly 5 true), Statement 5 is satisfied (Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false), and Statement 6 is satisfied (5 is prime). This configuration is consistent.\n\n## Step 7: Check for other possible configurations.\nLet's examine other possibilities based on the number of true statements and check if they satisfy all given statements.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the case where Statement 3 is false.\nIf Statement 3 is false, then Statement 5 being true implies Statement 4 is true, which we've established leads to a contradiction.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the prime number condition (Statement 6) and its implications.\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the number of true statements based on prime numbers.\n- If 2 statements are true, Statement 1 is false, which is plausible, but we need to check other statements.\n- If 3 statements are true, Statement 1 is false.\n- If 5 statements are true, it satisfies Statement 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 as seen before.\n- If 7 statements are true, Statement 4 is false (which is consistent), but Statement 7 would be true, claiming 0 false statements are composite, which is true because 0 is not considered composite.\n\n## Step 11: Check the configuration where 7 statements are true.\nIf all 7 statements are true, then: Statement 1 is true (at least 4 true), Statement 2 is true (at most 2 false), Statement 3 is false (not exactly 5 true), Statement 4 is false (not exactly 6 false), Statement 5 is false (both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (7 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (0 is not composite). This configuration fails because Statements 3 and 5 are false.\n\n## Step 12: Assess the validity of other prime configurations.\nFor 2 true statements: Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 are false, and Statements 4, 7 could potentially be true or false. But if Statement 4 is true, it's the only true statement, making Statement 7 false (since 6 is composite), which doesn't fit. For 3 true statements, it's challenging to satisfy all conditions because Statement 1 would be false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze each statement: Statement 1 claims at least 4 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 claims at most 2 of the 7 statements are false, which implies at least 5 are true. Statement 3 claims exactly 5 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 4 claims exactly 6 of the 7 statements are false, meaning exactly 1 is true. Statement 5 claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 4 and its implications.\nStatement 4 says exactly 6 of the 7 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then it must be the only true statement because it claims 6 statements are false. This means all other statements, including Statement 3, are false. However, if Statement 4 is true and the only true statement, then Statement 5 (which states either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both) would be true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, creating a contradiction since Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 4 is the only true statement.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 4 based on the analysis.\nGiven the contradiction found in Step 2 when assuming Statement 4 is true, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the implications of Statement 4 being false on Statement 5.\nSince Statement 4 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true because Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, if Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 being true satisfies Statement 5.\n\n## Step 5: Examine Statement 3 being true and its implications.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true. This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6 must be the true statements because Statement 3 is true. Let's check if this satisfies all conditions: Statement 1 is true because at least 4 statements are true (5 are true). Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false (2 are false). Statement 5 is true as shown in Step 4. Statement 6 needs to be checked for being true; since 5 is a prime number, it is true.\n\n## Step 6: Check the consistency of the statements when Statement 3 is true.\nWith Statement 3 being true, we have 5 true statements. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6 true. Statement 4 is false as established. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is composite. Since there are 2 false statements (Statement 4 and Statement 7), and 2 is a prime number, not composite, Statement 7 is false. This configuration is consistent with our initial assumption that Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Verify if the number of true and false statements satisfies all true statements.\nWe have 5 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6) and 2 false statements (Statement 4, Statement 7). Statement 1 is satisfied (at least 4 true). Statement 2 is satisfied (at most 2 false). Statement 3 is satisfied (exactly 5 true). Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is prime.\n\n## Step 8: Check for other possible configurations.\nLet's consider other possibilities based on the number of true statements. If Statement 3 is false, then the number of true statements is not 5. We need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2 for possible ranges of true statements.\nStatement 1 allows for 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements. Statement 2 allows for 5, 6, or 7 true statements. The overlap is 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Check the case for 6 or 7 true statements.\nFor 6 true statements, Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) would be false because 6 is not prime. For 7 true statements, Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) would be false because 0 is not considered composite. Let's examine if 6 or 7 true statements can satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the scenario with 7 true statements.\nIf 7 statements are true, then Statement 4 being true creates a contradiction because it says exactly 6 are false. Thus, having 7 true statements is not possible because Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the scenario with 6 true statements.\nIf 6 statements are true, then Statement 4 must be false. Statement 6 being true (since 6 is not prime, this is actually false) creates a problem. So, having 6 true statements is not valid because it makes Statement 6 false, and we need 6 statements to be true.\n\n## Step 13: Assess the validity of having exactly 4 true statements.\nIf exactly 4 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 would be false because it says at most 2 are false (meaning at least 5 are true). Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. We need to check other statements. Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) is true because 3 is not composite, it's actually true that 3 is not composite, so this statement is false. Let's see if we can have a configuration where exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 14: Summarize findings.\nWe've established one valid configuration where Statement 3 is true, and exactly 5 statements are true. Let's count the number of possible solutions based on our analysis.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",
