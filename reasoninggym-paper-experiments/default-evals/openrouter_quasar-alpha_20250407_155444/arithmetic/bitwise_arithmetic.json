Since integers are signed, check if it's negative.\n- 0xfc9c in 16 bits is 0b1111110010011100. The highest bit is 1, so it's negative.\n- To find its decimal value, calculate two's complement:\n  - Invert bits: 0b0000001101100011 (0x0363)\n  - Add 1: 0x0363 + 1 = 0x0364 = 868\n  - So, 0xfc9c represents -868 in decimal.\n\nStep 2: 0x28a0\n- 0x28a0 is positive.\n- Convert to decimal: 2*16^3 + 8*16^2 + 10*16 + 0 = 2*4096 + 8*256 + 10*16 + 0 = 8192 + 2048 + 160 + 0 = 10400\n\nStep 3: Multiply the two decimal values:\n- (-868) * 10400 = -9027200\n\nStep 4: Right shift this product by 1 (equivalent to integer division by 2).\n- -9027200 >> 1 = floor(-9027200 / 2) = floor(-4513600) = -4513600\n\nStep 5: Convert the result to hexadecimal.\n- Find hex of 4513600:\n  - 4513600 / 16^5 = 4513600 / 1048576 \u2248 4.3, so the first digit is 4.\n  - 4513600 - 4*1048576 = 4513600 - 4194304 = 319296\n  - 319296 / 65536 \u2248 4.87, next digit 4.\n  - 319296 - 4*65536 = 319296 - 262144 = 57152\n  - 57152 / 4096 \u2248 13.95, next digit D.\n  - 57152 - 13*4096 = 57152 - 53248 = 3904\n  - 3904 / 256 \u2248 15.25, next digit F.\n  - 3904 - 15*256 = 3904 - 3840 = 64\n  - 64 / 16 = 4, no remainder.\n  - 64 - 4*16 = 0, done.\n\nSo, the hex digits are 4, 4, D, F, 4\nResult: 0x44DF40\n\nSince the original result was negative, the answer is:\n-0x44df40\n\n<answer>-0x44df40</answer>",
