So, first Friday = April 22, 2022.\n\nStep 2: Find the last Friday on or before June 18, 2022.  \nJune 18, 2022 is Saturday, so the previous day, June 17, 2022, is Friday. So, last Friday = June 17, 2022.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of Fridays from April 22 to June 17, inclusive.  \nEach Friday is 7 days apart, so count the weeks between these two Fridays.\n\nCalculate the difference in days:  \nJune 17, 2022 - April 22, 2022.\n\nStep 4: Break down the months:  \nFrom April 22 to May 22 = 30 days (since April 22 to May 22 is one month)  \nFrom May 22 to June 17:\n\nMay has 31 days, so from May 22 to May 31 = 9 days  \nJune 1 to June 17 = 17 days  \nTotal from May 22 to June 17 = 9 + 17 = 26 days\n\nTotal days from April 22 to June 17 = 30 + 26 = 56 days.\n\nStep 5: Number of Fridays = (difference in days) / 7 + 1 (since inclusive)  \n56 / 7 = 8 weeks exactly.\n\nThus, number of Fridays = 8 + 1 = 9? No, wait, this is a common mistake. Since the difference is 56 days, which is exactly 8 weeks, the count of Fridays is 8 + 1 only if the period includes both endpoints.\n\nBut since both endpoints are Fridays, and the difference is exactly 8 weeks, the total Fridays are 1 (first Friday) + 7 more, so 8 in total.\n\nAlternatively, count explicitly:  \nFridays fall on:  \nApril 22  \nApril 29  \nMay 6  \nMay 13  \nMay 20  \nMay 27  \nJune 3  \nJune 10  \nJune 17\n\nTotal Fridays = 9.\n\n<answer>9</answer>",
