Given 19 numbers, it resembles a 5x4 grid (since 5x4=20 is close but 19 suggests a missing or non-square shape). Alternatively, perhaps the layout is:\n\n- Example 1 Input: 4 4 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \n- Example 1 Output:4 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe first three numbers seem to be a horizontal line of 4s.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find pattern differences between input and output in examples\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n- Input top row: 4 4 4 0 0\n- Output top row: 4 4 4 0 4\n- Second row input: 4 0 0 0 0\n- Output: 4 4 4 0 0\n- Third row input: 0 4 0 0 0\n- Output: 0 4 4 4 0\n- Last rows: all zeros.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n- Similar expansion of 9s forming a larger block.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n- Input has 5s forming a horizontal line with some verticals.\n- Output shows an expanded block of 5s.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Hypothesize the rule\n\nIn all examples, the output creates a **3x3 block** of the digit (4, 9, or 5) centered roughly where the input had an L-shaped or partial line of that digit.\n\nIn other words, the rule is:\n\n- **Expand the digit(s) in the input into a full 3x3 solid block of that digit, aligned with the top-left of the original digit cluster.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Test the rule on examples\n\n- Example 1: Input has a partial L of 4s, output fills a 3x3 block of 4s.\n- Example 2: Partial L of 9s becomes 3x3 block.\n- Example 3: Partial lines of 5s become 3x3 block.\n\nYes, the outputs are always a **3x3 solid block** of the digit.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Apply the rule to the test input\n\nTest input:\n\n2 2 2 2 2  \n0 0 0 2 0  \n0 0 0 0 0  \n0 0 0 0 0\n\nVisualizing it:\n\nRow1: 2 2 2 2 2  \nRow2: 0 0 0 2 0  \nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0  \nRow4: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nInput has a horizontal line of 2s and a vertical extension down at the right end.\n\nFollowing the rule, the output should be a **3x3 block of 2s** aligned with the top-left of this cluster, i.e., in rows 1-3 and columns 1-3:\n\nRow1: 2 2 2 0 0  \nRow2: 2 2 2 0 0  \nRow3: 2 2 2 0 0  \nRow4: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFlattened as a list (assuming reading rows left to right):\n\n2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n---\n\n### Final output\n\n<answer>2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

In Example 2, the third row in the middle columns became 1's, replacing the 4's. Similarly, in Example 3, the top rows had 6's replaced with 1's.\n\nAnother key is that the 1's **replace the first layer of the nonzero block** within the vertical columns.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Formalize the rule\n\n- For each column:\n  - Find the highest vertical block of contiguous non-zero cells.\n  - Replace the **topmost contiguous segment** of that block with 1s.\n  - Keep the rest of the block unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Apply the rule to the test input\n\nTest Input:\n```\n0 0 0 9 9\n9 9 0 0 9\n9 9 9 9 9\n0 0 0 9 9\n9 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nBreakdown column-wise:\n\n- Column 1:\n  - Values: 0,9,9,0,9\n  - Non-zero blocks:\n    - 9 at row 2-3\n    - 9 at row 5 (isolated)\n  - Top block: rows 2-3\n  - Replace row 2 (top of block) with 1\n  - Result: 0,1,9,0,9\n\n- Column 2:\n  - 0,9,9,0,0\n  - Non-zero block: rows 2-3\n  - Replace row 2 with 1\n  - Result: 0,1,9,0,0\n\n- Column 3:\n  - 0,0,9,0,0\n  - Non-zero block: row 3 only\n  - Replace row 3 with 1\n  - Result: 0,0,1,0,0\n\n- Column 4:\n  - 9,0,9,9,0\n  - Non-zero blocks:\n    - 9 at row 1 (isolated)\n    - 9 at rows 3-4\n  - Top block: row 1\n  - Replace row 1 with 1\n  - Result: 1,0,9,9,0\n\n- Column 5:\n  - 9,9,9,9,0\n  - Non-zero block: rows 1-4\n  - Replace row 1 with 1\n  - Result: 1,9,9,9,0\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Compose the output grid\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 1 1  \nRow 2: 1 1 0 0 9  \nRow 3: 9 9 1 9 9  \nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 9  \nRow 5: 9 0 0 0 0\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid (flattened):\n\n0 0 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 0 9  \n9 9 1 9 9  \n0 0 0 9 9  \n9 0 0 0 0\n\n---\n\n<answer>0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 9 9 1 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

In output, first is 8, second is 2.\n- Next four 2's: connected, adjacent to zeros, all changed to 8's.\n\nSo possibly, **2's touching the border also change to 8's**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Finalize the rule\n\n**Change any connected region of 2's to 8's if it touches a zero or the border of the grid.**\n\nIs this consistent?\n\nExample 1, first row:\n\nAll 2's, touching border, so first four change to 8's, last four stay 2's.\n\nSecond row:\n\n0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nConnected region of 2's adjacent to zero, so all change to 8's except the last one? Output shows last one is 2.\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Apply the rule to the test input\n\nInput:\n\n0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  \n2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0  \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRewrite:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  \nRow 2: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0  \nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nNow, connected regions:\n\n- First row: the first zero adjacent to first 2, so the connected block of 2's starting at position 2 is adjacent to zero, so those 2's change to 8's.\n\nRow 1 output: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n- Second row: first four 2's are adjacent to zeros on the right, so change to 8's.\n- Rest zeros stay zeros.\n\nRow 2 output: 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\n- Third row: zeros remain zeros.\n\nRow 3 output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n---\n\n### Step 12: Final output\n\nFlattened back to single line:\n\n0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe rule:\n\n- For each connected region of 2's, if it is adjacent to a zero or the grid border, change all 2's in that region to 8's.\n- Zeros stay zeros.\n- 2's not adjacent to zeros or grid border stay 2's.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n<answer>0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",
