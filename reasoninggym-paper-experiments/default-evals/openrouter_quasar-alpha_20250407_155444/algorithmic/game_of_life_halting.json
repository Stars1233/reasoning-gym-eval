Since gliders are stable oscillators/space-ships that move forever unless they collide and annihilate, and in this case, they approach each other.\n\nBecause the gliders are on a collision course, they will eventually collide. When two gliders collide, the typical result is mutual annihilation, leaving no live cells. The collision will happen in a few steps.\n\nGiven the small grid (12x12), wrapping, and initial positions, the gliders will collide well before 20 steps, leading to an empty grid.\n\nTherefore, the game will halt before 20 steps.\n\n<answer>True</answer>",
