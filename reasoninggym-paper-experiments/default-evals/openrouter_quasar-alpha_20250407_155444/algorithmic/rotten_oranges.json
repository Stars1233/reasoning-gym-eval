Otherwise, return -1.\n\nLooking at the grid, it contains many zeros (empty cells) that act as barriers, and multiple rotten oranges.\n\nGiven the size (23x23), the initial rotten oranges are scattered well enough to eventually infect all fresh oranges, except possibly those isolated by empty cells.\n\nHowever, there are clear empty cell clusters which isolate some fresh oranges (e.g., in rows 1-2 columns 13-14, and row 6 columns 19-20), meaning some fresh oranges are completely blocked from any rotten influence.\n\nTherefore, there will be unreachable fresh oranges remaining no matter how many minutes pass.\n\nThus, the answer is -1.\n\n<answer>-1</answer>",
