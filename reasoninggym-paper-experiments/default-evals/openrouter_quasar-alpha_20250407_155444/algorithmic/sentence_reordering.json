So the sentence is:  \n\"Then, Mr. ___ said, 'Good-by, for a little while.'\"\n\nBut \"then\" usually comes before \"said,\" as in \"Then Mr. ___ said...\" or after: \"said Mr. ___ then.\"\n\nGiven the original punctuation, the most natural rearrangement is:  \n\"Then, Mr. ___ said, 'Good-by, for a little while.'\"\n\nSince the speaker is \"Mr.\" (name omitted), the restored sentence is:  \n\n<answer>Then, Mr. said, \"Good-by, for a little while.\"</answer>",

Subject: William Cooley\n2. Quote: \"But,\" he continued, \"failing any results from Jupiter, we are again addressing the moon?\"\n3.
