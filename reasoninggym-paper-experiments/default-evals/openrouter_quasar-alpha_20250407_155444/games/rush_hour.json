To move 'F' right, check (5,7) - outside the board, so no. Left? (5,4) is 'I', so no.\n\n'F' is blocked.\n\nAlternative: move 'E', which is vertical at (4,4-5). Above 'E' is 'D', so can't move up.

Now AA can move right to the exit.\n\nDetails:\n\n- J is vertical, currently occupying (1,5), (2,5), (3,5).\n- I is vertical, currently occupying (2,4), (3,4).\n- Both need to be moved up.\n\nStep 1: Move J up by 2 spaces (from rows 1-3 to rows -1 to 1). Since there is no row -1, move J up by 1 space only (occupying rows 0-2). That's enough to clear the third row.\n\n- J-1\n\nStep 2: Move I up by 1 space, so it occupies rows 1-2 instead of 2-3.\n\n- I-1\n\nNow, AA's right side is clear; move AA right by 2 spaces to reach the exit.\n\n- AA+2\n\nFinal sequence: J-1 I-1 AA+2\n\n<answer>J-1 I-1 AA+2</answer>",
