The emoji \ud83d\ude2f is simply a prefix and can be ignored during decoding.\n\nThe variation selectors are Unicode characters in the ranges U+FE00..U+FE0F and U+E0100..U+E01EF, which encode 0-15 and 16-271 respectively.\n\nThe decoding process:\n\n- Extract all variation selectors after the emoji.\n- For each, convert to an integer using the provided function, which maps to a nibble (4 bits).\n- Collect these nibbles in order, pair them as bytes (two nibbles per byte).\n- Convert bytes to a UTF-8 string.\n\nGiven the code, this is what the function does.\n\nSince the problem provides the encoded string and the code, I can simulate the decoding process.\n\nRunning the code on the given string (after \ud83d\ude2f) would produce the decoded sentence.\n\nThe decoded message is:\n\n\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!\"\n\nHence,\n\n<answer>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!</answer>",
