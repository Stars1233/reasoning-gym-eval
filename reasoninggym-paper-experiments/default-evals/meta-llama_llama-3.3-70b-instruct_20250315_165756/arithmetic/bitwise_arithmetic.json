The operations inside the parentheses are subtraction and multiplication.\n\n1. First, solve the subtraction inside the parentheses: \n0xb24a - 0x7a21.\n\n2. Convert these numbers to decimal to make the operations straightforward:\n- 0xb24a in decimal is 45370.\n- 0x7a21 in decimal is 31393.\n\n3. Perform the subtraction: \n45370 - 31393 = 13977.\n\n4. Convert the result back to hexadecimal for consistency with the question:\n13977 in hexadecimal is 0x3699.\n\n5. Next, solve the multiplication inside the other set of parentheses: \n0x16ce * 0x8ada.\n\n6. Again, convert these numbers to decimal:\n- 0x16ce in decimal is 5854.\n- 0x8ada in decimal is 22746.\n\n7. Perform the multiplication:\n5854 * 22746 = 133191884.\n\n8. Convert this result back to hexadecimal:\n133191884 in hexadecimal is 0x7e14c84.\n\n9. Now, multiply the results of the two operations:\n0x3699 * 0x7e14c84.\n\n10. To keep it straightforward, convert these numbers to decimal:\n- 0x3699 in decimal is 13977.\n- 0x7e14c84 in decimal is 133191884.\n\n11. Perform the multiplication:\n13977 * 133191884 = 1862347056588.\n\n12. Convert this result to hexadecimal:\n1862347056588 in hexadecimal is 0x6b7c8a6c84.\n\nHowever, considering the instruction for the answer format, we should directly calculate without converting to decimal for simplicity and accuracy in handling large numbers, but given the steps are conceptually clearer in decimal for most readers, the calculation directly in hexadecimal is less straightforward without computational tools. The calculation directly follows the order of operations as described.\n\nGiven the complexity and the requirement for a precise hexadecimal answer without showing the conversion steps for the final multiplication in decimal, the direct calculation yields:\n\n<answer>-0x6b7c8a6c84</answer>",

Calculate the multiplication inside the first parentheses: `0x7cfb * 0xa9e9`\n2. Calculate the addition inside the second parentheses: `0x144f + 0xa9cf`\n3. Multiply the results of step 1 and step 2.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. `0x7cfb * 0xa9e9`:\n   - `0x7cfb` in decimal is `7 * 16^2 + 12 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0 = 1792 + 192 + 11 = 1995`\n   - `0xa9e9` in decimal is `10 * 16^3 + 9 * 16^2 + 14 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0 = 16384 + 2304 + 224 + 9 = 18921`\n   - `1995 * 18921 = 37768995` in decimal, which is `0x23f3bb7f` in hexadecimal.\n\n2. `0x144f + 0xa9cf`:\n   - `0x144f` in decimal is `1 * 16^2 + 4 * 16^1 + 15 * 16^0 = 16 + 64 + 15 = 95`\n   - `0xa9cf` in decimal is `10 * 16^2 + 9 * 16^1 + 12 * 16^0 = 160 + 144 + 12 = 316`\n   - `95 + 316 = 411` in decimal, which is `0x19b` in hexadecimal.\n\n3. Now, multiply the results of step 1 and step 2:\n   - `0x23f3bb7f * 0x19b`:\n     - `0x23f3bb7f` in decimal is `37768995`\n     - `0x19b` in decimal is `411`\n     - `37768995 * 411 = 15514211005` in decimal.\n\nTo convert `15514211005` to hexadecimal:\n- Divide the number by 16 repeatedly and note the remainders.\n- `15514211005 / 16 = 969512562` remainder `13` (which is `d` in hex)\n- `969512562 / 16 = 60569535` remainder `2`\n- `60569535 / 16 = 3786719` remainder `11` (which is `b` in hex)\n- `3786719 / 16 = 236671` remainder `3`\n- `236671 / 16 = 14791` remainder `15` (which is `f` in hex)\n- `14791 / 16 = 923` remainder `15` (which is `f` in hex)\n- `923 / 16 = 57` remainder `11` (which is `b` in hex)\n- `57 / 16 = 3` remainder `9`\n- `3 / 16 = 0` remainder `3`\n\nSo, writing the remainders from bottom to top gives us the hexadecimal representation: `0x3bf3fb2d`.\n\n<answer>0x3bf3fb2d</answer>",
