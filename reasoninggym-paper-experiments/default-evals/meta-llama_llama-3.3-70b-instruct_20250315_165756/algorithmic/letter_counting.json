Upon reviewing, \"does\" and \"terms\" do not have a \"g\" but \"ag\" in \"agree\" is the primary focus. There is no other \"g\" outside of \"agree\".\n\nGiven the task to count the \"g\"s, we find \"g\" appears once in \"agree\" and also consider \"og\" in \"dog\" is not present, but there is no other \"g\" in the sentence apart from \"agree\".

The word \"agree\" contains 1 \"g\".\n\nHowever, we also need to consider if \"g\" appears in any other words. Upon reviewing, \"does\" and \"terms\" do not have a \"g\" but \"ag\" in \"agree\" is the primary focus. There is no other \"g\" outside of \"agree\".\n\nGiven the task to count the \"g\"s, we find \"g\" appears once in \"agree\" and also consider \"og\" in \"dog\" is not present, but there is no other \"g\" in the sentence apart from \"agree\". Hence, the total count of \"g\" is the number of times \"g\" appears in the word \"agree\" which is once, and there's an additional \"g\" in \"dog\" which is not present, so only one \"g\" from \"agree\".\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",
