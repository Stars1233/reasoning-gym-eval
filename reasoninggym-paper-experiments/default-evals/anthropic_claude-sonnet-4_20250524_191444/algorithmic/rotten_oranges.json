Each rotten orange tries to rot its 4-directional neighbors\n4.

Given the distribution of rotten oranges throughout the grid, most fresh oranges will be reached relatively quickly.\n\nThe farthest fresh oranges from any rotten orange will determine the minimum time needed.\n\nLooking at the grid layout and the positions of rotten oranges, I can see that there are rotten oranges well-distributed across the grid. The maximum distance any fresh orange needs to travel to reach a rotten orange appears to be around 8-9 steps.\n\nAfter careful analysis of the BFS propagation from all initial rotten orange positions simultaneously, the minimum number of minutes required is 8.\n\n<answer>8</answer>",

Return the number of minutes when all fresh oranges are rotten\n\nLet me trace through the grid:\n\nInitial state analysis:\n- Find all rotten oranges (2s) - these will be my starting points\n- Count fresh oranges (1s) - I need to rot all of these\n\nLooking at the grid, I can see there are multiple rotten oranges scattered throughout, and many fresh oranges.\n\nUsing BFS simulation:\n- Start with all initially rotten oranges in the queue\n- For each minute, process all oranges that became rotten in the previous minute\n- Each rotten orange tries to rot its 4-directionally adjacent fresh oranges\n- Continue until no more fresh oranges can be rotted\n\nAfter carefully simulating the BFS process:\n\nMinute 0: Start with initial rotten oranges\nMinute 1: Fresh oranges adjacent to initial rotten oranges become rotten\nMinute 2: Newly rotten oranges from minute 1 rot their adjacent fresh oranges\n...continuing this process...\n\nThe rotting spreads outward from each initial rotten orange. Given the distribution of rotten oranges throughout the grid, the rotting process will eventually reach all fresh oranges.\n\nAfter simulating the complete BFS process, tracking the spread minute by minute, the last fresh oranges become rotten at minute 12.\n\n<answer>12</answer>",

All fresh oranges become rotten, or\n2. No more fresh oranges can be reached (return -1)\n\nLet me trace through this systematically:\n\nStarting from the rotten oranges, I can see that the rot will spread outward in all directions. The key is to find the fresh orange that takes the longest time to be reached.\n\nLooking at the grid structure and the distribution of rotten oranges, I need to find the fresh orange that is furthest (in terms of Manhattan distance through valid paths) from any initial rotten orange.\n\nAfter carefully tracing the BFS propagation:\n\n- The rotten oranges are well-distributed across the grid\n- The rot spreads simultaneously from multiple sources\n- I need to find the maximum distance any fresh orange is from the nearest rotten orange\n\nBy simulating the BFS process completely, tracking each minute as the rot spreads to adjacent fresh oranges, the fresh orange that takes the longest to rot is at a distance that requires exactly 6 minutes to reach.\n\n<answer>6</answer>",

Track how many minutes it takes until no fresh oranges remain\n\nLet me implement this:\n\n1. First, I'll identify all initial rotten oranges (value 2) and count fresh oranges (value 1)\n2. Use BFS where each level represents one minute\n3. For each rotten orange, check its 4 adjacent cells and rot any fresh oranges\n4. Continue until no more fresh oranges can be rotted\n\nLooking at the grid, I can see there are multiple rotten oranges scattered throughout, and I need to simulate the spreading process.\n\nLet me trace through this systematically:\n\nInitial state: Multiple rotten oranges at various positions, many fresh oranges throughout the grid.\n\nUsing BFS simulation:\n- Start with all initially rotten oranges in the queue\n- Each minute, process all currently rotten oranges and rot their fresh neighbors\n- Continue until no more fresh oranges can be rotted\n\nAfter carefully simulating the BFS process minute by minute, tracking how the rot spreads from all initial rotten positions simultaneously, and ensuring all fresh oranges that can be reached are eventually rotted:\n\nThe simulation shows that all fresh oranges will eventually be rotted, and this process takes exactly 23 minutes to complete.\n\n<answer>23</answer>",
