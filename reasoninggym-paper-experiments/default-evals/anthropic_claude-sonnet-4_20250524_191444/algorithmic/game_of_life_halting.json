Continuing this process, the sparse pattern will continue to lose cells as most don't have enough neighbors to survive.\n\nGiven the very sparse initial configuration with mostly isolated cells, the pattern will quickly die out within a few steps as cells don't have sufficient neighbors to maintain life.\n\n<answer>True</answer>",

Let me check each live cell:\n- Center cell (6,6): has 4 neighbors \u2192 dies\n- Top cell (5,6): has 3 neighbors \u2192 survives  \n- Bottom cell (7,6): has 3 neighbors \u2192 survives\n- Left cell (6,5): has 3 neighbors \u2192 survives\n- Right cell (6,7): has 3 neighbors \u2192 survives\n\nThe cells at the corners of the cross each have 2 neighbors, so they become alive.\n\n```\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n.....111...\n.....1.1...\n.....111...\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n```\n\nStep 3:\nThis creates a 3x3 block pattern. In Conway's Game of Life, a 2x2 block is stable, but larger blocks behave differently. Let me check the 3x3 pattern:\n\nEach corner cell has 3 neighbors \u2192 survives\nEach edge cell has 5 neighbors \u2192 dies\nCenter cell has 8 neighbors \u2192 dies\n\n```\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n.....1.1...\n...........\n.....1.1...\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n```\n\nStep 4:\nNow I have four cells in a 2x2 pattern. Each cell has exactly 3 neighbors, so they all survive, and no new cells are born.\n\n```\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n.....11....\n.....11....\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n```\n\nThis is a stable 2x2 block pattern. It will remain unchanged indefinitely.\n\nSince the pattern stabilizes into a 2x2 block and never becomes empty, the game will not halt.\n\n<answer>False</answer>",

Only a few cells might survive or be born where there are local clusters.\n\nStep 2: The remaining cells (if any) would be even more isolated.\n\nGiven the sparse, diagonal pattern of the initial configuration with no dense clusters, each live cell has very few neighbors (most have 0-1 neighbors). This means:\n- Almost all cells will die in step 1 due to underpopulation\n- No new cells will be born because there aren't enough adjacent live cells to create the required 3 neighbors\n- Any remaining cells will be even more isolated and will die in subsequent steps\n\nThe pattern will quickly collapse to an empty grid within the first few steps.\n\n<answer>True</answer>",
