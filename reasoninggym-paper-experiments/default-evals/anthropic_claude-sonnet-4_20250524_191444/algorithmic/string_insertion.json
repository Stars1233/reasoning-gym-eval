If there is a substring ABCD in the string, insert the character A after the substring.\n2. If there is a substring BCDE in the string, insert the character B after the substring.\n3. If there is a substring CDEA in the string, insert the character C after the substring.\n4. If there is a substring DEAB in the string, insert the character D after the substring.\n5. If there is a substring EABC in the string, insert the character E after the substring.\n\nOnce you have inserted a character, you have to skip over the substring and the inserted character and continue the search from the next character.\n\nYour output should be a string that has been modified according to the pattern.\n\nGiven the following string, provide the answer after inserting the characters according to the pattern: ACCDADCCDE\n",
