Let me determine what day of the week May 26, 2022 was:\nMay 26, 2022 was a Thursday.\n\nSince we have exactly 100 days total, this spans 14 complete weeks plus 2 extra days (100 = 14 \u00d7 7 + 2).\n\nIn 14 complete weeks, there are 14 \u00d7 5 = 70 business days.\n\nNow I need to check the remaining 2 days:\n- Starting from Thursday, May 26\n- The 99th day would be Tuesday, August 30 (since 98 = 14 \u00d7 7)\n- The 100th day would be Wednesday, August 31\n- But we're going to September 2, which would be Friday\n\nLet me recalculate more carefully:\nMay 26 (Thursday) is day 1\nMay 27 (Friday) is day 2\n...continuing this pattern...\n\nActually, let me use a more systematic approach. From Thursday, May 26 to Friday, September 2:\n\nMay 26 (Thu) to June 2 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nJune 3 (Fri) to June 9 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days  \nJune 10 (Fri) to June 16 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nJune 17 (Fri) to June 23 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nJune 24 (Fri) to June 30 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\n\nJuly 1 (Fri) to July 7 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nJuly 8 (Fri) to July 14 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nJuly 15 (Fri) to July 21 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nJuly 22 (Fri) to July 28 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nJuly 29 (Fri) to August 4 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\n\nAugust 5 (Fri) to August 11 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nAugust 12 (Fri) to August 18 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nAugust 19 (Fri) to August 25 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nAugust 26 (Fri) to September 1 (Thu): 1 week = 5 business days\nSeptember 2 (Fri): 1 business day\n\nThat's 14 complete weeks \u00d7 5 business days + 1 additional business day = 70 + 1 = 71 business days.\n\n<answer>71</answer>",
