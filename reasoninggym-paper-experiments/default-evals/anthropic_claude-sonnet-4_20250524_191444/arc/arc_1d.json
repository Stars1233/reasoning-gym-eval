Looking more carefully:\n\nIn each example, I can identify contiguous sequences of 2s separated by 0s. Within each sequence of consecutive 2s, a certain number of 2s from the left are changed to 8s.\n\nLet me count the lengths of consecutive 2 sequences:\n\nExample 1: \n- First sequence: 5 consecutive 2s \u2192 first 2 become 8s\n- Second sequence: 5 consecutive 2s \u2192 first 3 become 8s\n\nExample 2:\n- First sequence: 3 consecutive 2s \u2192 first 1 becomes 8\n- Second sequence: 5 consecutive 2s \u2192 first 2 become 8s\n\nExample 3:\n- First sequence: 3 consecutive 2s \u2192 first 1 becomes 8\n- Second sequence: 6 consecutive 2s \u2192 first 3 become 8s\n\nI notice a pattern: For a sequence of n consecutive 2s, the number of 2s that become 8s appears to be floor(n/2) + (n%2 if it's not the first sequence).\n\nLet me verify this pattern more carefully:\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. Let me check if it's related to the position or length:\n\nExample 1: 5\u21922, 5\u21923\nExample 2: 3\u21921, 5\u21922  \nExample 3: 3\u21921, 6\u21923\n\nIt seems like for each contiguous group of 2s:\n- If the length is odd: convert (length+1)/2 to 8s\n- If the length is even: convert length/2 to 8s\n\nWait, let me check this:\nExample 1: length 5 (odd) \u2192 (5+1)/2 = 3, but only 2 are converted in first group\nExample 2: length 3 (odd) \u2192 (3+1)/2 = 2, but only 1 is converted\n\nLet me try a simpler pattern: convert floor(length/2) + 1 for odd lengths, floor(length/2) for even lengths?\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- Length 3 \u2192 1 conversion\n- Length 5 \u2192 2 or 3 conversions  \n- Length 6 \u2192 3 conversions\n\nThe pattern seems to be: convert floor((length+1)/2) 2s to 8s from the left of each contiguous sequence.\n\nLet me verify:\n- Length 3: floor((3+1)/2) = 2, but only 1 is converted\n- Length 5: floor((5+1)/2) = 3, and we see 2 or 3 conversions\n- Length 6: floor((6+1)/2) = 3, and we see 3 conversions\n\nActually, let me try: convert floor(length/2) + (1 if length is odd) = ceiling(length/2)\n\n- Length 3: ceiling(3/2) = 2, but only 1 converted\n- Length 5: ceiling(5/2) = 3, we see 2 or 3\n- Length 6: ceiling(6/2) = 3, we see 3\n\nThe pattern appears to be: for each contiguous sequence of 2s, convert the first ceiling(length/2) of them to 8s.\n\nBut this doesn't match perfectly. Let me look at the actual conversions again:\n\nLooking at the sequences and their conversions:\n- 3 consecutive 2s \u2192 1 becomes 8\n- 5 consecutive 2s \u2192 2 becomes 8 (first occurrence) or 3 becomes 8 (second occurrence)\n- 6 consecutive 2s \u2192 3 becomes 8\n\nWait, I think the rule might be simpler: convert floor(length/2) + 1 for the first sequence, and ceiling(length/2) for subsequent sequences.\n\nActually, let me try: convert ceiling(length/2) 2s to 8s, but with some position-dependent variation.\n\nGiven the complexity, let me try the most consistent pattern I see: for each contiguous group of 2s of length n, convert the first ceiling(n/2) 2s to 8s.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\nInput: 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nI identify two groups:\n- First group: 5 consecutive 2s \u2192 convert ceiling(5/2) = 3 to 8s\n- Second group: 3 consecutive 2s \u2192 convert ceiling(3/2) = 2 to 8s\n\n<answer>8 8 8 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

It seems like the non-zero sequence is being shifted left by a certain number of positions, but with some rotation involved.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In all examples, there's a contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers\n- This sequence appears to be shifted left by some amount\n- The shift amount seems to be 4 positions in Examples 2 and 3\n- In Example 1, it's more complex - the sequence is shifted and the first element wraps around\n\nLet me try a different approach. Looking at the pattern:\n- Find the contiguous non-zero sequence\n- Shift it left by 4 positions\n- If shifting would cause elements to go beyond the left boundary, they wrap around to the right end\n\nWait, let me re-examine Example 1 more carefully:\nInput sequence of non-zeros: 9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 (starting at position 3)\nOutput: This sequence appears at position 0, but the first element (9) has moved to the end.\n\nActually, I think the rule is:\n1. Identify the contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers\n2. Rotate this sequence left by 1 position (first element goes to the end)\n3. Shift the entire rotated sequence left by 3 positions\n\nLet me verify this with all examples:\n\nExample 1: \n- Non-zero sequence: 9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4\n- Rotate left by 1: 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 9\n- Shift left by 3: starts at position 0 instead of 3\n- This matches the output!\n\nLet me check Examples 2 and 3 with this rule... Actually, this doesn't seem right for those.\n\nLet me try once more with a simpler observation:\nThe rule appears to be: shift the entire non-zero sequence left by exactly 4 positions, and if the first element would go off the left edge, it wraps to the right end.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7\n\nThe non-zero sequence is: 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7 (starting at position 11)\nShifting left by 4 positions: it should start at position 7\nSince no elements go off the left edge, no wrapping is needed.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7 0 0 0 0</answer>",

The output moves this 0 to position 4, keeping the rest as 6s.\n\nExample 3: All positions are 1s in both input and output - no change needed.\n\nLooking more carefully at the pattern:\n\nIn Example 1: There are 7 zeros in the input (positions 2-8). In the output, there are 4 zeros total (2 at each end).\n\nIn Example 2: There is 1 zero in the input. In the output, there is still 1 zero, but moved to a different position.\n\nLet me reconsider the rule. Looking at the positions more carefully:\n\nExample 1: The zeros seem to be redistributed to create symmetry, with some zeros moved to the edges.\n\nExample 2: The single zero is moved from position 8 to position 4.\n\nActually, let me count more systematically:\n\nExample 1: \n- Input has zeros at positions 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (7 zeros)\n- Output has zeros at positions 0,1,22,23 (4 zeros)\n\nThis doesn't seem right.

Maybe the rule is about moving minority elements (the less frequent value) to the edges while keeping the majority element in the center.\n\nIn Example 1: 0 is minority (7 occurrences), 8 is majority (17 occurrences)\nIn Example 2: 0 is minority (1 occurrence), 6 is majority (23 occurrences)  \nIn Example 3: Only 1s present, so no change needed\n\nThe rule appears to be: Move the minority value(s) toward the edges/ends of the array, while concentrating the majority value in the center.\n\nFor the test input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nCounting: 22 zeros, 2 sixes\nThe minority value is 6 (2 occurrences), majority is 0 (22 occurrences)\n\nFollowing the pattern, the 6s should be moved toward the center, and 0s should fill the edges.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

In the output, 0s appear at the beginning (positions 0-4, 5 positions) and end (positions 22-23, 2 positions). Total: 7 positions preserved.\n\nExample 2: One 0 at position 8 becomes one 0 at position 4.\n\nThe rule appears to be: Move minority values (non-dominant values) toward the beginning of the sequence, while preserving the total count of each value.\n\nFor the test input:\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nCounting values:\n- 0s: 22 positions\n- 6s: 2 positions (at positions 17-18)\n\nThe minority values are the two 6s.

The non-zero values fill in the remaining positions\n\nLet me verify this rule:\n\nExample 1: Zeros at positions 4-9 \u2192 shifted to positions 6-11 \u2713\nExample 2: Zeros at positions 5-12 \u2192 shifted to positions 7-14 \u2713  \nExample 3: Zeros at positions 2-10 \u2192 shifted to positions 4-12 \u2713\n\nThe rule is: **Shift the contiguous sequence of zeros 2 positions to the right, and fill the remaining positions with the non-zero value.**\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\nInput: 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\nThe zeros are at positions 7-23 (17 zeros total).\nShifting 2 positions to the right: positions 9-25.\nBut the grid only has 24 positions, so the zeros will be at positions 9-24 (16 zeros), and the last zero will extend beyond the grid.\n\nWait, let me recount more carefully:\nInput positions: 1-24\nZeros are at positions: 7-23 (that's 17 zeros)\nShifting right by 2: positions 9-25\nSince position 25 doesn't exist, the zeros occupy positions 9-24 (that's 16 positions)\n\nThe output should be: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

Find the continuous sequence of 0s\n2. Shift this sequence 2 positions to the right\n3. Fill the first 2 positions of the original 0 sequence with the non-zero value that appears in the grid\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\nInput: 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\nThe 0s are at positions 6-22 (17 zeros).\nFollowing the rule:\n- Shift the 0s 2 positions to the right: positions 8-24\n- Fill positions 6-7 with 4s\n- The sequence of 0s maintains its length (17 zeros)\n\n<answer>4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

What if the rule is about moving the non-zero elements in a specific way?\n\nAfter more careful analysis, I think the pattern is:\n1. Find all non-zero elements and their sequence\n2. Rotate this sequence by half its length (or a specific amount)\n3. Place the rotated sequence back, but split across the grid\n\nFor the test input:\nInput: 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero sequence is: [6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7] (length 9)\nIf I rotate by half the length (4-5 positions), or looking at the pattern more carefully...\n\nActually, let me try a different approach. Looking at Example 1 again:\n- The sequence [5, 6, 3, 9] gets split with [3, 9] going to positions 0-1 and [5, 6] going to positions 10-11\n- This suggests taking the last half and putting it at the start, and the first half at the end\n\nFor the test input [6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7]:\n- Length is 9, so split would be first 4: [6, 3, 4, 2] and last 5: [6, 9, 8, 1, 7]\n- But this doesn't seem right given the other examples...\n\nLet me try: rotate the non-zero sequence by 2 positions to the right:\n[6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7] \u2192 [1, 7, 6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8]\n\n<answer>1 7 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 0 0 0</answer>",

Let me check if there's a rotation or circular shift pattern.\n\nLooking again at Example 2:\n- Input: [1, 5, 3] at positions 2, 3, 4\n- Output: [1, 5, 3] at positions 5, 6, 7\n- This is just a shift right by 3 positions\n\nExample 3:\n- Input: [8, 8] at positions 0, 1\n- Output: [8, 8] at positions 3, 4\n- This is also a shift right by 3 positions\n\nBut Example 1 doesn't follow this simple shift pattern...\n\nLet me reconsider Example 1 more carefully:\nInput:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 3 9 0\nOutput: 3 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6\n\nThe non-zero sequence [5, 6, 3, 9] becomes [3, 9] at the start and [5, 6] at the end.\nThis looks like the sequence is rotated by 2 positions to the left: [5, 6, 3, 9] \u2192 [3, 9, 5, 6], then placed with [3, 9] at the beginning and [5, 6] at the end.\n\nWait, let me think about this systematically. What if the rule is about moving the non-zero elements in a specific way?\n\nAfter more careful analysis, I think the pattern is:\n1. Find all non-zero elements and their sequence\n2. Rotate this sequence by half its length (or a specific amount)\n3. Place the rotated sequence back, but split across the grid\n\nFor the test input:\nInput: 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero sequence is: [6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7] (length 9)\nIf I rotate by half the length (4-5 positions), or looking at the pattern more carefully...\n\nActually, let me try a different approach. Looking at Example 1 again:\n- The sequence [5, 6, 3, 9] gets split with [3, 9] going to positions 0-1 and [5, 6] going to positions 10-11\n- This suggests taking the last half and putting it at the start, and the first half at the end\n\nFor the test input [6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7]:\n- Length is 9, so split would be first 4: [6, 3, 4, 2] and last 5: [6, 9, 8, 1, 7]\n- But this doesn't seem right given the other examples...\n\nLet me try: rotate the non-zero sequence by 2 positions to the right:\n[6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7] \u2192 [1, 7, 6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8]\n\n<answer>1 7 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 0 0 0</answer>",

Let me look more carefully:\n\nExample 1: \n- Input has \"5 6 3 9\" \n- Output has \"3 9\" at the beginning and \"5 6\" at the end\n- It appears the sequence is split in half and the second half goes to the beginning, first half goes to the end\n\nExample 2:\n- Input has \"1 5 3\" at positions 2-4\n- Output has \"1 5 3\" at positions 5-7\n- The sequence moved 3 positions to the right\n\nExample 3:\n- Input has \"8 8\" at positions 0-1\n- Output has \"8 8\" at positions 3-4\n- The sequence moved 3 positions to the right\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Looking at the positions more carefully:\n\nExample 1: The non-zero sequence \"5 6 3 9\" gets split - \"3 9\" goes to positions 0-1, \"5 6\" goes to positions 10-11\nExample 2: \"1 5 3\" moves from positions 2-4 to positions 5-7 (shift of +3)\nExample 3: \"8 8\" moves from positions 0-1 to positions 3-4 (shift of +3)\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. Let me check if there's a consistent rule about splitting sequences:\n\nIn Example 1, the 4-element sequence \"5 6 3 9\" is split into two 2-element parts: \"5 6\" and \"3 9\", with \"3 9\" going to the start and \"5 6\" going to the end.\n\nLet me verify this pattern:\n- Find the continuous non-zero sequence\n- If the sequence has even length, split it in half\n- Put the second half at the beginning of the output\n- Put the first half at the end of the output\n- For odd-length sequences or other cases, there might be a different rule\n\nBut Examples 2 and 3 don't follow this splitting pattern. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, let me look at where the sequences end up relative to their original positions:\n\nExample 2: Sequence moves right by 3 positions\nExample 3: Sequence moves right by 3 positions  \nExample 1: This seems different - it's a split and rearrange\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe the rule is about rotating or shifting the non-zero elements:\n\nLooking again at Example 1:\nInput sequence: 5 6 3 9\nOutput: 3 9 (at start) and 5 6 (at end)\nThis looks like the sequence was rotated - the last half became the first half.\n\nFor the test input: 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero sequence is: 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 (9 elements)\n\nIf I follow the pattern from Example 1 (splitting and rearranging), but the sequence has odd length...\n\nLet me try a different approach: maybe the rule is to take the non-zero sequence and place it at a specific position, or rotate it in some way.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the rule is:\n1. Identify the continuous non-zero sequence\n2. Split it roughly in half\n3. Place the second half at the beginning\n4. Place the first half at the end\n\nFor 9 elements: split as 4 and 5, or 5 and 4.\n\nLet me try splitting \"6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7\" as:\nFirst part: \"6 3 4 2 6\" (5 elements)\nSecond part: \"9 8 1 7\" (4 elements)\n\nOutput would be: \"9 8 1 7\" followed by zeros, then \"6 3 4 2 6\"\n\n<answer>9 8 1 7 0 0 0 6 3 4 2 6</answer>",

First, I'll identify the non-zero sequences in each input:\n   - Example 1: \"5 6 3 9\" at positions 7-10\n   - Example 2: \"1 5 3\" at positions 2-4\n   - Example 3: \"8 8\" at positions 0-1\n\n2.

Looking more carefully:\n\nIn Example 1: The sequence \"5 6 3 9\" gets split in half and swapped - \"3 9\" (second half) goes to the beginning, \"5 6\" (first half) goes to the end.\n\nLet me check if there's a simpler pattern about moving sequences:\n\nExample 2: \"1 5 3\" moves from start of non-zero region to middle\nExample 3: \"8 8\" moves from start to middle\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. Let me see if there's a rotation or shift pattern:\n\nLooking at the positions more carefully:\n- Example 1: 4-element sequence gets split and the halves swap positions\n- Example 2: 3-element sequence shifts right by 3 positions  \n- Example 3: 2-element sequence shifts right by 3 positions\n\nI think the rule is: Take the contiguous non-zero sequence and shift it right by 3 positions. If the sequence has 4 or more elements, split it in half and swap the halves.\n\nLet me verify:\n- Example 2: \"1 5 3\" at positions 2-4 \u2192 shifts to positions 5-7 \u2713\n- Example 3: \"8 8\" at positions 0-1 \u2192 shifts to positions 3-4 \u2713\n- Example 1: \"5 6 3 9\" \u2192 split into \"5 6\" and \"3 9\", swap them, then \"3 9\" goes to start and \"5 6\" goes to end \u2713\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\nInput: 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero sequence is: 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 (9 elements)\nSince this has more than 4 elements, I split it in half:\nFirst half: 6 3 4 2 6 (5 elements)\nSecond half: 9 8 1 7 (4 elements)\n\nWait, that's not even. Let me reconsider the rule.\n\nLooking again at Example 1 more carefully:\nInput sequence: 5 6 3 9\nOutput: the sequence is split exactly in half: \"5 6\" and \"3 9\"\nThe second half \"3 9\" goes to the beginning, first half \"5 6\" goes to the end.\n\nFor the test case with 9 elements, I need to determine how to split it.\nLooking at the pattern, it seems like for even-length sequences, we split exactly in half.\nFor odd-length sequences, let me see... but Examples 2 and 3 don't split at all.\n\nLet me reconsider: maybe the rule is different based on sequence length:\n- If sequence length \u2264 3: shift right by 3\n- If sequence length = 4: split in half and swap\n- If sequence length > 4: ?\n\nFor the test input with 9 elements, if I follow the pattern of splitting and swapping:\nSplit 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 into two parts.\nIf I split roughly in half: 6 3 4 2 6 (first 5) and 9 8 1 7 (last 4)\nSwapping: 9 8 1 7 goes first, then 6 3 4 2 6\n\n<answer>9 8 1 7 6 3 4 2 6 0 0 0</answer>",

Extend the original sequence by one element in the direction where the adjacent value was removed from\n\nLet me verify this rule:\n\nExample 1: Sequence of 5s with 4 at the end \u2192 4 moves to front, sequence extends by one 5\nExample 2: 7 at start of sequence of 2s \u2192 7 moves to end, sequence extends by one 2  \nExample 3: Sequence of 5s with 8 at the end \u2192 8 moves to front, sequence extends by one 5\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\nInput: 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nI see a 4 followed by a sequence of eight 3s. Following the pattern:\n- The 4 should move to the end of the sequence of 3s\n- The sequence should extend by adding one more 3 at the beginning\n\n<answer>3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

Identify a sequence consisting of repeated identical values followed by a different value\n2. Move the different value to the beginning of the sequence\n3. Add one more instance of the repeated value at the end of the sequence\n\nLet me verify this pattern:\n\nExample 1: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4] becomes [4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\nExample 2: [7,2,2,2] becomes [2,2,2,7] (this seems different - let me reconsider)\n\nActually, looking more carefully at Example 2:\nThe pattern might be: when there's a different value at the start of a sequence, move it to the end.\nWhen there's a different value at the end of a sequence, move it to the beginning.\n\nLet me re-examine:\nExample 1: Sequence ends with different value (4) \u2192 move to beginning\nExample 2: Sequence starts with different value (7) \u2192 move to end  \nExample 3: Sequence ends with different value (8) \u2192 move to beginning\n\nThis makes more sense. The rule is:\n- If a sequence of identical values has a different value at the end, move that different value to the beginning\n- If a sequence of identical values has a different value at the beginning, move that different value to the end\n- The total length of the sequence remains the same\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\nInput: 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe sequence is [4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3] - it starts with a different value (4), so I move it to the end.\n\n<answer>3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

Keep all other elements (including zeros) in their relative positions\n\nApplying this to the test input:\nInput: 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\nThe first group is \"2 2 2 2 2\" (5 consecutive 2s)\nThere are isolated 2s at positions 9 and 15\nThese should be replaced with \"2 2 2 2 2\"\n\nHowever, I need to be careful about positioning. Looking more closely at the examples, it seems like the replacement happens in place, expanding to fill the available space.\n\nLet me reconsider the pattern more carefully:\n\nIn Example 1: single 4 at position 5 becomes \"4 4 4\" starting at position 4\nIn Example 2: single 9s become \"9 9 9\" groups\nIn Example 3: single 5 becomes \"5 5 5 5 5\"\n\nThe rule seems to be: replace each isolated occurrence of the number with the same pattern as the first group, starting from the position where the isolated number appears.\n\nFor the test input:\n- First group: \"2 2 2 2 2\" (5 twos)\n- Isolated 2 at position 8: replace with \"2 2 2 2 2\" starting at position 8\n- Isolated 2 at position 14: replace with \"2 2 2 2 2\" starting at position 14\n\n<answer>2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2</answer>",

The total length remains constant (29 elements)\n2. The number of non-zero elements (6s) stays the same\n3. The non-zero block appears to shift position\n\nLet me examine the shift pattern more carefully:\n\nExample 1: \n- Input starts at position 4 (0-indexed)\n- Output starts at position 2\n- Shift: -2 positions (left by 2)\n\nExample 2:\n- Input starts at position 2\n- Output starts at position 0\n- Shift: -2 positions (left by 2)\n\nExample 3:\n- Input starts at position 14\n- Output starts at position 13\n- Shift: -1 position (left by 1)\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Let me look at the trailing zeros:\n\nExample 1: Input has 1 trailing zero, output has 3 trailing zeros (+2)\nExample 2: Input has 4 trailing zeros, output has 6 trailing zeros (+2)\nExample 3: Input has 5 trailing zeros, output has 6 trailing zeros (+1)\n\nLet me look at leading zeros:\nExample 1: Input has 4 leading zeros, output has 2 leading zeros (-2)\nExample 2: Input has 2 leading zeros, output has 0 leading zeros (-2)\nExample 3: Input has 14 leading zeros, output has 13 leading zeros (-1)\n\nI see a pattern emerging. Let me check if there's a relationship with the number of leading/trailing zeros:\n\nIn Examples 1 and 2: The leading zeros decrease by 2, and trailing zeros increase by 2.\nIn Example 3: The leading zeros decrease by 1, and trailing zeros increase by 1.\n\nLooking more carefully at Example 3, I notice that if we tried to decrease leading zeros by 2 (from 14 to 12), we'd need to increase trailing zeros by 2 (from 5 to 7), but that would exceed the total length constraint.\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n- Try to shift the non-zero block left by 2 positions (decrease leading zeros by 2, increase trailing zeros by 2)\n- If this would make trailing zeros exceed some limit or violate constraints, shift by only 1 position instead\n\nActually, let me reconsider with a simpler rule: shift the non-zero block left by 2 positions when possible, otherwise by 1 position.\n\nFor the test input:\nInput: 9 zeros, then 8 threes, then 12 zeros\n\nApplying the rule (shift left by 2):\n- Leading zeros: 9 - 2 = 7\n- Trailing zeros: 12 + 2 = 14\n- This gives us: 7 zeros, then 8 threes, then 14 zeros\n- Total: 7 + 8 + 14 = 29 \u2713\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

To the left, there are only zeros. To the right, there's a sequence of \"3\"s from position 11 to 21 (length 11). So \"2\" should become \"3\", and the gap at position 10 should be filled with \"3\".\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0</answer>",

Find the position of \"2\" in the input\n2. Look at the non-zero values on both sides of \"2\"\n3. The \"2\" gets replaced by whichever non-zero value appears in a longer sequence\n4. If there are gaps (zeros) between \"2\" and the longer sequence, those gaps get filled with the same non-zero value\n\nLet me verify this rule:\n- Example 1: \"6\" sequence is length 7, right side has no non-zero sequence. \"2\" becomes \"6\", gap of 1 zero gets filled with \"6\"\n- Example 2: Left side has no non-zero sequence, \"9\" sequence is length 8. \"2\" becomes \"9\", gaps get filled with \"9\"\n- Example 3: \"9\" sequence is length 15, right side has no non-zero sequence. \"2\" becomes \"9\"\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\nThe \"2\" is at position 9. To the left, there are only zeros. To the right, there's a sequence of \"3\"s from position 11 to 21 (length 11). So \"2\" should become \"3\", and the gap at position 10 should be filled with \"3\".\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0</answer>",

In the output, the 2 is replaced with a 6, extending the sequence of 6s.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n- Input:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n- Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\nHere, there's a sequence of 0s, then a 2, then more 0s, then a sequence of 9s.

In the output, the 2 is replaced with a 9, extending the sequence of 9s rightward.\n\nThe pattern appears to be:\n1. Find the position of the number 2 in the input\n2. Look at the non-zero sequences on either side of the 2\n3. Replace the 2 with whichever non-zero value would create a longer continuous sequence\n\nLet me verify this rule:\n- Example 1: 6s on the left, 0s on the right. Replacing 2 with 6 extends the 6 sequence.\n- Example 2: 0s on the left, 9s on the right. Replacing 2 with 9 and filling the gap extends the 9 sequence.\n- Example 3: 9s on the left, 0s on the right. Replacing 2 with 9 extends the 9 sequence.\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\nThe 2 is at position 9 (0-indexed). To the left are 0s, to the right there's a 0 then a sequence of 3s.

Find the position of \"2\" in the input\n2. There are two distinct non-zero sequences (excluding the \"2\") on either side\n3. The \"2\" acts as a barrier that gets replaced by extending one of the adjacent sequences\n4.

Following the rule, I should move one 4 from the beginning to the end, but since all elements are the same, this would result in the same sequence.\n\nWait, let me reconsider.

          "full_model_response": "I need to analyze the given examples to find the pattern that maps input grids to output grids.\n\nLet me examine each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:  0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0\nOutput: 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:  6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:  0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\nOutput: 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet me look for patterns:\n\n1. First, I notice that the output grids seem to end with trailing zeros in all examples.\n\n2. Looking at the non-zero values:\n   - Example 1: Input has 6s and 0s, output has 6s and 0s\n   - Example 2: Input has 6s and 0s, output has 6s and 0s  \n   - Example 3: Input has 1s and 0s, output has 1s and 0s\n\n3. The non-zero digit in the input becomes the non-zero digit in the output.\n\n4. Let me examine the length and structure more carefully:\n   - All inputs are 24 elements long\n   - All outputs are 24 elements long\n   - The outputs seem to have a specific pattern where they end with multiple zeros\n\n5. Looking at where the non-zero values appear in the outputs:\n   - Example 1: 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Example 2: 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Example 3: 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n6. I notice that the outputs seem to be organized in groups or segments, and there's a consistent pattern of trailing zeros.\n\n7. Let me count the non-zero elements:\n   - Example 1 input: 15 sixes, output: 15 sixes\n   - Example 2 input: 11 sixes, output: 11 sixes\n   - Example 3 input: 10 ones, output: 10 ones\n\n8. The key insight: The rule appears to take all the non-zero values from the input, arrange them in a specific pattern at the beginning of the output, and fill the rest with zeros.\n\n9. Looking more closely at the arrangement pattern in the outputs, it seems like the non-zero values are arranged in a specific sequence that creates groups, with the remaining positions filled with zeros.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the rule appears to be:\n- Count the non-zero values in the input\n- Create a specific pattern using those non-zero values at the start of the output\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros\n- The pattern seems to follow a specific grouping structure\n\nFor the test input:\nInput: 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\nCounting the 7s: there are 11 sevens in the input.\n\nFollowing the pattern observed in the examples, the output should arrange these 11 sevens in the characteristic pattern and fill the rest with zeros.\n\n<answer>7 7 0 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

If I rotate the entire sequence:\n\nExample 1: Rotating left by 4 positions:\nInput:  3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\nOutput: 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nWait, let me check if this is a left rotation by 4:\nTaking the first 4 elements (3 0 0 0) and moving them after position 8:\n0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nThis doesn't match either.\n\nLet me try right rotation by 3:\nMoving last 3 elements to front: 3 3 3 | 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\nResult: 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nThis matches! Let me verify with other examples:\n\nExample 2: Right rotation by 3:\nInput:  5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\nLast 3: 5 5 5, remaining: 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\nResult: 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\n\nThis matches!\n\nExample 3: Right rotation by 3:\nInput:  1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nLast 3: 0 1, remaining: 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nWait, this doesn't work exactly...\n\nLet me reconsider. Maybe it's a left rotation by 2:\n\nExample 3: Left rotation by 2:\nInput:  1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nRemove first 2: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nAdd to end: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n\nThis doesn't match either.\n\nLet me try right rotation by 2 for Example 3:\nLast 2 elements: 0 1\nRemaining: 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nResult: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis doesn't match the expected output either.\n\nLet me go back and check the pattern more systematically. The rule appears to be a right cyclic shift by 3 positions for Examples 1 and 2. Let me verify Example 3 with different shift amounts.\n\nActually, let me check if it's consistently a right shift by 3:\n\nFor the test input:\nInput: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRight shift by 3 (move last 3 elements to front):\nLast 3: 2 2 2\nRemaining: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nResult: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n<answer>2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</answer>",

Let me analyze the groups:\n\nLooking more carefully, I see that in each continuous sequence of 2s, the first half (or first portion) becomes 8s, while the second half remains 2s.\n\nLet me verify this hypothesis:\n\nExample 1:\n- First group of 2s: positions 0-7 (8 consecutive 2s) \u2192 first 4 become 8s, last 4 remain 2s\n- Second group of 2s: positions 9-20 (12 consecutive 2s) \u2192 first 6 become 8s, last 6 remain 2s\n\nExample 2:\n- First group: position 0-1 (2 consecutive 2s) \u2192 first 1 becomes 8, last 1 remains 2\n- Second group: positions 4-13 (10 consecutive 2s) \u2192 first 5 become 8s, last 5 remain 2s\n\nExample 3:\n- First group: positions 1-2 (2 consecutive 2s) \u2192 first 1 becomes 8, last 1 remains 2\n- Second group: positions 4-12 (9 consecutive 2s) \u2192 first 4 become 8s, last 5 remain 2s\n\nThe pattern is: For each continuous sequence of 2s, replace the first half (rounded down) with 8s, keep the rest as 2s.\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\nInput: 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n\nGroups of consecutive 2s:\n- Positions 1-9: 9 consecutive 2s \u2192 first 4 become 8s, last 5 remain 2s\n- Positions 17-22: 6 consecutive 2s \u2192 first 3 become 8s, last 3 remain 2s\n\n<answer>0 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 2 0</answer>",

The sequences that differ are:\n- \"0 0 0\" at the beginning (positions 0-2)\n- \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" at the end (positions 22-28)\n\nShifting each sequence two positions to the left:\n- The initial \"0 0 0\" would shift to positions -2,-1,0, but since we can't go negative, it likely stays at the beginning or gets truncated\n- The ending sequence \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" at positions 22-28 would shift to positions 20-26\n\nWait, let me reconsider the pattern more carefully by looking at the exact transformations:\n\nExample 1: The \"0 0\" moves from the end toward the center\nExample 3: The long sequence of 0s moves toward the center\n\nIt seems like minority sequences move two positions toward the center of the grid.\n\nFor the test input, the sequence \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" at the end should move two positions left (toward center), and the \"0 0 0\" at the beginning should move two positions right (toward center).\n\n<answer>0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7</answer>",

In the output, these 0s have moved 2 positions to the left.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:  4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\nOutput: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nThis example shows all the same values (4s), so the input and output are identical.

The 0s appear to have shifted 2 positions to the left, and the 6s have filled in the gaps.\n\nLet me verify this pattern:\n- In Example 1: The 0s at positions 26-27 moved to positions 24-25\n- In Example 3: The 0s at positions 5-18 moved to positions 3-16\n\nThe pattern seems to be: **Move all non-majority values 2 positions to the left, and fill the remaining positions with the majority value.**\n\nLet me check this rule:\n- Example 1: Majority value is 6, minority values (0s) shift left by 2\n- Example 2: All values are the same (4), so no change\n- Example 3: Majority value is 6, minority values (0s) shift left by 2\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\nInput: 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe majority value appears to be 7 (appears 16 times), and the minority value is 0 (appears 13 times). Wait, let me recount: there are 16 sevens and 13 zeros, so 7 is indeed the majority.\n\nThe 0s are at positions: 0,1,2 and 22,23,24,25,26,27,28\nMoving them 2 positions left: positions -2,-1,0 and 20,21,22,23,24,25,26\n\nSince we can't have negative positions, the first three 0s would move to positions 0,1 (losing one 0), and the trailing 0s move from positions 22-28 to positions 20-26.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the pattern more carefully by looking at the exact transformations:\n\nExample 1: The sequence \"6 6 0 0 6\" at the end becomes \"0 0 6 6 6\" - the 0s moved left by 2, displacing 6s\nExample 3: The 0s moved left by 2 positions, and 6s filled the end\n\nApplying to test input:\n0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nMoving all 0s left by 2 positions:\n0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7\n\n<answer>0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7</answer>",

Wait, let me recount: there are 19 sevens and 10 zeros, so 7 is the majority element.\n\nThe minority sequence is the initial \"0 0 0\" at positions 0-2. According to the rule, this should shift 2 positions to the left. However, since it's already at the leftmost positions, it cannot move further left.\n\nLet me reconsider the pattern. Looking more carefully:\n\nIn Example 1: The minority sequence moves left by 2, and the majority element extends to fill the rightmost positions.\nIn Example 3: The minority sequence moves left by 2, and the majority element extends to fill the rightmost positions.\n\nFor the test input, if the sequence \"0 0 0\" at the beginning cannot move left, perhaps the rule is about moving sequences toward the center or following a different logic.\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. The pattern might be that minority sequences move 2 positions toward the beginning/left side of the grid, and the majority element fills the remaining space.\n\nFor the test input:\nInput: 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe sequence \"0 0 0\" at the start stays put (can't move further left), and the sequence \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" at the end should move 2 positions left.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7</answer>",

No, that's not right.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe the rule is about reflecting or mirroring around the center:\n\nFor a 12-element array, the center would be between positions 5 and 6.\n- Position 7 would map to position 4 (7-3=4, where 3 is the distance from center)\n- Position 8 would map to position 3\n- Position 9 would map to position 2\n\nLet me check Example 3:\n- Positions 8,9 should map to positions 3,2\n- But the output shows 0s at positions 5,6\n- This doesn't match.\n\nLet me reconsider. Maybe the rule is simpler - perhaps it's a rotation by a fixed number of positions.\n\nChecking Example 2 again:\nIf I rotate the input left by 3 positions:\nOriginal: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8\nRotate left by 3: 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8\nThis matches the output!\n\nLet me verify with Example 1:\nInput:  5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\nRotate left by 3: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\nOutput: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\nThis doesn't match exactly - there's an extra 0 at the end.\n\nLet me try Example 3:\nInput:  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5\nRotate left by 3: 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 5\nOutput: 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 5\nThis matches!\n\nSo the rule appears to be: rotate the sequence left by 3 positions.\n\nLet me double-check Example 1:\nInput:  5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\nRotate left by 3: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\nBut the expected output is: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nHmm, there's still a discrepancy. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, let me check if it's a right rotation by 3:\nExample 2:\nInput:  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8\nRotate right by 3: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8\nThis doesn't match.\n\nLet me try left rotation by 3 again more carefully:\nExample 1:\nPositions: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\nInput:     5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5  5\nAfter rotating left by 3, position i goes to position (i-3) mod 12:\nPosition 0\u21929, 1\u219210, 2\u219211, 3\u21920, 4\u21921, 5\u21922, 6\u21923, 7\u21924, 8\u21925, 9\u21926, 10\u21927, 11\u21928\nSo: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n\nWait, that's not how rotation works. Let me be more careful.\n\nRotating left by 3 means taking the first 3 elements and moving them to the end:\nInput:  5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\nTake first 3: [5 5 0], remaining: [0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5]\nResult: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nWait, that's still not right. Let me think about this as shifting elements:\n\nActually, rotating left by 3 means each element moves 3 positions to the left:\nInput:  5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\nElement at position 3 moves to position 0: 0\nElement at position 4 moves to position 1: 0  \nElement at position 5 moves to position 2: 0\nAnd so on...\n\nThis gives: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n\nBut the expected output has a 0 at the end. Let me reconsider the pattern.\n\nActually, let me try a different interpretation. Maybe it's rotating right by 3:\nEach element moves 3 positions to the right (with wraparound):\nInput:  5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\nElement at pos 0 goes to pos 3: 5\nElement at pos 1 goes to pos 4: 5\nElement at pos 2 goes to pos 5: 0\n...\nElement at pos 9 goes to pos 0: 5\nElement at pos 10 goes to pos 1: 5  \nElement at pos 11 goes to pos 2: 5\n\nThis gives: 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\nThis doesn't match either.\n\nLet me go back to the examples and try to see the pattern differently.\n\nActually, let me try rotating LEFT by 3 positions correctly:\nThis means the sequence shifts left, and the first 3 elements wrap around to the end.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:  5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\nShift left by 3: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 (first 3 elements [5 5 0] go to end, but this gives all 5s at end)\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a simple left shift by 3:\nInput:  5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\nRemove first 3 and add them to end: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 [5 5 0]\nResult: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\nThis matches Example 1 if the last element is just the first element of the original sequence!\n\nLet me verify:\nExample 2:\nInput:  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8\nShift left by 3: 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nThis matches!\n\nExample 3:\nInput:  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5\nShift left by 3: 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 5\nThis matches!\n\nSo the rule is: shift the sequence left by 3 positions (elements wrap around).\n\nNow for the test input:\nInput: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\nShift left by 3: 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\n<answer>6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6</answer>",

Let me check if there's a reflection or rotation pattern.\n\nLooking more carefully at the positions:\n- Grid length is 12 in all cases\n- Center would be around positions 5.5 (between 5 and 6)\n\nLet me try a different approach - looking at the distance from center:\n\nExample 2: Position 7 is 1.5 units from center (7-5.5=1.5), and it moves to position 4, which is also 1.5 units from center (5.5-4=1.5). This suggests reflection across the center!\n\nLet me verify this reflection hypothesis:\n\nExample 1:\n- Position 2 \u2192 reflects to position 9 (5.5*2-2=9), but output has 0 at position 2\n- Wait, let me reconsider...\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. Let me check if the 0s are being moved to create symmetry or some other pattern.\n\nLooking again at Example 2:\nInput:  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 (0 at position 7)\nOutput: 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 (0 at position 4)\n\nThe 0 moved from position 7 to position 4. If I consider the center between positions 5 and 6, then position 7 is reflected to position 4 across this center line.\n\nLet me verify with Example 3:\nInput:  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 (0s at positions 8,9)\nOutput: 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 (0s at positions 5,6)\n\nPosition 8 reflects to position 3, position 9 reflects to position 2... but the output has 0s at 5,6.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe the rule is about moving 0s toward the center by a fixed amount.\n\nAfter more careful analysis, I think the rule is: reflect the positions of 0s across the center line of the grid.\n\nFor a 12-element grid, positions reflect as: 0\u219411, 1\u219410, 2\u21949, 3\u21948, 4\u21947, 5\u21946\n\nApplying this to the test input:\nInput: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\nThe 0s are at positions 8, 9, 10, 11\nThese reflect to positions 3, 2, 1, 0\n\n<answer>0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6</answer>",

The initial sequence in the test is \"3 3 3\" (length 3), not length 5. Let me check if the rule adapts to the length of the initial sequence.\n\nLooking more carefully at the examples, I see the initial sequences are all length 5, and isolated values get replaced by length 5 sequences.

Looking more carefully:\n\nActually, the pattern seems to be: for each consecutive sequence of 2s, change the first half (rounded up) to 8s.\n\nFor sequences of length n:\n- Length 1: first 1 becomes 8 (all)\n- Length 2: first 1 becomes 8\n- Length 3: first 2 become 8\n- Length 4: first 2 become 8\n- Length 14: first 7 become 8\n\nWait, let me check Example 1 again more carefully:\n- \"2 2 2 2\": becomes \"8 8 2 2\" (first 2 of 4)\n- \"2 2 2\": becomes \"8 2 2\" (first 1 of 3)\n\nSo the rule is: for a sequence of n consecutive 2s, change the first \u230an/2\u230b + (n%2) elements to 8, which simplifies to \u2308n/2\u2309 for odd n and n/2 for even n.\n\nActually, let me be more precise: change the first \u230a(n+1)/2\u230b elements to 8.\n\nNow applying this to the test input:\nInput: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSequences:\n1. \"2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\" (length 8): change first 4 to 8 \u2192 \"8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2\"\n2. \"2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\" (length 9): change first 5 to 8 \u2192 \"8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2\"\n\n<answer>8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",
