      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_blue', 'target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])']\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7.

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]).

Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])']\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])']\n\n",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_red', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)']\nAgent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])']\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[3.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 0.5]: I am in square[3.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 1.5]: I am in square[3.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 2.5]: I am in square[3.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7.

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]).

Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3.

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4.

Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'target_blue', 'target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 3.5]: I am in square[1.5, 3.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'box_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])']\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])']\n\n",
