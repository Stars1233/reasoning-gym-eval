Your task is to calculate the average speed and the most probable speed of the molecules in the gas using the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The average speed is calculated using the formula `v_avg = \u221a(8RT/\u03c0M)`, and the most probable speed is calculated using the formula `v_mp = \u221a(2RT/M)`. Return a dictionary containing both the average speed and the most probable speed in meters per second (m/s).\n\nThe input and output requirements are as follows:\n\nInput:\n    temperature (float): The absolute temperature of the gas in Kelvin.\n    molar_mass (float): The molar mass of the gas in kg/mol.\n\nOutput:\n    return (dict): A dictionary with two keys:\n    - average_speed (float): The average speed of the gas molecules in m/s.\n    - most_probable_speed (float): The most probable speed of the gas molecules in m/s.\n\nGiven the following input:\n\n{'temperature': 288.8444683529449, 'molar_mass': 0.0519096798943469}\n\nCan you predict the output without writing any code? Please think and then provide the exact output in the form of a JSON object as your final answer. The keys and values of the object should strictly match the output requirement as specified.\n\nTip: Here is a reference code snippet for this question.

Your task is to calculate the effusion ratio between the two gases, the effusion rates of each gas relative to the other, and the molar masses of each gas relative to the other.
