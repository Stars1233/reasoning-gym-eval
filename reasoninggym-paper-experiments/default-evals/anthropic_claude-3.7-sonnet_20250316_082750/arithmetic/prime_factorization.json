However, I notice that:\n751 = 7 \u00d7 107 + 2\n\nActually, I need to be more careful. Let me check if 751 is prime.\nI've verified it's not divisible by primes up to its square root.\n\nWait, let me try one more calculation:\n751 = 7 \u00d7 107 + 2\n\nLet me double-check: 7 \u00d7 107 = 749, and 749 + 2 = 751. So 7 is not a factor.\n\nI think 751 might be prime. Let me check once more with a few primes:\n751 = 751 \u00d7 1\n\n<answer>751</answer>",
