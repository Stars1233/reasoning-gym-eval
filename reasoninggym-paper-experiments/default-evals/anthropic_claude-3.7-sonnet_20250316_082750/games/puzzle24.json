We have two 1's, so 1 + 1 = 2, not enough.\n- 10 * 1 = 10, then we need 14 more. We have 1 and 2 left. 2 * 1 = 2, not enough.\n\nLet's try division:\n- 10 / 1 = 10, then we need 14 more. We have 1 and 2 left. 2 * 1 = 2, not enough.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n- (10 - 1) * 2 = 18, then we need 6 more. We have 1 left, not enough.\n- (10 + 1) * 2 = 22, then we need 2 more. We have 1 left, which is enough to add.\n\nSo: (10 + 1) * 2 + 1 = 24\n\nLet me verify: 10 + 1 = 11, 11 * 2 = 22, 22 + 1 = 24. This works!\n\n<answer>(10 + 1) * 2 + 1</answer>",

So the expression is: 4 * 6 / (7 / 7)\n\nBut that's not in the simplest form. Since 7 / 7 = 1, the expression is effectively:\n4 * 6 / 1 = 24\n\nActually, let me try another approach:\n(4 - 6) * 7 = -14\n-14 + 7 = -7, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try:\n(7 / 7) * 24 = 24, but we need to use 4 and 6.\n\nI think I need to be more systematic. Let me try:\n(7 - (4 / 7)) * 6 = (7 - 4/7) * 6 = (49/7 - 4/7) * 6 = 45/7 * 6 = 270/7 \u2248 38.57, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try:\n7 * (6 - 4/7) = 7 * (42/7 - 4/7) = 7 * 38/7 = 38, which is not 24.\n\nWhat about:\n(4 + 6) * (7 / 7) = 10 * 1 = 10, which is not 24.\n\nLet me try:\n4 * (6 + 7) - 7 = 4 * 13 - 7 = 52 - 7 = 45, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try:\n(4 + 6) * 7 - 7 = 10 * 7 - 7 = 70 - 7 = 63, which is not 24.\n\nWhat about:\n7 * (4 - 6/7) = 7 * (28/7 - 6/7) = 7 * 22/7 = 22, which is not 24.\n\nLet me try:\n(7 - 7) + (4 * 6) = 0 + 24 = 24\n\nThis works! So the expression is: (7 - 7) + (4 * 6)\nBut we can simplify this to: 4 * 6 + (7 - 7) or 4 * 6 + 0, which is just 4 * 6.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n<answer>4 * 6</answer>",
