Since column 3 already has a 3 in row 1, position (4,1) must be 3 and position (4,2) must be 4.\n\nRow 2 has 4 and 2, so it needs 1 and 3. Column 1 already has 4, and column 2 has 2, so positions (2,3) and (2,4) need 1 and 3. Since column 3 already has a 1 in row 4, position (2,3) must be 3 and position (2,4) must be 1.\n\nRow 1 has 3, so it needs 1, 2, and 4. Column 1 has no constraints yet, but column 3 has 3 and 1, and column 4 has 1, so position (1,1) must be either 1, 2, or 4. Looking at the top-left subgrid, we have 3, 4, and 2, so position (1,1) must be 1. For positions (1,3) and (1,4), we need 2 and 4. Since column 4 already has a 1, position (1,3) must be 4 and position (1,4) must be 2.\n\nRow 3 is empty, so it needs 1, 2, 3, and 4. Column 1 has 1 and 4, column 2 has 3 and 2, column 3 has 4, 3, and 1, and column 4 has 2 and 1. So position (3,1) must be 2, position (3,2) must be 1, position (3,3) must be 2, and position (3,4) must be 3.\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me reconsider row 3.\n\nColumn 1 has 1 and 4, so position (3,1) must be 2 or 3.\nColumn 2 has 3 and 2, so position (3,2) must be 1 or 4.\nColumn 3 has 4 and 3, so position (3,3) must be 2.\nColumn 4 has 2 and 1, so position (3,4) must be 3 or 4.\n\nLooking at the bottom-left subgrid, we need 1, 2, 3, 4. We've determined position (3,3) is 2, and position (4,1) is 3, so positions (3,1) and (4,2) must contain 1 and 4. Since position (4,2) must be 4, position (3,1) must be 2.\n\nFor positions (3,2) and (3,4), we need 1 and 3. Since position (3,4) must be 3, position (3,2) must be 1.\n\nThe completed puzzle is:\n\n<answer>\n1 3 4 2\n4 2 3 1\n2 1 4 3\n3 4 1 2\n</answer>",
