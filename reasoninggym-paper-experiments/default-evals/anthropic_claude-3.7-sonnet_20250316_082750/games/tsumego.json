There's also a White stone at O11 that seems isolated, and some White stones in the bottom right.\n\nExamining the G9-H9 area first: Black has a stone at I9, so if Black can play at F9, it would put those two White stones in atari.\n\nLet me check the bottom right area: There's a group of White stones at K6, L6, M6, L5 with a Black stone at K5. If Black plays at M5, it would put those White stones in a difficult position.\n\nThe move at F9 seems most promising as it directly captures two White stones.\n\n<answer>F9</answer>",
