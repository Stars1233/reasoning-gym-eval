The correct expression is:\n90 + 81 + 72 - 80 - 94 + 81 - 3 = 147\n\nBut I need to remove the 3. Let me check if I can derive 3 from the numbers:\n- 81 / 27 = 3, but 27 isn't in our list\n\nI think I have the solution:\n90 + 81 - 80 + 72 - 94 + 78 = 147\nAnd 78 = 81 - 3, so we're using the second 81 here.\n\nSo the final expression is:\n90 + 81 - 80 + 72 - 94 + (81 - 3) = 147\nWhich simplifies to:\n90 + 81 - 80 + 72 - 94 + 81 - 3 = 147\n\nBut I need to express this without creating new numbers.

Let me try a completely different approach.\n\nI think I have it:\n90 + 81 + 81 - 94 - 80 + 72 - 3 = 147\n\nLet me see if I can express 3 using the given numbers:\n- 81 / 27 = 3, but 27 isn't in our list\n- 90 / 30 = 3, but 30 isn't in our list\n- 72 / 24 = 3, but 24 isn't in our list\n\nWait, I see it now:\n90 + 81 + 81 - 94 - 80 + 72 - 3 = 147\nAnd 94 - 90 = 4, so 3 = 4 - 1\n\nLet me try one more time:\n81 + 81 + 72 - 80 - 90 + 94 - 11 = 147\n\nI need to be more methodical. Let me try:\n81 + 81 - 72 + 90 - 80 + 94 - 47 = 147\n\nI think I've been overcomplicating this. Let me try a simpler approach:\n81 + 81 - 72 + 90 - 80 + 47 = 147\nAnd 94 - 47 = 47\n\nSo the expression is:\n81 + 81 - 72 + 90 - 80 + (94 - 47) = 147\n\nBut this creates 47, which isn't in our list.\n\nLet me try one last approach:\n81 + 81 - 72 + 90 - 80 + 94 - 47 = 147\n81 + 81 - 72 + 90 - 80 + 94 - 47 = 147\n\nI've been trying too many complex expressions.
