Let me analyze the board and determine the sequence of moves needed.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the vehicles and their orientations:\n- AA: horizontal, needs to reach the right exit\n- BB: horizontal, at the top left\n- CC: horizontal, at the right side of the 4th row\n- DD: horizontal, at the left side of the 5th row\n- EE: horizontal, at the left side of the bottom row\n- FF: horizontal, at the middle of the bottom row\n- G: vertical, in the 2nd column\n- H: vertical, in the 4th column\n- I: vertical, in the 5th column\n- J: vertical, in the 6th column\n\nTo move AA to the exit, I need to clear the path to the right. I see that I need to move:\n1. I needs to move up or down\n2. J needs to move up or down\n3. C needs to move left or right\n\nLooking at the constraints:\n- I can't move I up because it's blocked by J\n- I need to move J up to free I\n- I can then move I down\n- Then I need to move C left to clear the path for AA\n\nThe sequence of moves:\n1. J-1 (move J up)\n2. I+1 (move I down)\n3. C-2 (move C left)\n4. A+3 (move AA to the exit)\n\n<answer>J-1 I+1 C-2 A+3</answer>",
