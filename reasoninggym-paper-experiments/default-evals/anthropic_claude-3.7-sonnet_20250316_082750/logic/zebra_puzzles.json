Let me reconsider...\n\nIf Arnold is in house 3 (directly left of daffodils lover in house 4), then Alice (daffodils lover) cannot be in house 4 because house 4 has lilies.\n\nLet me restart. The person in house 4 loves lilies, soup, and coffee.\nIf Alice loves daffodils and drinks water, she can't be in house 4.\nIf Arnold is directly left of the daffodils lover, and the daffodils lover isn't in house 4, then Arnold must be in house 2 and the daffodils lover in house 3.\n\nSo Alice is in house 3 with daffodils and water.\nArnold is in house 2 with carnations and grilled cheese.\nHouse 4 has lilies, soup, and coffee.\n\nFrom clue 6: Carol is directly left of Bob.\nIf Arnold is in house 2 and Alice in house 3, then Carol must be in house 1 and Bob in house 2.\n\nBut this conflicts with Arnold being in house 2. Let me rethink this...\n\nThe key insight is that clue 4 says Arnold is directly left of the daffodils lover, and clue 10 says the water drinker (Alice from clue 2) loves daffodils.\n\nSo Arnold is directly left of Alice. If Alice is in house 3, then Arnold is in house 2.\nThis leaves houses 1 and 4 for Carol and Bob.\nFrom clue 6, Carol is directly left of Bob, so Carol must be in house 1 and Bob in house 4.\n\n<answer>Carol</answer>",
