If there's no such pattern (no non-zero followed by 0), the output remains the same as the input.\n\nFor the test input: 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\n\nThe most frequent non-zero number is 9.\nThere's no non-zero number followed by a 0, so the output should be the same as the input.\n\nWait, I need to look more carefully. In Example 1, the 2 is followed by a 0, and that 0 is replaced by a 7, and the last 7 becomes a 0.\nIn Example 2, the 2 is followed by a 0, and that 0 is replaced by a 6, and the last 6 becomes a 0.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: If there's a 2 followed by a 0, replace that 0 with the most frequent non-zero number (other than 2), and replace the last occurrence of that number with a 0.\n\nIn the test input, there's a 2 at the end, not followed by a 0. So the output should be the same as the input.\n\n<answer>9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2</answer>",

The sequence of 7s shifts one position to the left, and the last 7 is replaced with 0.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:  2 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\nOutput: 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\nAgain, the first non-zero number (2) stays in place.

Find the first non-zero number in the sequence.\n2. Keep it in the same position.\n3. If there's a sequence of identical non-zero numbers after a zero that follows the first non-zero number, shift that sequence one position to the left.\n4. Replace the last position of that sequence with 0.\n5. If there's no such sequence, the output remains the same as the input.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\nInput: 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\n\nThe first non-zero number is 9 at position 1. There's a sequence of 9s, but they're not after a zero that follows the first non-zero number (they are the first non-zero numbers themselves). After the 9s, we have zeros and then a 2. There's no sequence of identical non-zero numbers after a zero following the first non-zero number.\n\nSo, the output should be the same as the input.\n\n<answer>9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2</answer>",

Count the number of non-zero digits at the beginning (call this A)\n2. Count the total number of zeros (call this B)\n3. Count the number of non-zero digits at the end (call this C)\n4. The output has A+C non-zero digits at the beginning, followed by B zeros, followed by the remaining non-zero digits\n\nFor the test input: 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\nA = 6 (six 4s at the beginning)\nB = 17 (seventeen 0s in the middle)\nC = 1 (one 4 at the end)\n\nSo the output should have A+C = 7 non-zero digits (4s) at the beginning, followed by B = 17 zeros, followed by any remaining non-zero digits (none in this case).\n\n<answer>4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

Looking more carefully:\n\nIn Example 1, the 7s start at position 3 and end at position 9 in the input.\nIn the output, they start at position 1 and end at position 7.\n\nIn Example 2, the 7s start at position 4 and end at position 8 in the input.\nIn the output, they start at position 2 and end at position 6.\n\nIn Example 3, the 4s start at position 3 and end at position 10 in the input.\nIn the output, they start at position 1 and end at position 8.\n\nSo the rule is: shift the entire block of non-zero numbers 2 positions to the left, maintaining their sequence and count.\n\nFor our test input with a single 3 at position 2, shifting it 2 positions left would place it at position 0.\n\n<answer>3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

It seems to maintain some leading zeros.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 5 1 3 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSimilar to Example 2, the non-zero sequence (8 2 8 5 1 3) is shifted left but keeps some leading zeros.\n\nThe rule appears to be: Move all non-zero numbers to the left (maintaining their order) while keeping the same total number of elements by adding zeros to the right. However, there seems to be a specific number of leading zeros to maintain.\n\nLooking at Examples 2 and 3, both have 5 leading zeros in the output. In Example 1, all non-zeros are shifted completely to the left.\n\nI think the rule is: Count the number of leading zeros in the input until the first non-zero number. If this count is greater than 5, reduce it to 5 in the output. If it's already 5 or fewer, keep that number of leading zeros.\n\nFor the test input:\n0 0 0 0 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0\n\nThere are 4 leading zeros before the first non-zero number (6). Since 4 is less than 5, we keep all 4 leading zeros, then place all non-zero numbers in order, followed by zeros at the end.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0</answer>",

The transformation seems to affect only the non-zero elements at the beginning.\n\nLooking at the pattern of changes:\n- In Example 1: 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 \u2192 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6\n- In Example 2: 3 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 \u2192 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 3\n- In Example 3: 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2\n\nThe rule appears to be: The second element becomes 0, and the last non-zero element moves to the position after the second-to-last non-zero element.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input:\nInput: 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSince the second element is already 0, it stays as 0. The last non-zero element (the 8th element, which is 9) should move to after the second-to-last non-zero element (the 7th element, which is 9).\n\nSo the output should be:\n9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, this doesn't show any change. Let me reconsider the pattern...\n\nLooking more carefully, I see that in all examples, the second element becomes 0 (if it wasn't already), and the elements are rearranged in a specific way. The pattern seems to be:\n- Keep the first element\n- Make the second element 0\n- Keep the next elements until the first 0\n- After that, the pattern of non-zero and zero elements is preserved, but shifted\n\nFor the test input: 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\nThe second element is already 0, so it stays as 0.\n\nBased on the examples, the output should be:\n9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

It seems like the sequence of 6's at the beginning is shortened by 2, and the sequence of 6's at the end is lengthened by 2.\n\nAfter further analysis, I think the rule is: rotate the entire grid by one position to the right.

This suggests that the rule involves replacing some 0s with 3s.\n\nLet me analyze where these replacements happen:\n\nExample 1:\n- 0s at positions 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 become 3s\n- 0s at positions 11, 13, 14 remain 0s\n\nExample 2:\n- 0s at positions 5, 8, 10, 14 become 3s\n- 0s at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 remain 0s\n\nExample 3:\n- 0s at positions 2, 3, 6, 11, 14 become 3s\n- 0s at positions 7, 8, 9, 10 remain 0s\n\nThe pattern seems to be: a 0 is replaced with a 3 if it's adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a non-zero number. If a 0 is only adjacent to other 0s or at the edge with no non-zero neighbors, it remains 0.\n\nNow I'll apply this rule to the test input:\n4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nThe 0 at position 1 is adjacent to 4, so it becomes 3\nThe 0 at position 2 is adjacent to 5, so it becomes 3\nThe 0 at position 5 is adjacent to 5, so it becomes 3\nThe 0 at position 6 is adjacent to 9, so it becomes 3\nThe 0 at position 7 is adjacent to 9, so it becomes 3\nThe 0 at position 11 is adjacent to 9, so it becomes 3\nThe 0s at positions 12, 13, 14 are only adjacent to other 0s, so they remain 0\n\nTherefore, the output grid should be:\n4 3 3 5 5 3 3 3 9 9 9 3 0 0 0\n\n<answer>4 3 3 5 5 3 3 3 9 9 9 3 0 0 0</answer>",
