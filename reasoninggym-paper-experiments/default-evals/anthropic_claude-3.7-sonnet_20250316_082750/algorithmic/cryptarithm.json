The rightmost column gives A + M = H (mod 10). The middle column gives I + J = A (mod 10) with a possible carry. The leftmost column gives J + H = A (mod 10) with a possible carry.\n\nLooking at the leftmost column, if J + H = A, there must be a carry from the middle column, since A appears in the sum. So J + H = A + 10.\n\nFrom the middle column, I + J + carry = A + 10*carry_to_leftmost.

So Y must be 9 and Q must be 9 + 10 - 0 = 19, which is not a single digit. \n\nLet me reconsider. If there's a carry from the rightmost column, then 0 + Q + 1 = Y. Since Q and Y are different digits, Q + 1 = Y.\n\nFor the second column from right, Y + I = V (possibly with a carry). If Y = Q + 1, and we substitute, we get Q + 1 + I = V.\n\nFor the third column, Y + T = Y + carry. Since T = 0, this means Y + 0 = Y + carry, so there must be a carry of 1 from the second column.\n\nSo now we have:\nQ + 1 + I = V + 10 (with a carry of 1)\n\nFor the leftmost column, K + I + 1 = X (with the carry from the third column).\n\nLet's try some values. If Q = 8, then Y = 9. If I = 2, then 9 + 2 = 11, so V = 1 with a carry of 1. Then K + 2 + 1 = X. If K = 6, then X = 9, but Y is already 9, so this doesn't work.\n\nLet's try Q = 7, Y = 8. If I = 3, then 8 + 3 = 11, so V = 1 with a carry of 1. Then K + 3 + 1 = X. If K = 5, then X = 9.\n\nLet me verify:\nK = 5, Y = 8, T = 0, I = 3, Q = 7, X = 9, V = 1\n\n```\n  5880\n+ 3037\n------\n  9818\n```\n\nChecking: 5880 + 3037 = 8917, not 9818. This doesn't work.\n\nLet me try more systematically.\n\nSince T = 0, and Y + T = Y + carry, there must be a carry from the second column.\nSo Y + I = V + 10 (with a carry of 1)\n\nFrom the rightmost column, T + Q = Y + carry. Since T = 0, we have Q = Y - carry.\nIf there's no carry from the rightmost column, then Q = Y, which violates the uniqueness constraint.\nSo there must be a carry, and Q = Y - 1 + 10 = Y + 9.\nSince Q is a digit (0-9), Y can be at most 0, which means Q = 9.\n\nSo Y = 0, Q = 9, T = 0. But Y and T can't both be 0.\n\nLet me rethink this. If T = 0, then from the rightmost column, 0 + Q = Y or 0 + Q = Y + 10 (with a carry).\nIf 0 + Q = Y, then Q = Y, which violates uniqueness.\nSo 0 + Q = Y + 10, which means Q = Y + 10. Since Q is a digit, Y must be 0 and Q must be 0 + 10 = 10, which is not a single digit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the third column from the right: Y + T = Y (possibly with a carry)\nThis means T = 0 or T = 10 (if there's a carry from the previous column).\nIf T = 10, that's not a single digit, so T must be 0.\n\nNow, from the third column: Y + 0 = Y + carry\nThis means there must be a carry of 1 from the second column.\n\nFrom the second column: Y + I = V + 10 (with a carry of 1)\nThis means Y + I = V + 10\n\nFrom the rightmost column: 0 + Q = Y + carry\nIf there's no carry, then Q = Y, which violates uniqueness.\nSo there must be a carry, and 0 + Q + 1 = Y + 10\nThis means Q + 1 = Y + 10\nSince Y and Q are digits, Y must be 0 and Q must be 9.\n\nSo Y = 0, Q = 9, T = 0. But Y and T can't both be 0.\n\nLet me try a completely different approach and work with the constraints more carefully.\n\nFrom the third column: Y + T = Y + carry\nThis means T = carry, so T is either 0 (if no carry) or 1 (if there's a carry).\n\nIf T = 0:\nFrom the rightmost column: 0 + Q = Y + carry\nIf there's no carry, then Q = Y, which violates uniqueness.\nSo there must be a carry, and 0 + Q + 1 = Y + 10\nThis means Q + 1 = Y + 10\nSince Y and Q are digits, Y must be 0 and Q must be 9.\nBut then Y = T = 0, which violates uniqueness.\n\nSo T must be 1:\nFrom the rightmost column: 1 + Q = Y + carry\nIf there's no carry, then 1 + Q = Y\nIf there's a carry, then 1 + Q = Y + 10\n\nFrom the third column: Y + 1 = Y + carry\nThis means there must be a carry of 1 from the second column.\n\nFrom the second column: Y + I = V + 10 (with a carry of 1)\nThis means Y + I = V + 10\n\nLet's try Y = 8, then from the rightmost column, 1 + Q = 8 (if no carry) or 1 + Q = 18 (if there's a carry).\nIf 1 + Q = 8, then Q = 7.\nIf 1 + Q = 18, then Q = 17, which is not a single digit.\n\nSo Y = 8, Q = 7, T = 1.\n\nFrom the second column: 8 + I = V + 10\nThis means I = V + 2\n\nFrom the leftmost column: K + I = X + carry\nIf there's no carry from the third column, then K + I = X\nIf there's a carry, then K + I + 1 = X\n\nSince Y + T = Y + carry from the third column, and Y = 8, T = 1, we have 8 + 1 = 8 + carry, so there must be a carry of 1 from the third column.\n\nSo K + I + 1 = X\n\nIf I = 3, then V = 1, and K + 3 + 1 = X.
