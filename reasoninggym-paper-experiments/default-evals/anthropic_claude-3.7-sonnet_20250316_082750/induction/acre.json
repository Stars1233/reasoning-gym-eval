Purple rubber sphere + red rubber cylinder \u2192 off (repeated)\n\nFrom examples 2 and 3, I can see that the gray metal sphere is a blicket (activates the detector), while the cyan metal cube is not.\n\nFrom example 5, I can see that the red metal cube is a blicket.\n\nFrom examples 4 and 6, I can see that when the purple rubber sphere and red rubber cylinder are placed together, the detector stays off. This means neither of these objects is a blicket.\n\nSince the red rubber cylinder was part of a combination that did not activate the detector, and was never shown to activate the detector on its own, I can determine that it will not activate the detector.\n\n<answer>off</answer>",

      "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal sphere, cyan metal cube \u2192 on\ngray metal sphere \u2192 on\ncyan metal cube \u2192 off\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder \u2192 off\nred metal cube \u2192 on\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder \u2192 off\n\nNew test case:\npurple rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?",
