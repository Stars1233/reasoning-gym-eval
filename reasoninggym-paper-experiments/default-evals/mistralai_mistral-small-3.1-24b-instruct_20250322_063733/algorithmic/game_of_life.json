Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).\n\nWe also need to consider the wrapping topology, which means that the grid wraps around at the edges. This means that the neighbors of a cell on the edge of the grid include cells on the opposite edge.\n\nLet's go through the steps to determine the next state of the grid:\n\n1. **Count the live neighbors for each cell**: For each cell in the grid, count the number of live neighbors. Since the grid wraps around, we need to consider the neighbors in a circular manner.\n\n2. **Apply the rules**: Based on the count of live neighbors, apply the rules of the Game of Life to determine the next state of each cell.\n\nAfter applying these steps, the next state of the grid is:\n\n<answer>\n[\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],\n [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n</answer>",

This means that the neighbors of a cell on the edge of the grid can include cells on the opposite edge.\n\nLet's go through the steps to determine the next state of the grid:\n\n1. Count the live neighbors for each cell.\n2. Apply the rules of the Game of Life to each cell based on the count of live neighbors.\n3. Update the grid to reflect the new state.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Count the live neighbors for each cell**:\n   - For each cell, check all 8 possible neighbors (including wrapping around the edges).\n   - Count the number of live neighbors.\n\n2. **Apply the rules**:\n   - If a cell is live and has fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors, it dies.\n   - If a cell is live and has 2 or 3 live neighbors, it stays alive.\n   - If a cell is dead and has exactly 3 live neighbors, it becomes alive.\n\n3. **Update the grid**:\n   - Create a new grid with the updated states of the cells.\n\nAfter applying these steps, the resulting grid after 1 step of simulation is:\n\n<answer>[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]</answer>",

Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).\n\nGiven the initial board:\n```\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],\n [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n```\n\nWe need to count the live neighbors for each cell and apply the rules. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Count live neighbors for each cell**: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors in the Moore neighborhood (8 surrounding cells, wrapping around the edges).\n\n2. **Apply the rules**:\n   - If a cell is live and has fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors, it dies.\n   - If a cell is live and has 2 or 3 live neighbors, it stays alive.\n   - If a cell is dead and has exactly 3 live neighbors, it becomes alive.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the new state of the board is:\n\n<answer>\n[\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n</answer>",

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).\n\nWe also need to consider the wrapping topology, which means that the grid wraps around at the edges. This means that the neighbors of a cell at the edge of the grid include cells from the opposite edge.\n\nLet's go through the steps to determine the next state of the grid:\n\n1. **Count the live neighbors for each cell**: For each cell in the grid, count the number of live neighbors. Since the grid wraps around, we need to consider the cells on the opposite edges as neighbors.\n\n2. **Apply the rules**: Based on the number of live neighbors, apply the rules of the Game of Life to determine the state of each cell in the next generation.\n\nAfter applying these steps, the resulting grid after one step of simulation is:\n\n<answer>\n[\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n</answer>",
