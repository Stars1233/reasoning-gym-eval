The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-81) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (27). The factors of -81 are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b19, \u00b127, \u00b181, and the factors of 27 are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b19, \u00b127. Therefore, the possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b19, \u00b127, \u00b181, \u00b11/3, \u00b13/3, \u00b19/3, \u00b127/3, \u00b181/3, \u00b11/9, \u00b13/9, \u00b19/9, \u00b127/9, \u00b181/9, \u00b11/27, \u00b13/27, \u00b19/27, \u00b127/27, \u00b181/27.\n\nTesting these values, we find that p = 1 is a root of the equation. We can then factor the equation as (p - 1)(27*p**2 + 37*p + 81) = 0. The quadratic equation 27*p**2 + 37*p + 81 = 0 has no real roots, as its discriminant (37**2 - 4*27*81) is negative.\n\nTherefore, the only real solution is:\n\n<answer>1.0000</answer>",
