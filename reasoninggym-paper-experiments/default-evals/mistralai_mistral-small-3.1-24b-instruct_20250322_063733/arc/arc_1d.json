If there are no zeros in the input, the output remains unchanged.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n- Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n- Observation: There are zeros in the input grid. According to the rule, the first four elements and the last four elements should be replaced with zeros. The middle part of the input remains unchanged.\n- The most frequent value in the input grid is zero.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

The rule seems to involve filling in zeros with the value of the nearest non-zero element to the left.\n2. For each zero in the input, if there is a non-zero element to its left, the zero is replaced by that non-zero element in the output.\n3. If there is no non-zero element to the left, the zero remains unchanged.\n\n**Derivation of the Rule:**\n- For each position in the input grid, check the value to the left.\n- If the value to the left is non-zero, replace the current zero with that value.\n- If the value to the left is zero, leave the current zero unchanged.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\nInput: 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\n- The first five elements are non-zero, so they remain the same: 2 2 2 2 2\n- The next three elements are zeros. The nearest non-zero element to the left is 2, so they become: 2 2 2\n- The next element is a zero. The nearest non-zero element to the left is 2, so it becomes: 2\n- The next three elements are zeros. The nearest non-zero element to the left is 2, so they become: 2 2 2\n- The next element is a zero. The nearest non-zero element to the left is 2, so it becomes: 2\n- The next element is a zero. The nearest non-zero element to the left is 2, so it becomes: 2\n- The next three elements are zeros. There is no non-zero element to the left, so they remain: 0 0 0\n\n**Final Output:**\n<answer>2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0</answer>",

It should be shifted to the position right after the first sequence of zeros, which is the 10th position.\n- The last occurrence of '3' is at the 17th position. It should be shifted to the second last position, which is the 27th position.\n- All other numbers remain in their original positions.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0</answer>",

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Trigger**: The number '2' acts as a trigger. When '2' is encountered in the input grid, it initiates a change in the subsequent numbers.\n\n2. **Propagation Rule**: After encountering '2', all subsequent numbers in the grid are replaced by the number that immediately follows '2'. If there are no numbers after '2', then all subsequent numbers are replaced by '0'.\n\n3. **Boundary Condition**: The propagation stops at the end of the grid or when another '2' is encountered (though this is not shown in the examples provided).\n\n4. **Special Case for '0'**: If '2' is followed by '0', then all subsequent numbers are replaced by '0'.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\nInput:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\n- The number '2' is at position 10.\n- The number immediately following '2' is '0'.\n- According to the rule, all numbers after '2' should be replaced by '0'.\n\nTherefore, the output grid is:\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

The number of positions ahead varies depending on the example, but it appears to be consistent within each example.\n\nFor the test input, we need to determine the consistent pattern.

For other values, the complement is the highest value in the grid minus the value of the element.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\n**Input:** 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\n- The first element (0) in the input becomes the first element (7) in the output.\n- The second element (7) in the input becomes the second element (0) in the output.\n- The third element (7) in the input becomes the third element (0) in the output.\n- The fourth element (7) in the input becomes the fourth element (0) in the output.\n- The fifth element (7) in the input becomes the fifth element (0) in the output.\n- The sixth element (0) in the input becomes the sixth element (7) in the output.\n- The seventh element (0) in the input becomes the seventh element (7) in the output.\n- The eighth element (0) in the input becomes the eighth element (7) in the output.\n- The ninth element (0) in the input becomes the ninth element (7) in the output.\n- The tenth element (7) in the input becomes the tenth element (0) in the output.\n- The eleventh element (7) in the input becomes the eleventh element (0) in the output.\n- The twelfth element (7) in the input becomes the twelfth element (0) in the output.\n- The thirteenth element (7) in the input becomes the thirteenth element (0) in the output.\n- The fourteenth element (7) in the input becomes the fourteenth element (0) in the output.\n- The fifteenth element (0) in the input becomes the fifteenth element (7) in the output.\n- The sixteenth element (0) in the input becomes the sixteenth element (7) in the output.\n- The seventeenth element (0) in the input becomes the seventeenth element (7) in the output.\n- The eighteenth element (0) in the input becomes the eighteenth element (7) in the output.\n- The nineteenth element (7) in the input becomes the nineteenth element (0) in the output.\n- The twentieth element (7) in the input becomes the twentieth element (0) in the output.\n- The twenty-first element (0) in the input becomes the twenty-first element (7) in the output.\n- The twenty-second element (0) in the input becomes the twenty-second element (7) in the output.\n- The twenty-third element (0) in the input becomes the twenty-third element (7) in the output.\n- The twenty-fourth element (0) in the input becomes the twenty-fourth element (7) in the output.\n\n<answer>7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 7 7 7 7</answer>",

In Example 3, the zeros in the middle of the input are shifted to the left by one position in the output.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- The rule seems to involve shifting the positions of zeros in the input grid.\n- Specifically, if a zero is preceded by a non-zero value, it shifts to the right by one position.\n- If a zero is followed by a non-zero value, it shifts to the left by one position.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n- Input:  0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the derived rule:\n- The first three zeros are at the beginning, so they remain in place.\n- The zeros at the end remain in place.\n- The zeros in the middle (between the 7s and the last group of zeros) shift to the left by one position.\n\n**Final Output:**\n<answer>0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

Identify the first occurrence of a zero (0) in the input grid. It is at the 9th position.\n2. Replace the element immediately before this zero (0) with a zero (0). The element at the 8th position is 6, so replace it with 0.\n3. Since there are multiple zeros (0) in a row starting from the 9th position, replace all the elements before this sequence of zeros (0) with zeros (0). The elements from the 5th to the 8th position are 6 6 6 6, so replace them with 0 0 0 0.\n\n**Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",
