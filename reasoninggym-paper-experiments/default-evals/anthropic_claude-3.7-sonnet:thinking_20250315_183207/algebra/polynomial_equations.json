For a cubic polynomial, we can use the discriminant to understand the types of roots.\n\nI'll analyze the equation:\n-29g\u00b3 + 45g\u00b2 - 88g + 99 = 0\n\nTesting some values:\ng = 1: -29 + 45 - 88 + 99 = 27 > 0\ng = 2: -29(8) + 45(4) - 88(2) + 99 = -232 + 180 - 176 + 99 = -129 < 0\n\nSince the function changes sign between g = 1 and g = 2, there must be at least one real root in this interval.\n\nI'll use the bisection method to narrow down this root:\n- g = 1.5: f(1.5) \u2248 -29.625 < 0\n- g = 1.25: f(1.25) \u2248 2.672 > 0\n- g = 1.375: f(1.375) \u2248 -12.367 < 0\n- g = 1.3125: f(1.3125) \u2248 -4.429 < 0\n- g = 1.28125: f(1.28125) \u2248 -0.696 < 0\n- g = 1.265625: f(1.265625) \u2248 0.825 > 0\n\nContinuing this process and refining further, I find that the real root is approximately g \u2248 1.2741.\n\nBy computing the discriminant and analyzing the nature of the polynomial, I can confirm that this cubic equation has exactly one real root.\n\n<answer>1.2741</answer>",

A cubic equation can have either 1 or 3 real roots.\n\nLet me evaluate the function f(r) = -46r\u00b3 - 51r\u00b2 + 101 at different points:\n\nf(0) = 101 > 0\nf(1) = -46 - 51 + 101 = 4 > 0\nf(2) = -46(8) - 51(4) + 101 = -368 - 204 + 101 = -471 < 0\n\nThe function changes sign between r = 1 and r = 2, so there's at least one real root in that interval.\n\nLet me compute more values to narrow down the root:\nf(1.01) = -46(1.01)\u00b3 - 51(1.01)\u00b2 + 101 \u2248 1.6 > 0\nf(1.02) = -46(1.02)\u00b3 - 51(1.02)\u00b2 + 101 \u2248 -0.8 < 0\n\nThe root is between 1.01 and 1.02.\n\nUsing iterative methods and evaluating more points:\nf(1.016) \u2248 0.12 > 0\nf(1.017) \u2248 -0.12 < 0\n\nFurther refinement:\nf(1.0164) \u2248 0.01 > 0\nf(1.0165) \u2248 -0.01 < 0\n\nSo the root is approximately 1.01645.\n\nLooking at the discriminant of this cubic equation confirms there is only one real root.\n\nAccording to the instructions, I need to round to 4 decimal places, rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater. Since the 5th decimal place is 5, I round down to 1.0164.\n\n<answer>1.0164</answer>",

I'll try to locate this root through numerical methods.\n\nLet me evaluate the polynomial at different values:\nWhen r = 1: 46(1)\u00b3 + 51(1)\u00b2 - 101 = 46 + 51 - 101 = -4 < 0\nWhen r = 2: 46(2)\u00b3 + 51(2)\u00b2 - 101 = 46(8) + 51(4) - 101 = 368 + 204 - 101 = 471 > 0\n\nSo there's a root between 1 and 2. Let me narrow this down:\nWhen r = 1.01: 46(1.01)\u00b3 + 51(1.01)\u00b2 - 101 = -1.58106 < 0\nWhen r = 1.02: 46(1.02)\u00b3 + 51(1.02)\u00b2 - 101 = 0.87597 > 0\n\nFurther narrowing:\nWhen r = 1.016: 46(1.016)\u00b3 + 51(1.016)\u00b2 - 101 = -0.10726 < 0\nWhen r = 1.017: 46(1.017)\u00b3 + 51(1.017)\u00b2 - 101 = 0.13349 > 0\n\nEven more precisely:\nWhen r = 1.0164: 46(1.0164)\u00b3 + 51(1.0164)\u00b2 - 101 = -0.01309 < 0\nWhen r = 1.0165: 46(1.0165)\u00b3 + 51(1.0165)\u00b2 - 101 = 0.01069 > 0\n\nSo the root is between 1.0164 and 1.0165. According to the rounding instructions, since the 5th decimal place would be 5 or greater, I should round down to 1.0164.\n\nSince cubic equations can have up to three real roots, I need to check if there are more. By factoring the cubic polynomial and analyzing the remaining quadratic factor, I find that the other two roots are complex numbers, not real values.\n\n<answer>1.0164</answer>",
