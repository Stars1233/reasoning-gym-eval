          "full_model_response": "To solve this, I need to apply the rules of Conway's Game of Life for one step:\n1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies (underpopulation)\n2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives\n3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies (overpopulation)\n4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction)\n\nFirst, I'll identify the live cells in the initial grid:\n- (0,6), (0,7)\n- (1,4)\n- (4,6), (4,8)\n- (5,4), (5,7)\n- (6,9)\n- (8,2)\n\nFor each cell, I'll count its live neighbors and apply the rules:\n\nFor live cells:\n- (0,6): 1 live neighbor \u2192 dies\n- (0,7): 1 live neighbor \u2192 dies\n- (1,4): 0 live neighbors \u2192 dies\n- (4,6): 1 live neighbor \u2192 dies\n- (4,8): 1 live neighbor \u2192 dies\n- (5,4): 0 live neighbors \u2192 dies\n- (5,7): 2 live neighbors \u2192 survives\n- (6,9): 0 live neighbors \u2192 dies\n- (8,2): 0 live neighbors \u2192 dies\n\nFor dead cells:\n- (4,7): 3 live neighbors from (4,6), (4,8), (5,7) \u2192 becomes alive\n- (5,8): 3 live neighbors from (4,8), (5,7), (6,9) \u2192 becomes alive\n\nAll other cells either remain dead or die.\n\n<answer>[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]</answer>",
