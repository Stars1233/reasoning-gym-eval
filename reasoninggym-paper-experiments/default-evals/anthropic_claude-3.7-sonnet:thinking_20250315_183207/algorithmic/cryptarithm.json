Since L + carry must equal 0 (mod 10), and the carry from the previous column is 1, L must be 9.\n\nNow, with S = 0 and L = 9, I know V + 9 = D + 10, which means V = D + 1.\n\nFrom the next column: T + G + carry = J (mod 10) with a carry to the next column. This means T + G + 1 = J + 10, so T + G = J + 9.\n\nFinally, for the leftmost column, the carry becomes the leftmost J in the result. This means G + carry = J, so G + 1 = J, or G = J - 1.\n\nCombining T + G = J + 9 and G = J - 1, I get T + (J - 1) = J + 9, which means T = 10. This is impossible since T must be a single digit.\n\nI need to reconsider the alignment.

Since F is a digit (0-9) and c\u2082 is 0 or 1, we must have F = 0 and c\u2082 = 0.\n\nFrom Column 2: 0 + D + c\u2081 = X + 0\nSo D + c\u2081 = X\n\nFrom Column 1: Z + X = D + 10*c\u2081\nSubstituting D = X - c\u2081: Z + X = X - c\u2081 + 10*c\u2081\nSimplifying: Z = 9*c\u2081\n\nSince Z is a digit, c\u2081 must be 1, giving Z = 9.\n\nWith c\u2081 = 1, we have D + 1 = X, or X = D + 1.\n\nSince all letters must represent different digits, and F = 0, Z = 9, X = D + 1, let's set D = 1, making X = 2.\n\nThis leaves Y and B to be any distinct digits from {3,4,5,6,7,8}. I'll choose Y = 3 and B = 4.\n\nLet's verify: \n   309\n+ 4012\n------\n  4321\n\nThe addition works, and we have our mapping.\n\n<answer>B=4,D=1,F=0,X=2,Y=3,Z=9</answer>",
