Let's list and count them: \n- In \"are\" there is no \"i\".\n- In \"able\" there is 1 \"i\" but actually no.\n- In \"to\" there is no \"i\".\n- In \"make\" there is 1 \"i\".\n- In \"all\" there is no \"i\".\n- In \"the\" there are no \"i\"s but there are 2 \"the\"s, still no \"i\".\n- In \"seasons\" there is 1 \"i\" but actually no, I apologize there is no \"i\".\n- In \"same\" there is no \"i\".\n- In \"I\" there is 1 \"i\" but it is \"I\" which has 1 \"i\" and also it is uppercase.\n- In \"propose\" there is 1 \"i\" but actually no.\n\n## 4: List all words and check for \"i\"\nLet's list and check:\n1. are - no \"i\"\n2. able - no \"i\"\n3. to - no \"i\"\n4. make - 1 \"i\"\n5. all - no \"i\"\n6. the - no \"i\"\n7. seasons - no \"i\"\n8. the - no \"i\"\n9. same - no \"i\"\n10. I - 1 \"i\"\n11. propose - 1 \"i\"\n\n## 5: Count all the \"i\"s found\nThere is 1 \"i\" in \"make\", 1 \"i\" in \"I\", and 1 \"i\" in \"propose\". So in total, there are 3 \"i\"s but also we have \"same\" and actually no. So 1 (make) + 1 (I) + 1 (propose) = 3.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>3</answer>",
