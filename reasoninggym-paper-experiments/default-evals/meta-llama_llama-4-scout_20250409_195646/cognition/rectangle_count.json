However, for the purpose of counting rectangles, we will consider both '#' and '\u2588' as indicators of rectangle presence but focus on the structure they form.\n\n## 2: Identify the pattern of rectangles\nRectangles in this grid are formed by '#' characters. Single rectangles are clearly outlined by these characters, and there seems to be a larger rectangle formed by a series of '#' characters at the top and bottom of the grid, with a smaller rectangle inside.\n\n## 3: Count the large rectangle at the top and bottom\nThe large rectangle outlined by '#' at the top and bottom of the grid can be considered as one type of rectangle. There are two distinct large rectangles formed by the continuous '#' lines.\n\n## 4: Count the smaller rectangles inside\nInside the larger rectangle, there are smaller rectangles formed by '#' and possibly '\u2588' characters. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that '\u2588' is not present in the grid; instead, we see '#' outlining rectangles and no overlapping rectangles indicated by '\u2588'.\n\n## 5: Analyze the grid for rectangle counts\nLooking closely, there's a large rectangle that spans almost the entire width and height of the grid at the top and bottom, outlined by '#'. Inside this large rectangle, there are no '\u2588' characters indicating overlap but rather a series of '#' that could form smaller rectangles.\n\n## 6: Specific count of rectangles\n- The grid has a large rectangle at the top and bottom.\n- There's a smaller rectangle inside outlined by '#'.\n\n## 7: Detailed examination\nUpon a detailed examination, we see:\n- One large rectangle that spans the width of the grid at the top and bottom.\n- A set of nested rectangles formed by '#' characters.\n\n## 8: Calculation\nCounting each distinct rectangle:\n- The outer large rectangle.\n- The inner smaller rectangle.\n\n## 9: Conclusion\nThere are 2 large rectangles (top and bottom) and 1 smaller rectangle inside.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>3</answer>",

The task is to count the total number of rectangles present in this grid.\n\n## 2: Identify single and overlapping rectangles\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', and overlapping rectangles (up to 2) are shown with '\u2588'. This indicates that any '#' character could be part of a single rectangle, and any '\u2588' character could represent an overlap of two rectangles.\n\n## 3: Analyze the grid structure\nThe grid seems to have various sections, some of which contain '#' outlining single rectangles, and others contain '\u2588' for overlapping rectangles. There are also empty spaces without any specific characters.\n\n## 4: Develop a counting strategy\nTo count the rectangles, we need to identify and tally each distinct rectangle outlined by '#' or represented by '\u2588'. Given the complexity and size of the grid, a systematic approach would involve scanning the grid for '#' and '\u2588' patterns that form rectangles.\n\n## 5: Consider rectangle formation\nRectangles are formed by connected '#' characters or '\u2588' characters that create a closed shape. The task requires identifying these shapes and counting them.\n\n## 6: Account for overlapping rectangles\nOverlapping rectangles are indicated by '\u2588', which suggests that where '\u2588' appears, it could be part of two rectangles overlapping.\n\n## 7: Manual or visual inspection\nGiven the complexity of the grid and without a straightforward algorithmic approach provided, a visual or manual inspection seems necessary to accurately count each rectangle.\n\n## 8: Counting\nUpon inspecting the grid provided and considering the patterns of '#' and '\u2588', we notice that there are several distinct rectangles outlined by '#'. For '\u2588', it indicates overlapping sections.\n\n## 9: Calculation\nThe grid provided seems complex, with many '#' and '\u2588' characters. A precise count requires carefully tracing each rectangle.\n\n## 10: Conclusion\nAfter analyzing the grid and considering the presence of '#' for single rectangles and '\u2588' for overlaps, we proceed to count.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 36 </answer>",

There are two large rectangles outlined with '#' that can be easily identified:\n- One large rectangle with the dimensions of 12x8 (characters inside the '#').\n\n\n## 2: Count the Large Rectangle\nThe large rectangle is:\n```\n############################################\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n############################################\n```\nThis counts as 1 rectangle.\n\n\n## 3: Identify Overlapping Rectangles\nOverlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '\u2588'. However, upon inspecting the grid, there are no '\u2588' characters, which means there are no overlapping rectangles.\n\n\n## 4: Count Smaller Rectangles\nThere is a smaller grid that forms a rectangle:\n```\n####################\n#                  #\n#                  #\n#                  #\n#                  #\n####################\n```\nThis counts as 1 rectangle.\n\n\n## 5: Count the Nested Rectangles\nInside the smaller rectangle grid, there is another rectangle:\n```\n##############\n#            #\n#            #\n##############\n```\nThis counts as 1 rectangle.\n\n\n## 6: Calculate Total Rectangles\nAdding up all identified rectangles:\n- The large rectangle: 1\n- The smaller grid rectangle: 1\n- The nested rectangle: 1\n\n\n## 7: Provide the Final Count\nThe total count of rectangles is 3.\n\n\n<answer>3</answer>",

There are two large rectangles outlined with '#' that can be easily identified:\n- One large rectangle with the dimensions of 12x8 (characters inside the '#').\n\n\n## 2: Count the Large Rectangle\nThe large rectangle is:\n```\n############################################\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n#                                          #\n############################################\n```\nThis counts as 1 rectangle.\n\n\n## 3: Identify Overlapping Rectangles\nOverlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '\u2588'. However, upon inspecting the grid, there are no '\u2588' characters, which means there are no overlapping rectangles.\n\n\n## 4: Count Smaller Rectangles\nThere is a smaller grid that forms a rectangle:\n```\n####################\n#                  #\n#                  #\n#                  #\n#                  #\n####################\n```\nThis counts as 1 rectangle.\n\n\n## 5: Count the Nested Rectangles\nInside the smaller rectangle grid, there is another rectangle:\n```\n##############\n#            #\n#            #\n##############\n```\nThis counts as 1 rectangle.\n\n\n## 6: Calculate Total Rectangles\nAdding up all identified rectangles:\n- The large rectangle: 1\n- The smaller grid rectangle: 1\n- The nested rectangle: 1\n\n\n## 7: Provide the Final Count\nThe total count of rectangles is 3.\n\n\n<answer>3</answer>",

Rectangles are outlined with '#' for single rectangles and '\u2588' for overlapping rectangles (up to 2).\n\n## 2: Analyze the provided grid\nLooking at the grid provided, it seems mostly empty except for a specific section that contains '#' characters which likely form the rectangles.\n\n## 3: Identify potential rectangle formations\nThe section with '#' characters appears to form a rectangle or rectangles. We need to identify all '#' characters and determine how they form rectangles.\n\n## 4: Locate the '#' characters\nThe '#' characters are located in the following lines:\n- #########\n- #       #\n- #########\n\n## 5: Count the rectangles\nFrom the given section:\n- #########\n- #       #\n- #########\nThere is clearly one large rectangle formed by these '#' characters.\n\n## 6: Consider overlapping rectangles\nThere are no '\u2588' characters in the grid provided, which means there are no overlapping rectangles to consider.\n\n## 7: Conclusion\nBased on the pattern of '#' characters, there is only 1 rectangle visible in the grid.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Rectangles are outlined with '#' for single rectangles and '\u2588' for overlapping rectangles (up to 2).\n\n## 2: Analyze the provided grid\nLooking at the grid provided, it seems mostly empty except for a specific section that contains '#' characters which likely form the rectangles.\n\n## 3: Identify potential rectangle formations\nThe section with '#' characters appears to form a rectangle or rectangles. We need to identify all '#' characters and determine how they form rectangles.\n\n## 4: Locate the '#' characters\nThe '#' characters are located in the following lines:\n- #########\n- #       #\n- #########\n\n## 5: Count the rectangles\nFrom the given section:\n- #########\n- #       #\n- #########\nThere is clearly one large rectangle formed by these '#' characters.\n\n## 6: Consider overlapping rectangles\nThere are no '\u2588' characters in the grid provided, which means there are no overlapping rectangles to consider.\n\n## 7: Conclusion\nBased on the pattern of '#' characters, there is only 1 rectangle visible in the grid.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Single rectangles are outlined with a '#', and overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '\u2588'. However, given the grid provided, it seems that only '#' and no '\u2588' characters are used to represent the rectangles.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the patterns for rectangles\nIn the grid, single rectangles are outlined by '#' characters. This means any '#' character that is part of a rectangle's outline should be counted.\n\n## 2: Analyze the grid for rectangle patterns\nLooking at the grid, there are two distinct sets of rectangle patterns:\n1. A series of '#' characters forming a grid that outlines rectangles.\n2. A larger rectangle formed by '#' characters.\n\n## 3: Count the rectangles in the first pattern\nThe first pattern consists of multiple '#' characters lined up in a grid pattern:\n```\n###  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n### \n```\nThis pattern seems to represent multiple small rectangles stacked vertically.\n\n## 4: Count the rectangles in the second pattern\nThe second pattern is a larger rectangle:\n```\n#################     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n################# \n```\n\n## 5: Calculate the total count of rectangles\nFor the first pattern, there are 21 rows of '#' characters with 3 '#' characters in each row that could potentially form vertical lines of rectangles, but upon closer inspection, it seems that there are 21 rectangles here because each pair of '#' (except for the very top and bottom) forms a side of a rectangle with the ones above and below it, and there are 21 such pairs.\n\nFor the second pattern, there is clearly 1 large rectangle.\n\n## 6: Combine counts for a final total\nThe first pattern clearly outlines 21 rectangles (as there are 21 '#' lines that could act as a side, making 21 small rectangles). \nThe second pattern outlines 1 large rectangle.\n\n## 7: Provide the final count\nAdding these counts together gives a total.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>23</answer>",

A larger rectangle formed by '#' characters.\n\n## 3: Count the rectangles in the first pattern\nThe first pattern consists of multiple '#' characters lined up in a grid pattern:\n```\n###  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n# #  \n### \n```\nThis pattern seems to represent multiple small rectangles stacked vertically.\n\n## 4: Count the rectangles in the second pattern\nThe second pattern is a larger rectangle:\n```\n#################     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n#               #     \n################# \n```\n\n## 5: Calculate the total count of rectangles\nFor the first pattern, there are 21 rows of '#' characters with 3 '#' characters in each row that could potentially form vertical lines of rectangles, but upon closer inspection, it seems that there are 21 rectangles here because each pair of '#' (except for the very top and bottom) forms a side of a rectangle with the ones above and below it, and there are 21 such pairs.\n\nFor the second pattern, there is clearly 1 large rectangle.\n\n## 6: Combine counts for a final total\nThe first pattern clearly outlines 21 rectangles (as there are 21 '#' lines that could act as a side, making 21 small rectangles). \nThe second pattern outlines 1 large rectangle.\n\n## 7: Provide the final count\nAdding these counts together gives a total.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>23</answer>",
