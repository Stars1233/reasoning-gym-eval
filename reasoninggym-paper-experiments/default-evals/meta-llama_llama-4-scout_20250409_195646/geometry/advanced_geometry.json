Let's denote the sides opposite to vertices A, B, and C as a, b, and c respectively.\n\n## 2: Apply the distance formula to find the length of side a (opposite to vertex A)\nThe length of side a can be found using the coordinates of B and C: \\(a = \\sqrt{(7 - 9)^2 + (-10 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-12)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 144} = \\sqrt{148}\\).\n\n## 3: Apply the distance formula to find the length of side b (opposite to vertex B)\nThe length of side b can be found using the coordinates of A and C: \\(b = \\sqrt{(7 - (-7))^2 + (-10 - 10)^2} = \\sqrt{(14)^2 + (-20)^2} = \\sqrt{196 + 400} = \\sqrt{596}\\).\n\n## 4: Apply the distance formula to find the length of side c (opposite to vertex C)\nThe length of side c can be found using the coordinates of A and B: \\(c = \\sqrt{(9 - (-7))^2 + (2 - 10)^2} = \\sqrt{(16)^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{256 + 64} = \\sqrt{320}\\).\n\n## 5: Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle\nThe semi-perimeter (s) is given by \\(s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2}\\). Let's compute the values of a, b, and c: \\(a = \\sqrt{148} \\approx 12.165\\), \\(b = \\sqrt{596} \\approx 24.416\\), and \\(c = \\sqrt{320} \\approx 17.888\\).

The altitudes of a triangle are lines from the vertices perpendicular to the opposite sides. We start by finding the slopes of the sides of the triangle. The slope \\(m\\) of a line passing through points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by \\(m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\).\n\n## 2: Calculate the slopes of the sides of the triangle\n- Slope of side AB: \\(m_{AB} = \\frac{3 - 3}{4 - (-7)} = \\frac{0}{11} = 0\\)\n- Slope of side BC: \\(m_{BC} = \\frac{9 - 3}{-2 - 4} = \\frac{6}{-6} = -1\\)\n- Slope of side AC: \\(m_{AC} = \\frac{9 - 3}{-2 - (-7)} = \\frac{6}{5}\\)\n\n## 3: Find the equations of the altitudes\nThe altitude from a vertex is perpendicular to the opposite side. Thus, the slope of the altitude from vertex A to side BC is the negative reciprocal of \\(m_{BC}\\), from vertex B to side AC is the negative reciprocal of \\(m_{AC}\\), and from vertex C to side AB is the negative reciprocal of \\(m_{AB}\\).\n\n- Slope of altitude from A to BC: Since \\(m_{BC} = -1\\), the slope of the altitude from A is 1.\n- Slope of altitude from B to AC: Since \\(m_{AC} = \\frac{6}{5}\\), the slope of the altitude from B is \\(-\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n- Slope of altitude from C to AB: Since \\(m_{AB} = 0\\), the slope of the altitude from C is undefined (it's a vertical line).\n\n## 4: Equation of the altitude from vertex A to BC\nUsing point-slope form \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), with \\(m = 1\\) and point A(-7, 3):\n\\(y - 3 = 1(x - (-7))\\)\n\\(y - 3 = x + 7\\)\n\\(y = x + 10\\)\n\n## 5: Equation of the altitude from vertex B to AC\nWith \\(m = -\\frac{5}{6}\\) and point B(4, 3):\n\\(y - 3 = -\\frac{5}{6}(x - 4)\\)\n\\(y - 3 = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{20}{6}\\)\n\\(y = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{20}{6} + 3\\)\n\\(y = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{20}{6} + \\frac{18}{6}\\)\n\\(y = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{38}{6}\\)\n\\(y = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{19}{3}\\)\n\n## 6: Equation of the altitude from vertex C to AB\nSince the slope is undefined (vertical line) and it passes through C(-2, 9), the equation is simply \\(x = -2\\).\n\n## 7: Find the intersection of two altitudes to locate the orthocenter\nWe can find the intersection of the altitude from A and the altitude from C (which is a vertical line \\(x = -2\\)), and then verify with another.\n\n## 8: Intersection of \\(y = x + 10\\) and \\(x = -2\\)\nSubstitute \\(x = -2\\) into \\(y = x + 10\\):\n\\(y = -2 + 10 = 8\\)\nSo, one intersection is \\((-2, 8)\\).\n\n## 9: Verify with another altitude\nLet's find the intersection of \\(y = x + 10\\) and \\(y = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{19}{3}\\):\n\\(x + 10 = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{19}{3}\\)\nMultiplying everything by 6 to clear denominators:\n\\(6x + 60 = -5x + 38\\)\n\\(11x = -22\\)\n\\(x = -2\\)\nSubstitute \\(x = -2\\) into one of the equations, \\(y = -2 + 10 = 8\\).\nSo, the orthocenter is indeed at \\((-2, 8)\\).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>(-2, 8)</answer>",
