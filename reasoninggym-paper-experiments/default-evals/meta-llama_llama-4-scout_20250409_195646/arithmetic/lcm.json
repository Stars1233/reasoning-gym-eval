However, 54 is odd, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since 54 = 3 * 18, and 18 = 3 * 6, and 6 = 2 * 3, we have 54 = 2 * 3^3.\n\n## 2: Find the prime factorization of 63\nFor 63, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 3 (since 63 is odd and not divisible by 2). We find that 63 = 3 * 21, and 21 = 3 * 7, so 63 = 3^2 * 7.\n\n## 3: Identify the highest power of each prime factor\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations of the given numbers. From 54, we have 2^1 and 3^3. From 63, we have 3^2 and 7^1.\n\n## 4: Determine the LCM\nThe prime factors and their highest powers are: 2^1 (from 54), 3^3 (from 54, since it's higher than 3^2 from 63), and 7^1 (from 63). So, the LCM = 2^1 * 3^3 * 7^1 = 2 * 27 * 7.\n\n## 5: Calculate the LCM\nCalculating the LCM: 2 * 27 * 7 = 2 * 189 = 378.\n\n<answer>378</answer>",
