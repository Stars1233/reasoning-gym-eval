So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 3/4.\n\n## 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row.\nThe odd numbers on a 4-sided die are 1 and 3. This means there are 2 odd numbers out of 4 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an odd number is 2/4 = 1/2. Since Joseph needs to roll two odd numbers in a row, we square the probability of rolling one odd number: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\n## 3: Find the difference in probability between the two events.\nTo find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 1 than to roll two odd numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 1: 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2.\n\n## 4: Express the difference as a percentage.\nTo express this difference as a percentage, we take the difference (1/2) and convert it into a percentage: (1/2) * 100 = 50.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>50</answer>",

The comet was seen by his uncle 55 years before Michael saw it for the second time. So, when Michael's uncle saw the comet, Michael was \\(96 - 55 = 41\\) years old.\n\n## 5: Verify the information given and conclude.\nGiven that we now understand the timeline, let's verify: Michael's uncle was 24 when he saw the comet. Michael saw the comet for the second time at 96. The difference in their ages when they saw the comet is \\(96 - 24 = 72\\) years. However, we need to calculate Michael's age when he first saw the comet.\n\n## 6: Calculate Michael's age when he first saw the comet.\nSince the comet appears every 55 years, and Michael saw it for the second time at 96, we subtract 55 from 96 to find his age when he first saw it: \\(96 - 55 = 41\\).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>41</answer>",
