          "full_model_response": "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Analyze the constraints:** We have 7 statements, and we need to determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. The statements themselves provide constraints on the number of true and false statements.\n\n2. **Consider Statement 1 and Statement 2:**\n   - Statement 1: At least 4 true statements. This means the number of true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n   - Statement 2: At most 1 false statement. This means the number of false statements can be 0 or 1.  This is equivalent to saying there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n   Combining these, the only possible number of true statements is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Consider Statement 3 and Statement 4:**\n   - Statement 3: Exactly 4 true statements.\n   - Statement 4: Exactly 3 false statements (which means 4 true statements).\n   Statements 3 and 4 are equivalent.\n\n4. **Consider Statement 5:**\n   - Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n   Since Statements 3 and 4 are equivalent, this statement implies that exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n5. **Combining the information:**\n   From steps 2 and 4, we have conflicting information. We previously determined the number of true statements must be 6 or 7, but Statement 5 forces it to be 4. Therefore, we need to explore the consequences of each possibility.\n\n6. **Case 1: Assume Statement 5 is true (4 true statements).**\n   - If 4 statements are true, then 3 are false.\n   - Statement 1: At least 4 true - TRUE\n   - Statement 2: At most 1 false - FALSE (3 false statements)\n   - Statement 3: Exactly 4 true - TRUE\n   - Statement 4: Exactly 3 false - TRUE\n   - Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both - FALSE (both are true)\n   - Statement 6: The number of true statements is a prime number - TRUE (4 is not prime)\n   - Statement 7: The number of false statements is a composite number - TRUE (3 is not composite)\n   This case leads to a contradiction because Statement 5 is false.\n\n7. **Case 2: Assume Statement 5 is false (not exactly 4 true statements).**\n   - This means the number of true statements is not 4.\n   - From steps 2, the number of true statements must be 6 or 7.\n\n   * **Subcase 2.1: 6 true statements, 1 false statement.**\n     - Statement 1: At least 4 true - TRUE\n     - Statement 2: At most 1 false - TRUE\n     - Statement 3: Exactly 4 true - FALSE\n     - Statement 4: Exactly 3 false - FALSE\n     - Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both - TRUE\n     - Statement 6: The number of true statements is a prime number - TRUE (6 is not prime)\n     - Statement 7: The number of false statements is a composite number - FALSE (1 is not composite)\n     This subcase leads to a contradiction because Statement 7 is false.\n\n   * **Subcase 2.2: 7 true statements, 0 false statements.**\n     - Statement 1: At least 4 true - TRUE\n     - Statement 2: At most 1 false - TRUE\n     - Statement 3: Exactly 4 true - FALSE\n     - Statement 4: Exactly 3 false - FALSE\n     - Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both - TRUE\n     - Statement 6: The number of true statements is a prime number - FALSE (7 is prime)\n     - Statement 7: The number of false statements is a composite number - FALSE (0 is not composite)\n     This subcase leads to a contradiction because Statement 6 and Statement 7 are false.\n\n8. **Re-evaluate Statement 6 and 7:**\n   Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime, and Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite.\n\n9. **Consider the possible number of true statements and their implications:**\n    - If 5 statements are true (2 false):\n        - Statement 1: True\n        - Statement 2: False\n        - Statement 3: False\n        - Statement 4: False\n        - Statement 5: True\n        - Statement 6: True (5 is prime)\n        - Statement 7: False (2 is prime)\n    - If 6 statements are true (1 false):\n        - Statement 1: True\n        - Statement 2: True\n        - Statement 3: False\n        - Statement 4: False\n        - Statement 5: True\n        - Statement 6: False (6 is not prime)\n        - Statement 7: False (1 is not composite)\n    - If 7 statements are true (0 false):\n        - Statement 1: True\n        - Statement 2: True\n        - Statement 3: False\n        - Statement 4: False\n        - Statement 5: True\n        - Statement 6: False (7 is prime)\n        - Statement 7: False (0 is not composite)\n\n10. **Final Analysis:** None of the scenarios lead to all statements being true.

          "full_model_response": "Here's how we can approach this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Analyze the statements:** We have 7 statements about the truthfulness of the statements themselves. This is a classic logic puzzle. We need to find how many ways we can assign truth values (True or False) to these statements such that all the statements hold true.\n\n2. **Consider Statement 3 and Statement 4:** These statements are mutually exclusive (exactly 7 true vs. exactly 2 false).  If Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false, meaning 5 are true.\n\n3. **Analyze Statement 5:** Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This is crucial.\n\n4. **Case 1: Statement 3 is True:** If Statement 3 is true, all 7 statements are true. Let's check if this is consistent:\n   - Statement 1: At least 3 true - True (since all 7 are true)\n   - Statement 2: At most 3 false - True (since 0 are false)\n   - Statement 3: Exactly 7 true - True (by assumption)\n   - Statement 4: Exactly 2 false - False\n   - Statement 5: Either 3 or 4 is true, but not both - False (since 3 is true and 4 is false)\n   - Statement 6: Number of true is prime - True (7 is prime)\n   - Statement 7: Number of false is composite - False (0 is not composite)\n   This case is inconsistent because Statements 4, 5, and 7 are false when we assume Statement 3 is true.\n\n5. **Case 2: Statement 4 is True:** If Statement 4 is true, there are exactly 2 false statements and 5 true statements.

This means there are exactly 1 false statement.\n   - Statement 1: 'At least 3 are true' \u2013 True (since 6 are true)\n   - Statement 2: 'At most 1 is false' \u2013 True (since 1 is false)\n   - Statement 3: 'Exactly 6 are true' \u2013 True (by assumption)\n   - Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 are false' \u2013 False\n   - Statement 5: 'Either 3 or 4 is true, but not both' \u2013 True (Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false)\n   - Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is prime' \u2013 True (6 is not prime, so this is false)\n   - Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is composite' \u2013 False (1 is not composite)\n   In this case, we have 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which contradicts the initial assumption of 6 true statements. So, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n3. **Consider Statement 4 being true:** If Statement 4 is true (exactly 2 statements are false), then Statement 3 must be false. This means there are exactly 5 true statements.\n   - Statement 1: 'At least 3 are true' \u2013 True (since 5 are true)\n   - Statement 2: 'At most 1 is false' \u2013 False (since 2 are false)\n   - Statement 3: 'Exactly 6 are true' \u2013 False\n   - Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 are false' \u2013 True (by assumption)\n   - Statement 5: 'Either 3 or 4 is true, but not both' \u2013 True (Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false)\n   - Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is prime' \u2013 True (5 is prime)\n   - Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is composite' \u2013 False (2 is not composite)\n   In this case, we have 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which contradicts the initial assumption of 5 true statements.

Let's consider the number of true statements as 'T' and false statements as 'F'. We know T + F = 7.\n\n5. **Analyze Statement 2:** \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\" This implies F <= 1, meaning T >= 6.\n\n6. **Analyze Statement 1:** \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\" This implies T >= 3.\n\n7. **Combine Statements 1 & 2:** Since F <= 1, T must be either 6 or 7.\n\n8. **Case 1: T = 6, F = 1**\n   - Statement 1: True\n   - Statement 2: True\n   - Statement 3: True\n   - Statement 4: False\n   - Statement 5: True\n   - Statement 6: False (6 is not prime)\n   - Statement 7: False (1 is not composite)\n   Total True: 4.

This contradicts T=7.\n\n10. **Re-examine Statement 7:** The number of false statements is composite. Composite numbers are greater than 1 and not prime.\n\n11. **Let's revisit the assumption of 5 true statements and 2 false statements**\n   - Statement 1: True\n   - Statement 2: False\n   - Statement 3: False\n   - Statement 4: True\n   - Statement 5: True\n   - Statement 6: True\n   - Statement 7: False\n   Total True: 4. This contradicts our assumption of 5 true statements.\n\n12. **Let's try to find a solution where the number of true statements is 5 and the number of false statements is 2.**\n   - Statement 1: True (at least 3 true)\n   - Statement 2: False (at most 1 false)\n   - Statement 3: False (exactly 6 true)\n   - Statement 4: True (exactly 2 false)\n   - Statement 5: True (either 3 or 4 true, but not both)\n   - Statement 6: True (5 is prime)\n   - Statement 7: False (2 is not composite)\n   This yields 4 true statements, which is a contradiction.\n\n13. **Let's consider the possibility of 4 true statements and 3 false statements.**\n   - Statement 1: True\n   - Statement 2: False\n   - Statement 3: False\n   - Statement 4: False\n   - Statement 5: False\n   - Statement 6: False\n   - Statement 7: False\n   Total True: 1.

This is impossible as we've already shown.\n\n13. **Examine the possibility of exactly two true statements.** Statement 1 says at least two are true. If exactly two are true, Statement 2 is false. If Statement 2 is false, there is at least one false statement. This is consistent.\n\n14. **Consider the case where Statement 1 and Statement 6 are true:** This means at least two statements are true, and the number of true statements is prime. The possible number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n    - If 2 statements are true: Statement 6 is true.\n    - If 3 statements are true: Statement 6 is true.\n    - If 5 statements are true: Statement 6 is true.\n    - If 7 statements are true: Statement 6 is true.\n\n15. **Consider the case where 7 statements are true:** We already determined this is impossible.\n\n16. **Consider the case where 5 statements are true:**\n    - Statement 1: True\n    - Statement 2: False\n    - Statement 3: False\n    - Statement 4: False\n    - Statement 5: False\n    - Statement 6: True\n    - Statement 7: False\n    This is a possible solution.\n\n17. **Consider the case where 3 statements are true:**\n    - Statement 1: True\n    - Statement 2: False\n    - Statement 3: False\n    - Statement 4: False\n    - Statement 5: False\n    - Statement 6: True\n    - Statement 7: False\n    This is a possible solution.\n\n18. **Consider the case where 2 statements are true:**\n    - Statement 1: True\n    - Statement 2: False\n    - Statement 3: False\n    - Statement 4: False\n    - Statement 5: False\n    - Statement 6: True\n    - Statement 7: False\n    This is a possible solution.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible solutions.\n\n<answer>0</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Analyze Statements 1 and 2:**\n   - Statement 1 says at least 4 are true. This means the number of true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n   - Statement 2 says at most 7 are false. This means the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since there are 7 statements total, this is always true if the number of true statements is between 0 and 7. So, statement 2 doesn't give us any new information.\n\n2. **Analyze Statements 3 and 4:**\n   - Statement 3 says exactly 4 are true.\n   - Statement 4 says exactly 3 are false, which means exactly 4 are true.\n\n3. **Analyze Statement 5:**\n   - Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since statements 3 and 4 both say exactly 4 statements are true, they are logically equivalent. Therefore, statement 5 is false.\n\n4. **Consider the implications of Statement 5 being false:**\n   - Since statement 5 is false, it means either both statements 3 and 4 are true, or both are false. However, statements 3 and 4 are logically equivalent, so they must both be true or both be false.\n\n5. **Case 1: Statements 3 and 4 are true.**\n   - If statements 3 and 4 are true, then exactly 4 statements are true.\n   - Statement 1 says at least 4 are true. This is consistent with 4 being true.\n   - Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. 4 is not a prime number, so statement 6 is false.\n   - Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. There are 3 false statements, and 3 is a prime number, so statement 7 is false.\n   - In this case, the true statements are 3 and 4. Since statement 1 is also true, there are 3 true statements. This contradicts our initial assumption that exactly 4 statements are true. Thus, this case is impossible.\n\n6. **Case 2: Statements 3 and 4 are false.**\n   - If statements 3 and 4 are false, then it is not the case that exactly 4 statements are true.\n   - Statement 1 says at least 4 are true. Let's consider the possibilities.\n   - Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers between 4 and 7 are 5 and 7.\n   - Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. The composite numbers between 0 and 3 are 1, 4.\n   - Let's analyze the possibilities:\n      - If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements. 2 is prime, and 2 is not composite. So statement 7 is false. Statement 6 is true.\n      - If there are 6 true statements, then there is 1 false statement. 1 is not composite. So statement 7 is false. Statement 6 is true.\n      - If there are 7 true statements, then there are 0 false statements. 0 is not composite. So statement 7 is false. Statement 6 is true.\n   - Let's look at the true statements:\n      - If 5 true: 1, 6.\n      - If 6 true: 1, 6.\n      - If 7 true: 1, 6.\n   - Since statements 3 and 4 are false, statement 5 is false.\n   - If there are 5 true statements, the true statements are 1, 6, and possibly others. Since statement 1 is true (at least 4 are true), statement 2 is true (at most 7 are false), statement 3 is false, statement 4 is false, statement 5 is false, statement 6 is true, and statement 7 is false, the true statements are 1, 6.\n   - If there are 6 true statements, the true statements are 1, 6.\n   - If there are 7 true statements, the true statements are 1, 6.\n   - In all cases, statement 1 is true, statement 6 is true, and statements 3, 4, 5, and 7 are false.\n   - If the number of true statements is 5, then the number of false statements is 2, which is prime, so statement 7 is false.\n   - If the number of true statements is 6, then the number of false statements is 1, which is not composite, so statement 7 is false.\n   - If the number of true statements is 7, then the number of false statements is 0, which is not composite, so statement 7 is false.\n\n7. **Final Assessment**\n   - Only the case where statements 3 and 4 are false is possible.\n   - The number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n   - The number of false statements is 2, 1, or 0 respectively.\n   - In each of these cases, statements 1 and 6 are true, while statements 3, 4, 5, and 7 are false.\n\n<answer>3</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Analyze Statements 1 and 2:**\n   - Statement 1 says at least 4 are true. This means the number of true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n   - Statement 2 says at most 7 are false. This means the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since there are 7 statements total, this is always true if the number of true statements is between 0 and 7. So, statement 2 doesn't give us any new information.\n\n2. **Analyze Statements 3 and 4:**\n   - Statement 3 says exactly 4 are true.\n   - Statement 4 says exactly 3 are false, which means exactly 4 are true.\n\n3. **Analyze Statement 5:**\n   - Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since statements 3 and 4 both say exactly 4 statements are true, they are logically equivalent. Therefore, statement 5 is false.\n\n4. **Consider the implications of Statement 5 being false:**\n   - Since statement 5 is false, it means either both statements 3 and 4 are true, or both are false. However, statements 3 and 4 are logically equivalent, so they must both be true or both be false.\n\n5. **Case 1: Statements 3 and 4 are true.**\n   - If statements 3 and 4 are true, then exactly 4 statements are true.\n   - Statement 1 says at least 4 are true. This is consistent with 4 being true.\n   - Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. 4 is not a prime number, so statement 6 is false.\n   - Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. There are 3 false statements, and 3 is a prime number, so statement 7 is false.\n   - In this case, the true statements are 3 and 4. Since statement 1 is also true, there are 3 true statements. This contradicts our initial assumption that exactly 4 statements are true. Thus, this case is impossible.\n\n6. **Case 2: Statements 3 and 4 are false.**\n   - If statements 3 and 4 are false, then it is not the case that exactly 4 statements are true.\n   - Statement 1 says at least 4 are true. Let's consider the possibilities.\n   - Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers between 4 and 7 are 5 and 7.\n   - Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. The composite numbers between 0 and 3 are 1, 4.\n   - Let's analyze the possibilities:\n      - If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements. 2 is prime, and 2 is not composite. So statement 7 is false. Statement 6 is true.\n      - If there are 6 true statements, then there is 1 false statement. 1 is not composite. So statement 7 is false. Statement 6 is true.\n      - If there are 7 true statements, then there are 0 false statements. 0 is not composite. So statement 7 is false. Statement 6 is true.\n   - Let's look at the true statements:\n      - If 5 true: 1, 6.\n      - If 6 true: 1, 6.\n      - If 7 true: 1, 6.\n   - Since statements 3 and 4 are false, statement 5 is false.\n   - If there are 5 true statements, the true statements are 1, 6, and possibly others. Since statement 1 is true (at least 4 are true), statement 2 is true (at most 7 are false), statement 3 is false, statement 4 is false, statement 5 is false, statement 6 is true, and statement 7 is false, the true statements are 1, 6.\n   - If there are 6 true statements, the true statements are 1, 6.\n   - If there are 7 true statements, the true statements are 1, 6.\n   - In all cases, statement 1 is true, statement 6 is true, and statements 3, 4, 5, and 7 are false.\n   - If the number of true statements is 5, then the number of false statements is 2, which is prime, so statement 7 is false.\n   - If the number of true statements is 6, then the number of false statements is 1, which is not composite, so statement 7 is false.\n   - If the number of true statements is 7, then the number of false statements is 0, which is not composite, so statement 7 is false.\n\n7. **Final Assessment**\n   - Only the case where statements 3 and 4 are false is possible.\n   - The number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n   - The number of false statements is 2, 1, or 0 respectively.\n   - In each of these cases, statements 1 and 6 are true, while statements 3, 4, 5, and 7 are false.\n\n<answer>3</answer>",

This means there are either more or fewer than 3 false statements. But since Statement 3 is true, there are 4 true statements and therefore 3 false statements. This is a contradiction. So, this case is impossible.\n\n11. **Case 2: Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is true.**\n    - If Statement 4 is true, there are exactly 3 false statements, meaning 4 true statements.\n    - Since Statement 3 is false, there are *not* exactly 4 true statements. This is consistent with 4 true statements.\n    - Now, let's check other statements:\n        - Statement 1: \"At least 1 is true\" - True (we have 4 true statements).\n        - Statement 2: \"At most 3 are false\" - True (we have 3 false statements).\n        - Statement 3: \"Exactly 4 are true\" - False (as assumed).\n        - Statement 4: \"Exactly 3 are false\" - True (as assumed).\n        - Statement 5: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\" - True (Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false).\n        - Statement 6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number\" - True (4 is not prime, so this statement is false).\n        - Statement 7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number\" - True (3 is not composite, so this statement is false).\n\n12. **Re-evaluate Case 2:** In Case 2, we have 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n    - Statement 1 is True.\n    - Statement 2 is True.\n    - Statement 3 is False.\n    - Statement 4 is True.\n    - Statement 5 is True.\n    - Statement 6 is False (4 is not prime).\n    - Statement 7 is False (3 is not composite).\n\nThis gives us a total of 3 true statements and 4 false statements, which contradicts our initial assumption of 4 true and 3 false.\n\n13. **Let's consider the number of true statements being 5.**\n    - If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements.\n    - Statement 1: True\n    - Statement 2: True\n    - Statement 3: False\n    - Statement 4: False\n    - Statement 5: True\n    - Statement 6: True (5 is prime)\n    - Statement 7: False (2 is not composite)\n    Total True: 4. Contradiction.\n\n14. **Let's consider the number of true statements being 7.**\n    - If there are 7 true statements, then there are 0 false statements.\n    - Statement 1: True\n    - Statement 2: True\n    - Statement 3: True\n    - Statement 4: False\n    - Statement 5: True\n    - Statement 6: True (7 is prime)\n    - Statement 7: False (0 is not composite)\n    Total True: 6. Contradiction.\n\n15. **Let's re-examine the initial assumptions.**\nIf Statement 4 is true, we have 3 false and 4 true statements.\n- Statement 1 is true\n- Statement 2 is true\n- Statement 3 is false\n- Statement 4 is true\n- Statement 5 is true\n- Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime)\n- Statement 7 is false (3 is not composite)\nThis gives 4 true statements, which is consistent with Statement 4 being true.\n\nHowever, we also need to ensure the number of true statements matches the truth value of Statement 6.\n\nSince we found one solution where statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are true, and statements 3, 6, and 7 are false, let's verify:\n\n- 4 true statements\n- 3 false statements\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: False (4 is not prime)\n- Statement 7: False (3 is not composite)\n\nThis configuration works. Therefore, there is 1 possible solution.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n4. **Consider the case where Statement 4 is true:** If Statement 4 is true (\"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false\"), then 4 statements are true.\n\n5. **Check for consistency with Statement 1:** If 4 statements are true, Statement 1 (\"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true\") is true.\n\n6. **Check for consistency with Statement 2:** If 3 statements are false, Statement 2 (\"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false\") is true.\n\n7. **Check for consistency with Statement 5:** Since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 (\"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\") is true.\n\n8. **Check for consistency with Statement 6:** If 4 statements are true, Statement 6 (\"The number of true statements is a prime number\") is true (4 is not a prime number, so this is false). This means that our assumption that Statement 4 is true is incorrect.\n\n9. **Revisit the analysis with Statement 4 being false:** If Statement 4 is false, then it is *not* the case that exactly 3 statements are false. This means the number of false statements is not 3. Since Statement 5 is true, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n10. **Consider the number of true statements:** Let 't' be the number of true statements and 'f' be the number of false statements. We know t + f = 7. Statement 1 says t >= 4. Statement 2 says f <= 5. Since f = 7 - t, this is equivalent to 7 - t <= 5, or t >= 2. Combining these, we have t >= 4.\n\n11. **Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7:** Statement 6 says 't' is a prime number. Statement 7 says 'f' is a composite number. Since t >= 4, possible values for t are 5 and 7 (prime numbers).\n    * If t = 5, then f = 2, which is a prime number (not composite). This contradicts Statement 7.\n    * If t = 7, then f = 0, which is neither prime nor composite. This contradicts Statement 7.\n\n12. **Re-examine Statement 1 and Statement 2:** We have t >= 4 and f <= 5.\n    * If t = 4, f = 3. Statement 6: 4 is not prime. Statement 7: 3 is prime. This doesn't work.\n    * If t = 5, f = 2. Statement 6: 5 is prime. Statement 7: 2 is prime. This doesn't work.\n    * If t = 6, f = 1. Statement 6: 6 is not prime. Statement 7: 1 is neither prime nor composite. This doesn't work.\n    * If t = 7, f = 0. Statement 6: 7 is prime. Statement 7: 0 is neither prime nor composite. This doesn't work.\n\n13. **Consider the possibility that the statements themselves are part of the count:** Let's denote the statements as S1, S2, ..., S7.\n    * We know Statement 5 is true.\n    * If Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are true. This includes S1, S2, S4, S5.\n    * If Statement 3 is true, then 0 statements are true. This is a contradiction.\n\nLet's try a different approach. We know Statement 5 is true, so exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. We already ruled out Statement 3. So Statement 4 must be true. This means exactly 3 statements are false, and 4 statements are true.\nThe true statements are S1, S2, S4, S5.\nS1: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\" - True (4 are true)\nS2: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\" - True (3 are false)\nS3: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\" - False\nS4: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" - True\nS5: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\" - True\nS6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\" - False (4 is not prime)\nS7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\" - False (3 is prime)\n\nHowever, this creates a contradiction since S6 and S7 are both false.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. We have t >= 4 and f <= 5. Statement 5 tells us exactly one of S3 or S4 is true.\nIf S4 is true, t = 4, f = 3. S6 and S7 are false.\nIf S3 is true, t = 0, f = 7. This contradicts S1.\n\nLet's analyze the situation where S1, S2, S5 are true.\nIf t = 4, f = 3. Then S6 is false, S7 is false.\nIf t = 5, f = 2. Then S6 is true, S7 is false.\nIf t = 6, f = 1.

Therefore, Statement 4 (exactly 1 false/6 true) *must* be true.\n\n5. **Evaluate Statement 4's Truthfulness:**\n   - Since Statement 4 is true, there are exactly 6 true statements and 1 false statement.\n\n6. **Check Statement 1:**\n   - Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'  Since 6 are true, this statement is true.\n\n7. **Check Statement 2:**\n   - Statement 2: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' Since 1 is false, this statement is true.\n\n8. **Check Statement 3:**\n   - Statement 3: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' This is false (we know 6 are true).\n\n9. **Check Statement 4:**\n   - Statement 4: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This is true (as established).\n\n10. **Check Statement 5:**\n    - Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, this statement is true.\n\n11. **Check Statement 6:**\n    - Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The number of true statements is 6, which is not a prime number. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n12. **Check Statement 7:**\n    - Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The number of false statements is 1, which is neither prime nor composite. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n13. **Count True Statements:**\n    - Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are true. Statements 3, 6, and 7 are false.  This confirms we have 6 true statements and 1 false statement.\n\n14. **Determine the Number of Possible Solutions:**\n    - We have found one consistent assignment of truth values to the statements.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This means Statement 4 is false (since it says exactly 3 are false). Statement 5 is true (since only Statement 3 is true).  Statement 6 is true (6 is not prime, so this is a contradiction).

Statement 5 is true (since only Statement 4 is true). Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime). Statement 7 is true (3 is not composite, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n* **Revisiting the initial assumption:** Since both cases where either Statement 3 or Statement 4 are true lead to contradictions, Statement 5 must be false.

          "full_model_response": "Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle step-by-step:\n\n1. **Analyze Statement 1 & 2:**\n   - Statement 1 says at least 6 are true, meaning 6 or 7 are true. This implies at most 1 or 0 are false.\n   - Statement 2 says at most 5 are false, meaning 2 or more are true.\n   - These two statements are compatible.\n\n2. **Analyze Statement 3 & 4:**\n   - Statement 3 says exactly 3 are true.\n   - Statement 4 says exactly 1 is false (which means 6 are true).\n   - These two statements are mutually exclusive.\n\n3. **Analyze Statement 5:**\n   - Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This reinforces the exclusivity of Statements 3 and 4.\n\n4. **Consider the case where Statement 3 is true:**\n   - If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true.\n   - Statement 1 (at least 6 true) is false.\n   - Statement 4 (exactly 1 false) is false.\n   - Statement 5 (either 3 or 4 true, but not both) is true.\n   - This gives us 3 true statements and 4 false statements.\n   - Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) is false (3 is prime, but we're assuming Statement 3 is true, so it must be consistent).\n   - Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) is true (4 is composite).\n   - So, in this case, Statements 3, 5, and 7 are true, and Statements 1, 2, 4, and 6 are false. This means 3 statements are true, which is consistent with our assumption that Statement 3 is true.\n\n5. **Consider the case where Statement 4 is true:**\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true.\n   - Statement 1 (at least 6 true) is true.\n   - Statement 3 (exactly 3 true) is false.\n   - Statement 5 (either 3 or 4 true, but not both) is true.\n   - This gives us 6 true statements and 1 false statement.\n   - Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) is true (6 is not prime, so this is false).\n   - Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) is false (1 is neither prime nor composite).\n   - So, in this case, Statements 1, 4, and 5 are true, and Statements 2, 3, 6, and 7 are false. This means 6 statements are true, which is consistent with our assumption that Statement 4 is true.\n\n6. **Check for consistency:**\n   - Case 1 (Statement 3 is true): Statements 3, 5, 7 are true. Statements 1, 2, 4, 6 are false. This gives 3 true statements and 4 false statements.\n   - Case 2 (Statement 4 is true): Statements 1, 4, 5 are true. Statements 2, 3, 6, 7 are false.

Therefore, both statements must either be true or false together.\n\n2. **Analyze Statements 3 & 4:** These statements are mutually exclusive.

Statement 7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\" (True, since 3 is prime, this is false).\n   - This case is inconsistent because statement 6 and 7 are false.\n\n8. **Case 2: Statement 4 is True:**\n   - If Statement 4 is true (exactly 3 false), then Statement 3 is false (not exactly 4 true).\n   - Statement 1 is true (at least 4 true, since 4 are true).\n   - Statement 5 is true (Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false).\n   - Number of true statements = 4. Statement 6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\" (False, since 4 is not prime).\n   - Number of false statements = 3.

If one is true, the other *must* be false.\n\n2. **Consider Statement 5:** Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This confirms the mutual exclusivity established in step 1.\n\n3. **Evaluate possible scenarios based on Statements 3 & 4:**\n   * **Scenario 1: Statement 3 is true (5 true statements):**  If Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false. This means we have 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n   * **Scenario 2: Statement 4 is true (6 false statements):** If Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false. This means we have 1 true statement and 6 false statements.\n\n4. **Check Scenario 1 (5 True, 2 False) against all statements:**\n   * Statement 1: \"At least 4 are true.\" (True, since we have 5)\n   * Statement 2: \"At most 2 are false.\" (True, since we have 2)\n   * Statement 3: \"Exactly 5 are true.\" (True, by assumption)\n   * Statement 4: \"Exactly 6 are false.\" (False, we have 2)\n   * Statement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 is true, but not both.\" (True, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false)\n   * Statement 6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\" (True, 5 is prime)\n   * Statement 7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\" (False, 2 is prime)\n\n   Since Statement 7 is false in this scenario, Scenario 1 is inconsistent.\n\n5. **Check Scenario 2 (1 True, 6 False) against all statements:**\n   * Statement 1: \"At least 4 are true.\" (False, we have 1)\n   * Statement 2: \"At most 2 are false.\" (False, we have 6)\n   * Statement 3: \"Exactly 5 are true.\" (False, we have 1)\n   * Statement 4: \"Exactly 6 are false.\" (True, by assumption)\n   * Statement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 is true, but not both.\" (True, Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false)\n   * Statement 6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\" (False, 1 is neither prime nor composite)\n   * Statement 7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\" (True, 6 is composite)\n\n   Since Statements 1 and 2 and 6 are false in this scenario, Scenario 2 is inconsistent.\n\n6. **Re-examine the problem:** The initial approach assumed that either Statement 3 or 4 *must* be true.

Possible values for T are 5 and 7.\n   * If T = 5, then F = 2.  Statement 7 (F is composite) is false.  This contradicts the assumption that all statements must hold.\n   * If T = 7, then F = 0. Statement 7 (F is composite) is false. This contradicts the assumption that all statements must hold.\n\n10. **Consider the number of true statements:** Let's reconsider the statements and how many must be true.\n    * If Statement 1 is true (T >= 4) and Statement 2 is true (F <= 2, meaning T >= 5), then we have T >= 5.\n    * If Statement 6 is true (T is prime), then T can be 5 or 7.\n    * If Statement 7 is true (F is composite), then F can be 4 or 6.\n\n11. **Check if a solution exists:**\n    * If T = 5, F = 2. Statement 7 is false.\n    * If T = 7, F = 0.
