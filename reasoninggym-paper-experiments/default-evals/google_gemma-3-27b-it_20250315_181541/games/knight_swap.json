The goal is to move the white knights to C3 and B3, and the black knights to A2 and B2.\n\n2. **Consider possible moves:**\n   - The white knight at A2 can move to B4, C1, or C3.\n   - The white knight at B2 can move to A4, C4, D1, or D3.\n   - The black knight at B3 can move to A1, A5, C1, C5, D2, or D4.\n   - The black knight at C3 can move to A2, A4, B1, B5, D2, or D4.\n\n3. **Develop a strategy:**  We need to find a sequence of moves that achieves the swap. Let's try to move the white knight at A2 to C3 directly. Then, we can move the black knight at C3 to A2.\n\n4. **Execute the moves and check for validity:**\n\n   - Move 1: w,A2,C3\n   - Move 2: B,C3,A2\n   - Now we have white knight at C3, black knight at A2.\n   - Move 3: w,B2,D1\n   - Move 4: B,B3,D2\n   - Move 5: w,D1,B2\n   - Move 6: B,D2,B3\n\n5. **Verify the final state:** After these moves, the white knights are at C3 and B2, and the black knights are at A2 and B3.

The goal is to move the white knights to B3 and D2, and the black knights to C3 and D3.\n\n2. **Consider possible moves:**\n   - White knight at C3 can move to A4, A2, E4, E2. None of these are empty.\n   - White knight at D3 can move to B4, B2, F4, F2. None of these are empty.\n   - Black knight at B3 can move to A1, A5, C1, C5, D4, D2. D2 is occupied by a white knight, A1, A5, C1, C5 are not valid.\n   - Black knight at D2 can move to B1, B3, F1, F3. B3 is occupied by a black knight, F1 and F3 are not valid.\n\n3. **Plan a sequence of moves:**\n    - w,C3,A2\n    - b,B3,A1\n    - w,D3,B2\n    - b,D2,B1\n    - w,A2,C1\n    - b,A1,C3\n    - w,B2,D1\n    - b,B1,D3\n    - w,C1,A3\n    - b,C3,A5\n    - w,D1,B3\n    - b,A5,C5\n    - w,A3,C3\n    - b,C5,A5\n    - w,B3,D2\n    - b,A5,C5\n\nThis approach doesn't seem to lead to a solution quickly. Let's consider another approach.\n\n4. **Simplify the problem:**  Notice that the only empty squares are at A2, A1, B1, B2, C1, C2, E2, E3, E4, F1, F2, F3, F4. We need to move the knights around.\n\n5. **Consider a more direct approach:**\n   - w,C3,A2\n   - b,B3,A1\n   - w,D3,B2\n   - b,D2,B1\n   - w,A2,C1\n   - b,A1,C3\n   - w,B2,D1\n   - b,B1,D3\n\nThis doesn't seem to work either.\n\n6. **Re-evaluate the initial state:** The key is that the white knights need to end up in the positions occupied by the black knights, and vice versa.\n\n7. **Attempt a solution:**\n   - w,C3,A2\n   - b,B3,A1\n   - w,D3,B2\n   - b,D2,B1\n   - w,A2,C1\n   - b,A1,C3\n   - w,B2,D1\n   - b,B1,D3\n\nThis sequence seems to move the knights, but doesn't directly achieve the swap.\n\n8. **Final Attempt:** It seems impossible to swap the knights with the given constraints. The knights are blocked by each other and the board edges.\n\n<answer>No</answer>",

This is not the target state.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate and find a different sequence:**\n   - Move the black knight from A1 to B3: [\"B,A1,B3\"].\n   - Move the white knight from C2 to A1: [\"w,C2,A1\"].\n   - Move the black knight from C3 to C1: Not possible, so consider other moves.\n   - Move the white knight from B2 to C1: Not possible.\n   - Let's try to move the black knight from C3 to A2: [\"B,C3,A2\"].\n   - Now move the white knight from C2 to A1: [\"w,C2,A1\"].\n   - Move the black knight from A1 to B3: [\"B,A1,B3\"].\n   - Move the white knight from B2 to C3: [\"w,B2,C3\"].\n   - Move the black knight from A2 to B2: [\"B,A2,B2\"].\n\n6. **Verify the final state:** After these moves:\n   - A1: White knight (w)\n   - A2: Empty\n   - B2: Black knight (B)\n   - B3: Black knight (B)\n   - C1: Empty\n   - C2: Empty\n   - C3: White knight (w)\n   - This is still not correct.\n\n7. **Consider a simpler approach:**\n   - Move Black Knight A1 to B3: [\"B,A1,B3\"]\n   - Move White Knight C2 to A1: [\"w,C2,A1\"]\n   - Move Black Knight C3 to B2: [\"B,C3,B2\"]\n   - Move White Knight B2 to C3: [\"w,B2,C3\"]\n   Now, White knights are at A1 and C3, Black knights are at B2 and B3. This is not the goal.\n\n8. **Let's try again:**\n   - [\"B,A1,B3\"]\n   - [\"w,C2,A1\"]\n   - [\"B,C3,A2\"]\n   - [\"w,B2,C3\"]\n   - [\"B,A2,B2\"]\n\n9. **Final Verification:**\n   - A1: w\n   - B2: B\n   - B3: B\n   - C2: .\n   - C3: w\n\nIt appears that no matter what sequence of moves we try, we cannot achieve the desired swap.\n\n<answer>No</answer>",

We need to consider intermediate moves to open up paths.\n\n4. **Move Sequence:**\n   - w,B2,A4\n   - B,D1,C3\n   - w,A4,C2\n   - B,C3,A2\n   - w,C2,B4\n   - B,A2,B0 (invalid, should be A4)\n   - Let's rethink.\n   - w,B2,A4\n   - w,C1,D3\n   - B,D1,B2\n   - B,C3,A2\n   - w,D3,C1\n   - w,A4,B2\n   - B,B2,A4\n   - B,A2,C3\n   - This doesn't seem to lead to a solution.\n\n   - w,B2,A4\n   - w,C1,B3\n   - B,D1,C3\n   - B,C3,D1\n   - w,B3,C1\n   - w,A4,B2\n   - B,D1,B2\n   - B,B2,D1\n   - This also doesn't seem to work.\n\n   - w,B2,A4\n   - w,C1,D3\n   - B,D1,B2\n   - B,C3,A2\n   - w,D3,C1\n   - w,A4,B2\n   - B,B2,A4\n   - B,A2,C3\n   - Still not a solution.\n\n   - w,B2,A4\n   - B,D1,B2\n   - w,C1,D3\n   - B,C3,A2\n   - w,D3,C1\n   - w,A4,B2\n   - B,B2,A4\n   - B,A2,C3\n\n5. **Conclusion:** After attempting several move sequences, it seems very difficult to achieve the swap. Considering the limited board size and the constraints of knight movements, it's likely impossible.\n\n<answer>No</answer>",

The white knight at A3 needs to move to D1, and the black knight at D1 needs to move to A3. But the only way for the white knight to move to D1 is through B2 or C3, and those squares are occupied. Similarly, the black knight needs to move to A3, but the white knight is blocking the path.\n\n<answer>No</answer>",

The goal is to move the white knights to D1 and A3, and the black knights to A3 and B2.\n\n2. **Possible Moves:** Let's consider the possible moves for each knight.\n   - White knight at A3 can move to B1 or C2.\n   - White knight at B2 can move to A4, C4, D3, A1, C1, D1.\n   - Black knight at B2 can move to A4, C4, D3, A1, C1, D1.\n   - Black knight at D1 can move to B2 or C3.\n\n3. **Strategy:** A key observation is that the white knight at B2 needs to reach D1, and the black knight at D1 needs to reach B2. This suggests a direct swap as a good starting point.\n\n4. **Move Sequence:**\n   - White knight at B2 moves to D1.\n   - Black knight at D1 moves to B2.\n   - Now the white knight at A3 needs to move to A3 and the black knight at B2 needs to move to A3. This is not possible.\n   - Let's consider other moves.\n   - White knight at A3 moves to C2.\n   - White knight at B2 moves to D1.\n   - Black knight at D1 moves to B2.\n   - Black knight at B2 moves to A4.\n   - White knight at C2 moves to A1.\n   - Black knight at A4 moves to B2.\n   - White knight at A1 moves to B3.\n   - Black knight at B2 moves to C4.\n   - This approach does not seem to be leading to a solution.\n\n5. **Another Strategy:** Consider the white knight at A3 and the black knight at D1. It seems difficult to swap them directly.\n\n6. **Final Attempt:**\n   - w,A3,C2\n   - B,D1,B2\n   - w,B2,D1\n   - B,B2,D3\n   - w,D1,C3\n   - B,D3,B1\n   - w,C2,A1\n   - B,B1,D1\n   - w,A1,B3\n   - B,D1,C2\n   - w,B3,A3\n   - B,C2,A2\n\n   This doesn't seem to work either.\n\n7. **Conclusion:** After several attempts, it appears that swapping the knights is not possible given the constraints of the knight's movement and the requirement to reach specific target positions.\n\n<answer>No</answer>",

B at A2 can move to B4, C1, C3, B0 (invalid).\n4. B at C1 can move to A2, B3, A0 (invalid), B2.\n\nA possible sequence of moves:\n1. w,B3,A1\n2. B,A2,C1\n3. w,D3,B2\n4. B,C1,B3\n5. w,A1,C1\n6. B,B3,D3\n7. w,C1,A2\n8.

Since knights move in an L-shape, it's possible that some configurations are unsolvable. Let's consider the number of knights. We have 2 white and 2 black.\n\nIf we consider the chessboard coloring, the white knights start on squares of the same color, and the black knights start on squares of the same color. After the swap, the white knights must be on the other color, and the black knights must be on the original color. This might be a constraint.\n\nHowever, given the small size of the board, it is likely possible.\n\n1. w,B3,A1\n2. B,A2,C1\n3. w,D3,B2\n4. B,C1,B3\n5. w,A1,C1\n6. B,B3,D3\n7. w,C1,A2\n8.

A2, A4, D2, D4, E2, E4 are empty.\n\n3. **Possible Moves for White Knight at B1:** The possible moves for the white knight at B1 are A3, C3, D2, D0 (invalid), A-1 (invalid), C-1 (invalid). A3, C3 are potentially useful.\n\n4. **Possible Moves for Black Knight at B2:** The possible moves for the black knight at B2 are A4, C4, D1, D3, A0 (invalid), C0 (invalid). D1, D3, A4, C4 are empty.\n\n5. **Possible Moves for Black Knight at C1:** The possible moves for the black knight at C1 are A2, B3, D2, E3, A0 (invalid), B-1 (invalid), D0 (invalid), E-1 (invalid). A2, B3, D2, E3 are empty.\n\n6. **Attempting a Solution:**\n   - w, C3, B1: This is not a valid move as B1 is occupied.\n   - w, C3, A2: Move white knight from C3 to A2.\n   - B, B2, D3: Move black knight from B2 to D3.\n   - w, B1, C3: Move white knight from B1 to C3.\n   - B, C1, A2: Move black knight from C1 to A2.\n\n7. **Continuing the sequence:**\n   - w, A2, C1: Move white knight from A2 to C1.\n   - B, D3, B2: Move black knight from D3 to B2.\n   - w, C1, B2: Move white knight from C1 to B2.\n   - B, A2, C3: Move black knight from A2 to C3.\n   - w, B2, C3: Move white knight from B2 to C3.\n\n8. **Checking the final positions:**\n   - White knights are at C3 and B2.\n   - Black knights are at C1 and B2.\n   - This does not satisfy the condition.\n\n9. **Let's try another sequence:**\n   - w, C3, A2\n   - B, B2, A4\n   - w, B1, C3\n   - B, C1, B3\n   - w, A2, B4\n   - B, A4, C2\n   - w, B4, D3\n   - B, B3, D1\n   - w, D3, B1\n   - B, D1, A3\n   - w, B1, C3\n   - B, A3, C1\n\n10. **Another attempt:**\n    - w, C3, A2\n    - B, B2, D3\n    - w, B1, C3\n    - B, C1, A2\n    - w, A2, B4\n    - B, D3, B1\n    - w, B4, C2\n    - B, A2, C4\n\n11. **Trying a different approach:**\n    - w, C3, B1 (Invalid)\n    - w, C3, A2\n    - B, B2, D3\n    - w, A2, C1\n    - B, C1, A2\n    - w, C1, B2\n    - B, A2, C3\n    - w, B2, C3\n\nThis appears to be a difficult puzzle.

C1 is the only valid move since B1 and C5 are outside the board.\n   - White Knight at C3: Can move to A2, A4, B1, B5, D2, D4.

Let's verify:\n- A3 initially had 'w', now has 'B'\n- C3 initially had 'w', now has 'w' (incorrect, should have 'B')\n- B1 initially had 'B', now has 'w'\n- C1 initially had 'B', now has 'w'\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. w A3 -> B1\n2.

Let's consider the problem more generally. We need to move two white knights to the positions of the two black knights, and vice versa.\n\nConsider the following moves:\n1. w A3 -> B1\n2. B B1 -> A3\n3. w C3 -> B3\n4. B C1 -> A2\n5. w B1 -> C1\n6. B A3 -> B1\n7. w B3 -> C3\n8.

The white knights are blocked by each other and the black knights, and the available empty spaces don't allow for a clean swap.\n\n<answer>No</answer>",
