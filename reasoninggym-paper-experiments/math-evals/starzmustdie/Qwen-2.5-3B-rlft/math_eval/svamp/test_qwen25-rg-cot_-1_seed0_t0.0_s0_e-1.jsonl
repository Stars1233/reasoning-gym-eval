Here are the steps to reason through the problem:\n\n1. Identify the initial number of children on the bus:\n   - Initially, there were 28 children on the bus.\n\n2. Determine the number of children who got on the bus:\n   - At the bus stop, 82 children got on the bus.\n\n3. Let \\( x \\) be the number of children who got off the bus. After these children got off, the number of children on the bus would be the initial number of children plus the number who got on, minus the number who got off:\n   - Therefore, the equation representing the situation after some children got off is:\n     \\[\n     28 + 82 - x = 30\n     \\]\n\n4. Simplify the equation to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   28 + 82 - x = 30\n   \\]\n   Combine the constants on the left side:\n   \\[\n   110 - x = 30\n   \\]\n   Isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 30 from 110:\n   \\[\n   110 - 30 = x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 80\n   \\]\n   So, 80 children got off the bus.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between the number of children who got on the bus and those who got off:\n   - Number of children who got on the bus: 82\n   - Number of children who got off the bus: 80\n   - The difference is:\n     \\[\n     82 - 80 = 2\n     \\]\n</think> \n<answer> \\boxed{2}"], "pred": ["2"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

Hence, the baker sold all 52 pastries and had a deficit of 42 pastries. This implies no pastries are left to compare with cakes.\n\n4.

Hence, the baker sold all 84 cakes and had a deficit of 18 cakes. This implies no cakes are left to compare with pastries.\n\n5. Correct interpretation:\n   - Since the baker sold more pastries than he had (94 > 52), he sold all pastries and had a deficit.\n   - Similarly, since the baker sold more cakes than he had (102 > 84), he sold all cakes and had a deficit.\n\n6.

Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each of his friends, we need to divide both the total number of crackers and the total number of cakes by the number of friends.\n   - Number of crackers each friend received = Total crackers ÷ Number of friends\n   - Number of cakes each friend received = Total cakes ÷ Number of friends\n\n5.

Perform the division for the cakes (though this step is not necessary to find the number of crackers each friend received, it confirms the equal distribution):\n   - Total cakes = 34\n   - Number of friends = 11\n   - Cakes per friend = 34 ÷ 11 (This division does not need to be exact for the crackers, but it confirms the equal distribution concept).\n\nThus, each friend received 2 crackers.\n</think> \n<answer> \\boxed{2}"], "pred": ["2"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

According to the problem:\n- Paco ate 19 cookies.\n- After eating, he had 35 cookies left.\n\nThe relationship between the initial number of cookies, the number of cookies eaten, and the number of cookies left can be expressed with the equation:\n\\[ x = \\text{(number of cookies eaten)} + \\text{(number of cookies left)} \\]\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n\\[ x = 19 + 35 \\]\n\nNext, we perform the addition:\n\\[ 19 + 35 = 54 \\]\n\nThus, the initial number of cookies Paco had is 54.\n</think> \n<answer> \\boxed{54}"], "pred": ["54"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

The problem states that Rebecca wants to split her collection of eggs into groups of 11, and each group contains 2 eggs. We need to find the total number of eggs.\n\nLet's denote the total number of eggs Rebecca has by \\( E \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n- Each group contains 2 eggs.\n- The groups are formed such that each group has 11 eggs.\n\nTo find the total number of eggs, we need to determine how many such groups can be formed. Since each group contains 11 eggs, and each group also contains 2 eggs, we need to find a common multiple of these two numbers (11 and 2) that represents the total number of eggs.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the number of such groups directly. Instead, it implies that the total number of eggs \\( E \\) can be expressed as a product of the number of groups and the number of eggs per group. Given that each group has 11 eggs and each group also has 2 eggs, we need to find a consistent interpretation.\n\nSince the problem does not provide the number of groups explicitly, we infer that the total number of eggs \\( E \\) must be a multiple of both 11 and 2. The least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 2 is calculated as follows:\n- The prime factorization of 11 is \\( 11 \\).\n- The prime factorization of 2 is \\( 2 \\).\n- The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations, which is \\( 11 \\times 2 = 22 \\).\n\nThus, the total number of eggs \\( E \\) must be a multiple of 22. Given the problem's constraints and the need to form groups of 11 eggs each with 2 eggs per group, the smallest consistent number of eggs that fits both conditions is 22.\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs Rebecca has is 22.\n</think> \n<answer> \\boxed{22}"], "pred": ["22"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}
