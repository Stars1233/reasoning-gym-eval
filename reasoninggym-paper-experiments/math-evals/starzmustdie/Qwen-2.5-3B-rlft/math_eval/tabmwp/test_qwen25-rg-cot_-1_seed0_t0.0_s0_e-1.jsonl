So, the function has a constant rate of change.\nThe function is linear.", "ques_type": "multi_choice", "ans_type": "boolean_text", "answer": "linear", "code": ["<think> \nTo determine whether the function shown in the table is linear or nonlinear, we need to analyze the relationship between the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). A function is considered linear if it satisfies the equation \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) are constants, and the graph of the function is a straight line. For a function to be nonlinear, it does not fit this form.\n\nThe given table provides the following pairs of \\((x, y)\\):\n- When \\(x = 8\\), \\(y = 6\\)\n- When \\(x = 9\\), \\(y = 11\\)\n- When \\(x = 10\\), \\(y = 16\\)\n\nTo determine if the function is linear, we need to check if the change in \\(y\\) (Δy) divided by the change in \\(x\\) (Δx) is constant for all pairs of \\((x, y)\\). This change is known as the slope of the line.\n\nWe can calculate the slope between each pair of points:\n1. Between \\(x = 8\\) and \\(x = 9\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{11 - 6}{9 - 8} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2.

This indicates that the function is increasing at a constant rate, which is a characteristic of a linear function.\n\nTo further confirm, we can check if the general form \\(y = mx + b\\) holds for these points. We can use the points to solve for the slope \\(m\\) and the y-intercept \\(b\\). Using the points \\((8, 6)\\) and \\((9, 11)\\):\n- The slope \\(m\\) is:\n  \\[\n  m = \\frac{11 - 6}{9 - 8} = 5\n  \\]\n- Using the point-slope form \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) with \\((8, 6)\\):\n  \\[\n  y - 6 = 5(x - 8)\n  \\]\n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  y - 6 = 5x - 40 \\implies y = 5x - 34\n  \\]\nThis equation \\(y = 5x - 34\\) confirms that the function is linear, as it fits the form \\(y = mx + b\\) with \\(m = 5\\) and \\(b = -34\\).\n\nSince the function consistently shows a constant rate of change (slope of 5) and fits the linear equation form, we conclude that the function is linear.\n</think> \n<answer> [ 'linear' ]"], "pred": ["['linear']"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

The table provides us with the following data:\n- 1 jar contains 10 fireflies.\n- 2 jars contain 20 fireflies.\n\nWe observe that the number of fireflies is directly proportional to the number of jars. Specifically, for each additional jar, the number of fireflies increases by 10. This can be seen from the given data:\n- 1 jar: 10 fireflies\n- 2 jars: 20 fireflies (which is 10 + 10)\n\nTo generalize this pattern:\n- If 1 jar contains 10 fireflies, then 2 jars would contain 10 (for the first jar) + 10 (for the second jar) = 20 fireflies.\n- Following this logic, 3 jars would contain 10 (for the first jar) + 10 (for the second jar) + 10 (for the third jar) = 30 fireflies.\n\nThus, the number of fireflies in 3 jars is calculated by summing the fireflies in each individual jar:\n- 1st jar: 10 fireflies\n- 2nd jar: 10 fireflies\n- 3rd jar: 10 fireflies\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, 3 jars contain 30 fireflies.\n</think> \n<answer> \\boxed{30}"], "pred": ["30"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

To find the pattern, we can look at the relationship between the number of buckets and the number of red blocks:\n\n- For 1 bucket: \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\)\n- For 2 buckets: \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n- For 3 buckets: \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n- For 4 buckets: \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\)\n- For 5 buckets: \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\)\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the number of red blocks is calculated by multiplying the number of buckets by 5. This pattern suggests that each bucket consistently contains 5 red blocks, and the total number of red blocks for any number of buckets is the product of the number of buckets and 5.\n\nTo find the number of red blocks in 6 buckets, we apply the same rule:\n\\[ 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\]\n</think> \n<answer> \\boxed{30}"], "pred": ["30"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}
