The most common coin denominations in the United States are 1 cent (penny), 5 cents (nickel), 10 cents (dime), and 25 cents (quarter). To minimize the number of coins, we should maximize the use of the largest denomination coins first, as this will require fewer coins in total.\n\n1. Start with the largest denomination, which is the quarter (25 cents). Using one quarter:\n   \\[\n   28 \\text{ cents} - 25 \\text{ cents} = 3 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n   This leaves us with 3 cents remaining.\n\n2. Next, consider the next largest denomination, which is the nickel (5 cents). Using one nickel:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ cents} - 5 \\text{ cents} = -2 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n   Since using one nickel would exceed the remaining 3 cents, we cannot use another nickel.

Use the remaining 3 cents with pennies:\n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ cents} - 3 \\text{ cents} = 0 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n   This uses exactly 3 pennies.\n\nThus, the combination of one quarter, one nickel, and three pennies sums up to 28 cents:\n\\[\n25 \\text{ cents} + 5 \\text{ cents} + 3 \\text{ cents} = 28 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\nThis combination uses a total of:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ (quarter)} + 1 \\text{ (nickel)} + 3 \\text{ (pennies)} = 5 \\text{ coins}\n\\]\nTo ensure this is the minimum, we should consider if using a combination of smaller denominations could result in fewer coins.

Let's denote the number of beads per necklace by \\( x \\). Therefore, the total number of beads needed is \\( 15 \\times x \\).\n\nGiven that Betty currently has 367 beads, we need to find out how many more beads are needed to reach the total required beads.

The smallest \\( x \\) that satisfies this condition is the smallest integer such that \\( 15 \\times x \\geq 367 \\).\n\nWe start by dividing 367 by 15 to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to the quotient:\n\\[ \\frac{367}{15} \\approx 24.4667 \\]\nThis means that the smallest integer greater than 24.4667 is 25.

We know that Martin's second stroke was the final stroke, and it put the ball in the hole. This means that the distance Martin hit on his second stroke was exactly the distance from where he was standing to the hole. According to the problem, this distance was 79 meters.\n\nOn Martin's first stroke, his golf ball traveled \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) of the total distance to the hole. This implies that the distance Martin hit on his second stroke, which was 79 meters, is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the total distance to the hole.

According to the problem, the distance Martin hit on his second stroke (which is 79 meters) is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the total distance \\(D\\). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times D = 79\n\\]\nTo find \\(D\\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[\nD = 79 \\times 5\n\\]\nCalculating the right-hand side, we get:\n\\[\nD = 79 \\times 5 = 79 \\times (2 + 3) = 79 \\times 2 + 79 \\times 3 = 158 + 237 = 395\n\\]\nSo, the total distance to the hole is 395 meters.

Identify the ratio of the two pieces of wire: The ratio given is 7:5. This means that for every 7 parts of the wire, there are 5 parts.\n2. Understand the relationship between the pieces: The shorter piece corresponds to the 5 parts of the ratio, and we know the length of this shorter piece is 40 cm.\n3. Calculate the length of one part of the ratio: Since 5 parts correspond to 40 cm, we can find the length of one part by dividing 40 cm by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of one part} = \\frac{40 \\text{ cm}}{5} = 8 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n4. Determine the length of the longer piece: The longer piece corresponds to 7 parts of the ratio. Therefore, we multiply the length of one part (8 cm) by 7:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of the longer piece} = 7 \\times 8 \\text{ cm} = 56 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n5. Calculate the total length of the original piece of wire: The original piece of wire is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces. Thus, we add the lengths of the shorter piece (40 cm) and the longer piece (56 cm):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total length of the original piece} = 40 \\text{ cm} + 56 \\text{ cm} = 96 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n</think> \n<answer> \\boxed{96}"], "pred": ["96"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

The total number of cookies is 1802, and the number of friends is 34. This involves performing the division of 1802 by 34. We can express this mathematically as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1802}{34} \\]\n\nTo perform the division, we can break it down step by step. First, we see how many times 34 goes into 180. We know that:\n\n\\[ 34 \\times 5 = 170 \\]\n\nSo, 34 goes into 180 five times, leaving a remainder. We subtract 170 from 180 to find the remainder:\n\n\\[ 180 - 170 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, we bring down the next digit from 1802, which is 2, making the number 102. We need to determine how many times 34 goes into 102. We know that:\n\n\\[ 34 \\times 3 = 102 \\]\n\nSo, 34 goes into 102 three times exactly, with no remainder. Therefore, the quotient of 1802 divided by 34 is:\n\n\\[ 1802 \\div 34 = 53 \\]\n\nTo verify, we can multiply the quotient by the divisor and check if it matches the original dividend:\n\n\\[ 53 \\times 34 = 53 \\times (30 + 4) = 53 \\times 30 + 53 \\times 4 = 1590 + 212 = 1802 \\]\n\nThe division is correct, confirming that each of Albert's 34 friends will get 53 cookies.\n</think> \n<answer> \\boxed{53}"], "pred": ["53"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}
