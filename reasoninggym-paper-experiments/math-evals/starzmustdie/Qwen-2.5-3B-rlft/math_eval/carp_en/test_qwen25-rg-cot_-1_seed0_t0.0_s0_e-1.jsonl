The original equation has a potential singularity at \\(x = 5\\), where the denominator \\(x - 5\\) is zero. To ensure there is no additional root at \\(x = 5\\), we need to check if substituting \\(x = 5\\) into the simplified equation leads to any contradictions or additional solutions.\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 5\\) into the equation \\(2x - 11 = m\\):\n\n\\[\n2(5) - 11 = m \\implies 10 - 11 = m \\implies m = -1\n\\]\n\nIf \\(m = -1\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n2x - 11 = -1\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n2x - 11 = -1 \\implies 2x = 10 \\implies x = 5\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that \\(x = 5\\) is a root of the equation when \\(m = -1\\). However, substituting \\(x = 5\\) into the original equation results in division by zero, which is undefined. Therefore, \\(x = 5\\) is not a valid solution for the original equation. This suggests that the value \\(m = -1\\) does not introduce an additional root but rather confirms the original equation's behavior at \\(x = 5\\).\n\nTo ensure there is no increase in the number of roots, we need to consider the behavior of the equation for other values of \\(x\\). The equation \\(2x - 11 = m\\) is linear and will have exactly one solution for any given \\(m\\). Therefore, the value \\(m = -1\\) does not produce an increase in the number of roots; it merely confirms the original equation's behavior.\n\nGiven the problem's requirement for an increase in the number of roots, we need to reconsider the setup. The increase in roots typically involves additional solutions or singularities, which are not present in the linear relationship derived. Hence, the value \\(m = -1\\) does not produce an increase in the number of roots.\n\nThus, there is no specific value of \\(m\\) that produces an increase in the number of roots for the given equation. The equation remains consistent with one root for any \\(m\\).\n</think> \n<answer> \\boxed{-1}"], "pred": ["-1"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

For the square root to be defined in the set of real numbers, the expression inside the square root must be greater than zero.
