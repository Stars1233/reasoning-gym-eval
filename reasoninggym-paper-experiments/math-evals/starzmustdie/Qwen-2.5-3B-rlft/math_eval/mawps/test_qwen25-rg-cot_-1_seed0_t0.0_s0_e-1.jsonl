The number of balloons James has is 1222, and the number of balloons Amy has is 513. Therefore, we need to perform the subtraction \\(1222 - 513\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n1. Start with the number of balloons James has: 1222.\n2. Subtract the number of balloons Amy has: 513.\n   - Subtract the units place: \\(2 - 3\\). Since 2 is less than 3, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place. This makes it \\(12 - 3 = 9\\).\n   - Subtract the tens place: \\(1 - 1 = 0\\).\n   - Subtract the hundreds place: \\(2 - 5\\). Again, since 2 is less than 5, we need to borrow 1 from the thousands place. This makes it \\(12 - 5 = 7\\).\n   - Subtract the thousands place: \\(1 - 0 = 1\\).\n\nSo, the subtraction \\(1222 - 513\\) results in:\n\\[ 1222 - 513 = 709 \\]\n\nThus, James has 709 more balloons than Amy.\n</think> \n<answer> \\boxed{709}"], "pred": ["709"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
