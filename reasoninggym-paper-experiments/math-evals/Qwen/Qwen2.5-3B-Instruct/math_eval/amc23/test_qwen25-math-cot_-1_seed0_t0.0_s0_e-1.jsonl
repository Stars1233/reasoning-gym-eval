Since the digits 2, 0, and 3 each appear at least once (and at least twice), the digits M and D must each appear an even number of times. However, M and D can only be digits from 0 to 9, and since they are part of the month and day, they must be two-digit numbers (01 to 31).\n\nLet's analyze the parity of M and D:\n- M can be any two-digit number from 01 to 31. The digits of M are M1 (where M is the tens digit and 1 is the units digit).\n- D can be any two-digit number from 01 to 31. The digits of D are D1 (where D is the tens digit and 1 is the units digit).\n\nFor M and D to have an even number of each digit, M and D must be such that the sum of the digits of M and D is even. This means that the sum of the tens digits of M and D must be even, and the sum of the units digits (1) must be odd. Since 1 is always odd, the tens digits of M and D must have an even sum.\n\nThe tens digits of M and D can be any digit from 0 to 3. The possible pairs of tens digits (M1 and D1) that have an even sum are:\n- (0, 0)\n- (0, 2)\n- (0, 4)\n- (0, 6)\n- (0, 8)\n- (2, 0)\n- (2, 2)\n- (2, 4)\n- (2, 6)\n- (2, 8)\n- (4, 0)\n- (4, 2)\n- (4, 4)\n- (4, 6)\n- (4, 8)\n- (6, 0)\n- (6, 2)\n- (6, 4)\n- (6, 6)\n- (6, 8)\n- (8, 0)\n- (8, 2)\n- (8, 4)\n- (8, 6)\n- (8, 8)\n\nThere are 25 such pairs. For each pair of tens digits, the units digit is always 1, which is odd. Therefore, each pair of tens digits (M1 and D1) is valid.\n\nSince M and D can be any of these 25 pairs, and each pair is valid, the number of valid dates is 25.\n\nThus, the number of dates in 2023 where each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display is \\(\\boxed{25}\\)."], "pred": ["25"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
