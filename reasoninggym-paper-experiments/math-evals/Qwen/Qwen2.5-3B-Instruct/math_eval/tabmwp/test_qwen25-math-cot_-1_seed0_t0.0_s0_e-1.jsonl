Each row in the stem-and-leaf plot represents a range of fish counts, with the stem (the tens digit) and the leaf (the ones digit).\n\nLet's break down the data:\n\n- **Stem 3**: The leaves are 5 and 8. This means there are fish counts of 35 and 38.\n- **Stem 4**: The leaves are 0, 2, 4, 4, and 6. This means there are fish counts of 40, 42, 44, 44, and 46.\n- **Stem 5**: The leaves are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, and 8. This means there are fish counts of 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 56, 58, and 58.\n- **Stem 6**: The leaf is 3. This means there is a fish count of 63.\n\nNow, we need to count how many of these fish counts are less than 70:\n\n- From stem 3, we have 35 and 38 (both less than 70).\n- From stem 4, we have 40, 42, 44, 44, and 46 (all less than 70).\n- From stem 5, we have 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 56, 58, and 58 (all less than 70).\n- From stem 6, we have 63 (less than 70).\n\nAdding these up, we have:\n- 2 counts from stem 3\n- 5 counts from stem 4\n- 9 counts from stem 5\n- 1 count from stem 6\n\nSo, the total number of tanks with fewer than 70 fish is:\n\\[ 2 + 5 + 9 + 1 = 17 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{17}\\)."], "pred": ["17"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

A linear function typically has a constant rate of change, meaning the difference in \\(y\\) values divided by the difference in \\(x\\) values should be constant.\n\nLet's calculate the differences in \\(y\\) for each corresponding \\(x\\):\n\n1. From \\(x = 12\\) to \\(x = 13\\):\n   \\[\n   y_{13} - y_{12} = 11 - 13 = -2\n   \\]\n\n2. From \\(x = 13\\) to \\(x = 14\\):\n   \\[\n   y_{14} - y_{13} = 9 - 11 = -2\n   \\]\n\nWe observe that the change in \\(y\\) is consistently \\(-2\\) for each unit increase in \\(x\\). This indicates a constant rate of change of \\(-2\\).\n\nTo further confirm, let's check the slope between other pairs of points:\n- From \\(x = 12\\) to \\(x = 14\\):\n  \\[\n  y_{14} - y_{12} = 9 - 13 = -4\n  \\]\n  This change is \\(-4\\), which is not consistent with the previous changes.\n\nSince the rate of change is not constant (\\(-2\\) for the first two points but \\(-4\\) for the last two points), the function is not linear.\n\nTherefore, the function is \\boxed{nonlinear}."], "pred": ["nonlinear"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
