Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "B", "code": ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined rate at which P and Q eat the candies and then find the time it takes for them to finish the jar together.\n\n1. **Determine the individual rates:**\n   - P eats the jar in 10 minutes, so P's rate is \\( \\frac{1 \\text{ jar}}{10 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1}{10} \\text{ jar per minute} \\).\n   - Q eats half the jar in 5 minutes, so Q eats the full jar in \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\) minutes. Thus, Q's rate is \\( \\frac{1 \\text{ jar}}{10 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1}{10} \\text{ jar per minute} \\).\n\n2. **Combine the rates:**\n   - Since P and Q are eating simultaneously, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Combined rate} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5} \\text{ jar per minute}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time to finish the jar:**\n   - If their combined rate is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\text{ jar per minute} \\), then the time \\( T \\) it takes to finish the jar is:\n     \\[\n     T = \\frac{1 \\text{ jar}}{\\frac{1}{5} \\text{ jar per minute}} = 5 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThus, it would take them 5 minutes to empty the jar.
