Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of the two sons was one-third of their father's age.\n2. One son is two years older than the other, and the sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age.\n\nFirst, let's translate the second piece of information into an equation. Since one son is two years older than the other, we can express their ages as \\( S_1 = S_2 + 2 \\) or \\( S_2 = S_1 - 2 \\). The sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age, so we have:\n\\[ S_1 + S_2 = F - 14. \\]\nSubstituting \\( S_1 = S_2 + 2 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ (S_2 + 2) + S_2 = F - 14, \\]\n\\[ 2S_2 + 2 = F - 14, \\]\n\\[ 2S_2 = F - 16, \\]\n\\[ S_2 = \\frac{F - 16}{2}. \\]\nSince \\( S_1 = S_2 + 2 \\), we have:\n\\[ S_1 = \\frac{F - 16}{2} + 2 = \\frac{F - 16 + 4}{2} = \\frac{F - 12}{2}. \\]\n\nNext, let's use the first piece of information. Ten years ago, the sum of their ages was:\n\\[ (S_1 - 10) + (S_2 - 10) = S_1 + S_2 - 20. \\]\nThis sum was one-third of their father's age ten years ago, so:\n\\[ S_1 + S_2 - 20 = \\frac{F - 10}{3}. \\]\nWe already know that \\( S_1 + S_2 = F - 14 \\), so:\n\\[ F - 14 - 20 = \\frac{F - 10}{3}, \\]\n\\[ F - 34 = \\frac{F - 10}{3}, \\]\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to clear the fraction, we get:\n\\[ 3(F - 34) = F - 10, \\]\n\\[ 3F - 102 = F - 10, \\]\n\\[ 2F = 92, \\]\n\\[ F = 46. \\]\nNow we can find \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\):\n\\[ S_2 = \\frac{46 - 16}{2} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15, \\]\n\\[ S_1 = S_2 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17. \\]\nSo the present ages of the sons are 15 and 17, and the father's age is 46.

Calculate the total number of Skittles Juan consumed.\n5. Subtract the number of Skittles Juan ate from the initial number of Skittles he had.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the initial number of Skittles Juan had. Since the problem only provides the number of Skittles Juan ate and the number of Skittles per package, we can only determine how many packages he ate, but not the total number of Skittles he had initially.\n\nJuan ate 24 Skittles, and each package contains 6 Skittles. We can find out how many packages he ate by dividing the number of Skittles he ate by the number of Skittles per package:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of packages} = \\frac{24 \\text{ Skittles}}{6 \\text{ Skittles per package}} = 4 \\text{ packages}\n\\]\n\nSince each package contains 6 Skittles, the total number of Skittles Juan ate is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ packages} \\times 6 \\text{ Skittles per package} = 24 \\text{ Skittles}\n\\]\n\nWithout the initial number of Skittles, we can only conclude that Juan ate 24 Skittles. If we assume he started with 24 Skittles (which is a reasonable assumption given the problem's context), then he would have:\n\n\\[\n24 \\text{ Skittles} - 24 \\text{ Skittles} = 0 \\text{ Skittles}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the problem does not specify the initial number of Skittles, the most accurate answer based on the information given is that Juan has 0 Skittles left if he started with 24 Skittles.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{0}"], "pred": ["0"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}
