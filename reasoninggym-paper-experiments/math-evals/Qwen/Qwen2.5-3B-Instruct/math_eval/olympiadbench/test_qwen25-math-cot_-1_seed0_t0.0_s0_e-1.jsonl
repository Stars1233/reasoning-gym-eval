Suppose, if possible, that no $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$. Without loss of generality, we may (and will) assume that $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{k}<t_{k+1}=1$. Since the open interval $\\left(t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}\\right)$ isolates $t_{i}$ from the other $t_{j}$, its length, $t_{i+1}-t_{i-1}$, is less than $\\lambda$. Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range. Since $m_{i} \\geq 2$ if $i$ is in $I_{0}$, and $m_{i} \\geq 1$ if $i$ is in $I_{1}$ (recall that the $m_{i}$ are positive integers),\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in I_{0}} m_{i}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}} m_{i} \\geq 2\\left|I_{0}\\right|+\\left|I_{1}\\right|=2(k-2)-\\left|I_{1}\\right|, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad\\left|I_{1}\\right| \\geq 2(k-2)-\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{i}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{k}}{2}\\right\\rfloor & \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} \\frac{m_{i}}{2}-\\frac{\\left|I_{1}\\right|}{2}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}-(k-2)+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i}-k+2 .\n\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$"], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To determine the largest real number \\(\\mu\\) such that for every \\(4n\\)-point configuration \\(C\\) in an open unit square \\(U\\), there exists an open rectangle in \\(U\\) whose sides are parallel to those of \\(U\\) and which contains exactly one point of \\(C\\), and has an area greater than or equal to \\(\\mu\\), we need to analyze the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, consider the area of the unit square \\(U\\), which is 1.

By maximality of $\\mathcal{C}$, the collection $\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{P\\}$ does not satisfy the requirements imposed on $\\mathcal{C}$; since $P \\cup C \\neq X$, this may happen only if $C \\cup P=P$, i.e., if $C \\subset P$. But then $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{T} \\backslash\\{C\\}) \\cup \\mathcal{C}$ is a tight subcollection in $\\mathcal{B}$ : all elements of $C$ are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ at least twice (by $P$ and an element of $\\mathcal{C}$ ), and all the rest elements are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ the same number of times as by $\\mathcal{T}$. A contradiction. Thus $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nSuch modifications may be performed finitely many times, since the total number of elements of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ increases.

Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$. Then, as the union of the sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ is distinct from $X$, we should have $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}_{x} \\cup\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}$. But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal.

First, we note a key property:\n\n\n\nClaim (Sign of $f$ ). $f$ attains wither only nonnegative values, or only nonpositive values.\n\n\n\nProof. This follows from the fact that the zero-set of $f$ is very sparse: if $f$ takes on a positive and a negative value, we can move $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ from the negative value to the positive value without ever having them form a regular $2 n$-gon - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nThe strategy for showing $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ is the following. We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n<img_3624>\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$.

Since each domino covers two cells of different colours, at least $\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ cells are not covered in each of these regions, and the conclusion follows.\n\n\n\n<img_3888>\n\n\n\nFig. 4\n\n<img_3590>\n\n\n\nFig. 5\n\n\n\nTo deal with the remaining case where bad fictitious dominoes are present, we show that an arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement can be transformed into another such with at least as many dominoes, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. A finite number of such transformations eventually leads to an arrangement of at least as many dominoes all of whose fictitious dominoes are good, and the conclusion follows by the preceding.\n\n\n\nConsider the row of minimal rank containing bad fictitious dominoes - this is certainly not the bottom row - and let $D$ be one such. Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. (Figure 5 illustrates the two cases.)", "We present an alternative proof of the bound.\n\n\n\nLabel the rows upwards $0,1, \\ldots, m-1$, and the columns from the left to the right by $0,1, \\ldots, 2 n-1$; label each cell by the pair of its column's and row's numbers, so that $(1,0)$ is the second left cell in the bottom row. Colour the cells chess-like so that $(0,0)$ is white. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal. (In other words, the black cell of any such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomino is to the right or to the top of its white cell.) Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty. Thus, the number of dominoes in $R$ is at most $(w-d+j)-(j-i)=w-(d-i)$, so $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells, as we wanted to show."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on a rectangular board with \\( m \\) rows and \\( 2n \\) columns under the given conditions, we will analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Board and Domino Placement:**\n   - The board has \\( m \\) rows and \\( 2n \\) columns.\n   - Each domino covers exactly 2 adjacent cells.\n   - No two dominoes can overlap.\n   - No two dominoes can form a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square.\n   - The bottom row is completely covered by \\( n \\) dominoes.\n\n2. **Counting the Dominoes in the Bottom Row:**\n   - Since the bottom row is completely covered by \\( n \\) dominoes, we have \\( n \\) dominoes covering \\( 2n \\) cells.\n\n3. **Remaining Cells and Domino Placement:**\n   - After placing \\( n \\) dominoes in the bottom row, we have \\( m-1 \\) rows and \\( 2n \\) columns left.\n   - The remaining cells are \\( (m-1) \\times 2n \\).\n\n4. **Avoiding \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) Squares:**\n   - To avoid forming \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) squares, we need to ensure that no two dominoes in the remaining part of the board can form a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square.\n   - This means that if a domino is placed horizontally in one column, the next domino in that column must be placed vertically.\n\n5. **Maximizing the Number of Dominoes:**\n   - We can place dominoes in the remaining part of the board by alternating horizontal and vertical placements.\n   - For each column, we can place at most one horizontal domino and one vertical domino, except for the last column where we can place one more horizontal domino if necessary.\n\n6. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Dominoes:**\n   - In each of the \\( m-1 \\) rows, we can place at most \\( n \\) dominoes (since the bottom row is already covered).\n   - Therefore, the total number of dominoes is \\( (m-1) \\times n \\).\n\nThus, the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on the board under the given conditions is \\(\\boxed{(m-1)n}\\)."], "pred": ["(-1)n"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Again we have $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)$ which by our assumption implies that $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)+(f(y)-f(x))=f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$. Hence by the problem condition $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$.

Let us change the rule for this collision, and enforce these two ants to turn anticlockwise. Then the succeeding behavior of all the ants does not change; the only difference is that $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$ swap their positions. These arguments may be applied to any collision separately, so we may assume that at any collision, either both ants rotate clockwise or both of them rotate anticlockwise by our own choice.\n\nFor instance, we may assume that there are only two types of ants, depending on their initial direction: NE-ants, which move only north or east, and $S W$-ants, moving only south and west. Then we immediately obtain that all ants will have fallen off the board after $2 m-1$ time units. However, we can get a better bound by considering the last moment at which a given ant collides with another ant.\n\nChoose a coordinate system such that the corners of the checkerboard are $(0,0),(m, 0),(m, m)$ and $(0, m)$. At time $t$, there will be no NE-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y<t+1\\}$ and no SW-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y>2 m-t-1\\}$.

This means that the ants will form closed loops or paths that do not necessarily lead to the edges of the checkerboard.\n\nTo understand the behavior, let's consider a smaller example, say a 2x2 checkerboard. If we place ants at the midpoints of the squares, they will form a closed loop. Specifically, if we place ants at the midpoints of the squares in a 2x2 grid, they will form a loop that does not necessarily lead to the edges of the checkerboard.

We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins $(52 i+36,52 j+1)$ with $0 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq m-2$; second, we use all napkins $(52 i+1,52 j+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m-2$; third, we use all napkins $(52 i+36,52 i+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq m-2$; and finally the napkin $(1,1)$. Different groups of napkins are shown by different types of hatchings in the picture.\n\nNow except for those squares that carry two or more different hatchings, all squares have the number 1 written into them.

Then in each of the sums $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ there exists a term greater than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number $N$ of strawberries is at most $2 g$.\n\nWe shall now estimate $N$ in a different way. For each of the $2 \\cdot 35 \\mathrm{~m}$ small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case.

Let $S=35, H=17, m=39$; so the table size is $2011=S m+H(m-1)$, and the napkin size is $52=S+H$. Fix any positive integer $M$ and call a cell vicious if it contains a number distinct\n\n\n\nfrom $M$. We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$. So in each case we have $\\frac{\\alpha}{S}+\\frac{\\beta}{H} \\geq 1$.\n\nPerforming this argument separately for each small row and adding up all the obtained inequalities, we get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{b}{H} \\geq m S$. Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Averaging the previous result over all $S^{2} H^{2}$ possibilities for the quadruple $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}, h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, we get $2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b}{S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}$.

Each napkin covers a 52 by 52 square, and we need to find the maximum number of cells that can contain the same nonzero number.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cells covered by all the napkins. Since each napkin covers 52 by 52 = 2704 cells, and there are \\( n \\) napkins, the total number of cells covered is \\( 2704n \\). However, we need to consider the overlap between the napkins.\n\nTo maximize the number of cells with the same number, we should try to place the napkins in such a way that the overlap is minimized. The most efficient way to do this is to place the napkins in a grid-like pattern, ensuring that each napkin overlaps as little as possible with others.\n\nThe side length of the table is 2011, and each napkin is 52 cells wide. Therefore, the number of napkins that can fit along one side of the table is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2011}{52} \\right\\rfloor = 38 \\).

If we place the napkins in a grid pattern, each napkin will cover a unique set of cells, and the overlap will be minimized. The number of cells covered by each napkin is 2704, but the number of cells that can contain the same number is limited by the size of the table and the placement of the napkins.\n\nTo find the maximum number of cells that can contain the same number, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the number of cells with the same number is maximized. If we place the napkins in a way that each napkin covers a unique set of cells, the maximum number of cells that can contain the same number is the number of cells in the smallest possible set of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins.\n\nSince each napkin covers 2704 cells, and we have 1444 napkins, the maximum number of cells that can contain the same number is the number of cells in the smallest possible set of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins. The smallest possible set of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins is the number of cells in the smallest possible set of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins, which is 1.\n\nHowever, if we consider the worst-case scenario where the number of cells with the same number is maximized, the maximum number of cells that can contain the same number is the number of cells in the smallest possible set of cells that can be covered by the same number of napkins, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the largest value of \\( k \\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."], "pred": ["1"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

First, we make two easy observations on the flags $2 \\times 1$ which can be checked manually.\n\n(i) For each $A \\in \\mathcal{S}$, there exists only one $2 \\times 1$ flag $C \\in \\mathcal{S}$ (possibly $C=A$ ) such that $A$ and $C$ cannot form a $2 \\times 2$ square with monochrome diagonal (for part $\\mathrm{BB}$, that is $\\mathrm{YY}$, and for $\\mathrm{BY}$ that is $\\mathrm{YB)}$.\n\n(ii) Let $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ be three distinct elements; then two of them can form a $2 \\times 2$ square with yellow diagonal, and two of them can form a $2 \\times 2$ square with blue diagonal (for all parts but $\\mathrm{BB}$, a pair (BY, YB) fits for both statements, while for all parts but BY, these pairs are $(\\mathrm{YB}, \\mathrm{YY})$ and $(\\mathrm{BB}, \\mathrm{YB}))$.\n\nNow, let $\\ell$ and $r$ be the numbers of distinct left and right parts of our 5 flags, respectively. The total number of flags is $5 \\leq r \\ell$, hence one of the factors (say, $r$ ) should be at least 3 . On the other hand, $\\ell, r \\leq 4$, so there are two flags with coinciding right part; let them be $L_{1} R_{1}$ and $L_{2} R_{1}\\left(L_{1} \\neq L_{2}\\right)$.\n\nNext, since $r \\geq 3$, there exist some flags $L_{3} R_{3}$ and $L_{4} R_{4}$ such that $R_{1}, R_{3}, R_{4}$ are distinct. Let $L^{\\prime} R^{\\prime}$ be the remaining flag. By (i), one of the pairs $\\left(L^{\\prime}, L_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left(L^{\\prime}, L_{2}\\right)$ can form a $2 \\times 2$ square with monochrome diagonal; we can assume that $L^{\\prime}, L_{2}$ form a square with a blue diagonal. Finally, the right parts of two of the flags $L_{1} R_{1}, L_{3} R_{3}, L_{4} R_{4}$ can also form a $2 \\times 2$ square with a blue diagonal by (ii). Putting these $2 \\times 2$ squares on the diagonal of a $4 \\times 4$ square, we find a desired arrangement of four flags.\n\nWe are ready to prove the problem statement by induction on $N$; actually, above we have proved the base case $N=4$. For the induction step, assume that $N>4$, consider any $2^{N-2}+1$ flags of length $N$, and arrange them into a large flag of size $\\left(2^{N-2}+1\\right) \\times N$. This flag contains a non-monochrome column since the flags are distinct; we may assume that this column is the first one. By the pigeonhole principle, this column contains at least $\\left\\lceil\\frac{2^{N-2}+1}{2}\\right\\rceil=2^{N-3}+1$ squares of one color (say, blue). We call the flags with a blue first square good.\n\nConsider all the good flags and remove the first square from each of them. We obtain at least $2^{N-3}+1 \\geq M_{N-1}$ flags of length $N-1$; by the induction hypothesis, $N-1$ of them\n\n\n\ncan form a square $Q$ with the monochrome diagonal. Now, returning the removed squares, we obtain a rectangle $(N-1) \\times N$, and our aim is to supplement it on the top by one more flag.\n\nIf $Q$ has a yellow diagonal, then we can take each flag with a yellow first square (it exists by a choice of the first column; moreover, it is not used in $Q$ ). Conversely, if the diagonal of $Q$ is blue then we can take any of the $\\geq 2^{N-3}+1-(N-1)>0$ remaining good flags. So, in both cases we get a desired $N \\times N$ square.", "We present a different proof of the estimate $M_{N} \\leq 2^{N-2}+1$. We do not use the induction, involving Hall's lemma on matchings instead.\n\nConsider arbitrary $2^{N-2}+1$ distinct flags and arrange them into a large $\\left(2^{N-2}+1\\right) \\times N$ flag. Construct two bipartite graphs $G_{\\mathrm{y}}=\\left(V \\cup V^{\\prime}, E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)$ and $G_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\left(V \\cup V^{\\prime}, E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)$ with the common set of vertices as follows. Let $V$ and $V^{\\prime}$ be the set of columns and the set of flags under consideration, respectively. Next, let the edge $(c, f)$ appear in $E_{\\mathrm{y}}$ if the intersection of column $c$ and flag $f$ is yellow, and $(c, f) \\in E_{\\mathrm{b}}$ otherwise. Then we have to prove exactly that one of the graphs $G_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and $G_{\\mathrm{b}}$ contains a matching with all the vertices of $V$ involved.\n\nAssume that these matchings do not exist. By Hall's lemma, it means that there exist two sets of columns $S_{\\mathrm{y}}, S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\subset V$ such that $\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|-1$ and $\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|-1$ (in the left-hand sides, $E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)$ denote respectively the sets of all vertices connected to $S_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{b}}$ in the corresponding graphs). Our aim is to prove that this is impossible. Note that $S_{\\mathrm{y}}, S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\neq V$ since $N \\leq 2^{N-2}+1$.\n\nFirst, suppose that $S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\neq \\varnothing$, so there exists some $c \\in S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}}$. Note that each flag is connected to $c$ either in $G_{\\mathrm{y}}$ or in $G_{\\mathrm{b}}$, hence $E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right) \\cup E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)=V^{\\prime}$. Hence we have $2^{N-2}+1=\\left|V^{\\prime}\\right| \\leq\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right|+\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|+\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|-2 \\leq 2 N-4$; this is impossible for $N \\geq 4$.\n\nSo, we have $S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}}=\\varnothing$. Let $y=\\left|S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right|, b=\\left|S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right|$. From the construction of our graph, we have that all the flags in the set $V^{\\prime \\prime}=V^{\\prime} \\backslash\\left(E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right) \\cup E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right)$ have blue squares in the columns of $S_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and yellow squares in the columns of $S_{\\mathrm{b}}$. Hence the only undetermined positions in these flags are the remaining $N-y-b$ ones, so $2^{N-y-b} \\geq\\left|V^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\geq\\left|V^{\\prime}\\right|-\\left|E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right)\\right|-\\left|E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)\\right| \\geq$ $2^{N-2}+1-(y-1)-(b-1)$, or, denoting $c=y+b, 2^{N-c}+c>2^{N-2}+2$.

Each block can contain not more than one king (otherwise these two kings would attack each other); hence, by the pigeonhole principle each block must contain exactly one king.\n\nNow assign to each block a letter $\\mathrm{T}$ or $\\mathrm{B}$ if a king is placed in its top or bottom half, respectively. Similarly, assign to each block a letter $\\mathrm{L}$ or $\\mathrm{R}$ if a king stands in its left or right half. So we define T-blocks, B-blocks, L-blocks, and $R$-blocks. We also combine the letters; we call a block $a T L$-block if it is simultaneously T-block and L-block. Similarly we define TR-blocks, $B L$-blocks, and BR-blocks. The arrangement of blocks determines uniquely the arrangement of kings; so in the rest of the solution we consider the $50 \\times 50$ system of blocks (see Fig. 1). We identify the blocks by their coordinate pairs; the pair $(i, j)$, where $1 \\leq i, j \\leq 50$, refers to the $j$ th block in the $i$ th row (or the $i$ th block in the $j$ th column).

In particular, the total number of L-blocks (or R-blocks, or T-blocks, or B-blocks) is equal to $25 \\cdot 50=1250$.\n\nConsider any B-block of the form $(1, j)$. By $\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, all blocks in the $j$ th column are B-blocks; so we call such a column $B$-column. By (ii'), we have 25 B-blocks in the first row, so we obtain 25 B-columns. These $25 \\mathrm{~B}$-columns contain $1250 \\mathrm{~B}$-blocks, hence all blocks in the remaining columns are T-blocks, and we obtain 25 T-columns.

Suppose that the $j$ th column is a T-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a Bcolumn. Consider some index $i$ such that the $i$ th row is an L-row; then $(i, j+1)$ is a BL-block. Therefore, $(i+1, j)$ cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence $(i+1, j)$ is a TL-block, thus the $(i+1)$ th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the $i$ th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the $i$ th to the 50th are L-rows. Since we have exactly 25 L-rows, it follows that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are R-rows, and the rows from the 26th to the 50th are L-rows.\n\nNow consider the neighboring R-row and L-row (that are the rows with numbers 25 and 26). Replacing in the previous reasoning rows by columns and vice versa, the columns from the 1 st to the 25th are T-columns, and the columns from the 26th to the 50th are B-columns.

We will also consider that two arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry are different.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraint that no two kings can capture each other.

This implies that the kings must be placed in a checkerboard-like pattern, but with a specific restriction due to the diagonal adjacency.\n\nGiven the \\(100 \\times 100\\) board, we can divide it into two types of squares: black and white. In a standard \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard, there are 5000 black squares and 5000 white squares.

Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ does not exceed $n / 2$.\n\nProof. This is obvious for $n=2$. Take $n$ with $2<n \\leq 1003$ and assume the claim to be true for every $\\mathcal{L}$ of length less than $n$. Let now $\\mathcal{L}$ (endpoints $A, B$ ) consist of $n$ segments. Let $P Q$ be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle $P Q S$ with all vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ is obtuse or right-angled; thus $S$ is the summit of $P Q S$. We may assume that the five points $A, P, S, Q, B$ lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ in this order and partition $\\mathcal{L}$ into four pieces $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}, \\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}, \\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$ (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of $P Q$, an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$. Therefore every iso-odd triangle within $\\mathcal{L}$ has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within $\\mathcal{L}$ other than $P Q S$ does not exceed $n / 2$. And since each of $\\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}$ consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a $1 / 2+1 / 2$ in excess. Hence the triangle $P S Q$ is also covered by the estimate $n / 2$. This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal $X Y$. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$ be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints $X, Y$ and let $X Y Z$ be the triangle in the dissection with vertex $Z$ not on $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$. Notice that $X Y Z$ is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments $X Z, Y Z$ would be longer than $X Y$. Denoting by $\\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ the two pieces defined by $Z$ and applying the lemma to each of $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}, \\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless $X Y Z$ is one of them. But in that case $X Z$ and $Y Z$ are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including $X Y Z$, is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes. This already gives us the required 1003 iso-odd triangles. Then we can complete the triangulation in an arbitrary fashion.", "Let the terms odd triangle and iso-odd triangle have the same meaning as in the first solution.\n\nLet $A B C$ be an iso-odd triangle, with $A B$ and $B C$ odd sides. This means that there are an odd number of sides of the 2006-gon between $A$ and $B$ and also between $B$ and $C$. We say that these sides belong to the iso-odd triangle $A B C$.\n\nAt least one side in each of these groups does not belong to any other iso-odd triangle. This is so because any odd triangle whose vertices are among the points between $A$ and $B$ has two sides of equal length and therefore has an even number of sides belonging to it in total. Eliminating all sides belonging to any other iso-odd triangle in this area must therefore leave one side that belongs to no other iso-odd triangle. Let us assign these two sides (one in each group) to the triangle $A B C$.\n\nTo each iso-odd triangle we have thus assigned a pair of sides, with no two triangles sharing an assigned side. It follows that at most 1003 iso-odd triangles can appear in the dissection.\n\nThis value can be attained, as shows the example from the first solution."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the diagonals and the triangles formed in a regular 2006-gon.

The third side must be even because the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.\n   - In a regular 2006-gon, the only even-length diagonals are those that skip an even number of vertices.\n\n5. **Counting Odd-Sided Diagonals:**\n   - There are 2006 vertices in the 2006-gon.\n   - The number of odd-length diagonals is equal to the number of odd-numbered vertices, which is 1003 (since every other vertex is odd).\n\n6. **Forming Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - To form an isosceles triangle with two odd sides, we need to choose two odd-length diagonals that share a common endpoint.\n   - Each odd-length diagonal can be paired with another odd-length diagonal that skips an even number of vertices to form an isosceles triangle.\n\n7. **Maximizing the Number of Isosceles Triangles:**\n   - Each odd-length diagonal can be paired with 1002 other odd-length diagonals (since there are 1003 odd-length diagonals and we exclude the diagonal itself).\n   - However, each pair is counted twice (once for each diagonal in the pair), so the number of unique pairs is \\( \\frac{1003 \\times 1002}{2} = 503503 \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is \\(\\boxed{503503}\\)."], "pred": ["503503"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

We distinguish two cases.\n\nCase 1: $X \\cap M_{1} \\neq \\varnothing$.\n\nA cube from $X \\cap M_{1}$ should appear in all three boxes $X, Y$, and $Z$, so it should lie in $X \\cap Y \\cap Z$.

Consider all the rays emerging at $O$ and passing through a point from $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$; number them as $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}$ in increasing order according to slope.

In fact, we will show that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nClearly, the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is symmetric in the line $y=x$. Denote by $D$ the convex hull of $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n3. We prove that the set $\\mathcal{D}$ contains all stable sets. Let $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ be a stable set (recall that it is assumed to be up-right closed and to have a finite complement in $\\mathcal{Q}$ ). Denote by $S$ its convex hull; clearly, the vertices of $S$ are lattice points. The boundary of $S$ consists of two rays (horizontal and vertical ones) along with some $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve for some set of lattice vectors $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\nClaim 1.

Let $\\ell$ be the supporting line of $S$ parallel to $\\vec{v}_{i}$ (i.e., $\\ell$ contains some point of $S$, and the set $S$ lies on one side of $\\ell$ ). Take any point $b \\in \\ell \\cap \\mathcal{S}$ and consider $N(b)$. The line $\\ell$ splits the set $N(b) \\backslash \\ell$ into two congruent parts, one having an empty intersection with $\\mathcal{S}$. Hence, in order for $b$ not to be lonely, at least half of the set $\\ell \\cap N(b)$ (which contains $2 k_{i}$ points) should lie in $S$. Thus, the boundary of $S$ contains a segment $\\ell \\cap S$ with at least $k_{i}+1$ lattice points (including $b$ ) on it; this segment corresponds to the required vector $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\n<img_3156>\n\nProof of Claim 1\n\n<img_3490>\n\nProof of Claim 2\n\nClaim 2. Each stable set $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Q}$ lies in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nProof. To show this, it suffices to prove that the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve lies in $D$, i.e., that all its vertices do so. Let $p^{\\prime}$ be an arbitrary vertex of the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve; $p^{\\prime}$ partitions this curve into two parts, $\\mathcal{X}$ (being down-right of $p$ ) and $\\mathcal{Y}$ (being up-left of $p$ ). The set $\\mathcal{V}$ is split now into two parts: $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ consisting of those $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ for which $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}$ corresponds to a segment in $\\mathcal{X}$, and a similar part $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Notice that the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve consists of several segments corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$, followed by those corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Hence there is a vertex $p$ of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve separating $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ from $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Claim 1 now yields that $p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p$, so $p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n4. $\\mathcal{D}$ is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of $r_{i}$; let $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ be the ray complementary to $r_{i}$. By our definitions, the set $N(O)$ contains no points between the rays $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$, as well as between $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $r_{i+1}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 3. In the set $\\mathcal{D}$, all lattice points of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are comfortable.\n\nProof. Let $p$ be any lattice point of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, belonging to some segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Draw the line $\\ell$ containing this segment. Then $\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ contains exactly $k_{i}+1$ lattice points, all of which lie in $N(p)$ except for $p$. Thus, exactly half of the points in $N(p) \\cap \\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to show that all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$ (recall that all the points below $\\ell$ lack this property).\n\n\n\nNotice that each vector in $\\mathcal{V}$ has one coordinate greater than $n / 2$; thus the neighborhood of $p$ contains parts of at most two segments of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve succeeding $d_{i} d_{i+1}$, as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by $r_{j}$ and $r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$ (with $i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2$ ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ which could lie outside $\\mathcal{D}$ lie in shifted angles between $r_{j}, r_{j+1}$ or $r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$. But those angles, restricted to $N(p)$, have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n<img_3487>\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of $\\mathcal{D}$ which are not on the boundary of $D$ are crowded.\n\nProof. Let $p \\in \\mathcal{D}$ be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point $p^{\\prime}$ on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of $N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ by $\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}$ is still in $\\mathcal{D}$, and $N(p)$ contains at least one more point of $\\mathcal{D}$ - either below or to the left of $p$. So, we may assume that $p$ lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Notice here that $d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)$.\n\nDraw a line $\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}$ through $p$, and draw a vertical line $h$ through $d_{i}$; see Figure below. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ be the parts of $\\mathcal{D}$ lying to the left and to the right of $h$, respectively (points of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap h$ lie in both parts).\n\n<img_3424>\n\nNotice that the vectors $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}$, and $\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}$ are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}$ still lies in $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}$. As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$, along with those on $\\ell$ to the left of $p$. Since $N(p)$ contains also $d_{i}$ and $d_{i+1}$, the point $p$ is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$, and have shown that the lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are exactly the comfortable points of $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$ (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$ contains $k_{i}$ lattice points different from $d_{i}$. Taken over all $i$, these points exhaust all the lattice points in the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, except for $d_{1}$, and thus the number of lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$. On the other hand, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$ is just the number of points in $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$, so it equals $n^{2}$.

Find all possible numbers of tangent segments when he stops drawing.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "6048", "unit": null, "solution": ["First, consider a particular arrangement of circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ where all the centers are aligned and each $C_{i}$ is eclipsed from the other circles by its neighbors - for example, taking $C_{i}$ with center $\\left(i^{2}, 0\\right)$ and radius $i / 2$ works. Then the only tangent segments that can be drawn are between adjacent circles $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+1}$, and exactly three segments can be drawn for each pair. So Luciano will draw exactly $3(n-1)$ segments in this case.\n\n<img_3497>\n\nFor the general case, start from a final configuration (that is, an arrangement of circles and segments in which no further segments can be drawn). The idea of the solution is to continuously resize and move the circles around the plane, one by one (in particular, making sure we never have 4 circles with a common tangent line), and show that the number of segments drawn remains constant as the picture changes. This way, we can reduce any circle/segment configuration to the particular one mentioned above, and the final number of segments must remain at $3 n-3$.\n\nSome preliminary considerations: look at all possible tangent segments joining any two circles. A segment that is tangent to a circle $A$ can do so in two possible orientations - it may come out of $A$ in clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Two segments touching the same circle with the same orientation will never intersect each other. Each pair $(A, B)$ of circles has 4 choices of tangent segments, which can be identified by their orientations - for example, $(A+, B-)$ would be the segment which comes out of $A$ in clockwise orientation and comes out of $B$ in counterclockwise orientation. In total, we have $2 n(n-1)$ possible segments, disregarding intersections.\n\nNow we pick a circle $C$ and start to continuously move and resize it, maintaining all existing tangent segments according to their identifications, including those involving $C$. We can keep our choice of tangent segments until the configuration reaches a transition. We lose nothing if we assume that $C$ is kept at least $\\varepsilon$ units away from any other circle, where $\\varepsilon$ is a positive, fixed constant; therefore at a transition either: (1) a currently drawn tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes obstructed; or (2) a currently absent tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes unobstructed and available.\n\nClaim. A transition can only occur when three circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ are tangent to a common line $\\ell$ containing $t$, in a way such that the three tangent segments lying on $\\ell$ (joining the three circles pairwise) are not obstructed by any other circles or tangent segments (other than $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ ). Proof. Since (2) is effectively the reverse of (1), it suffices to prove the claim for (1). Suppose $t$ has suddenly become obstructed, and let us consider two cases.\n\n\n\nCase 1: $t$ becomes obstructed by a circle\n\n<img_3256>\n\nThen the new circle becomes the third circle tangent to $\\ell$, and no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$.\n\nCase 2: $t$ becomes obstructed by another tangent segment $t^{\\prime}$ \n\nWhen two segments $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ first intersect each other, they must do so at a vertex of one of them. But if a vertex of $t^{\\prime}$ first crossed an interior point of $t$, the circle associated to this vertex was already blocking $t$ (absurd), or is about to (we already took care of this in case 1). So we only have to analyze the possibility of $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ suddenly having a common vertex. However, if that happens, this vertex must belong to a single circle (remember we are keeping different circles at least $\\varepsilon$ units apart from each other throughout the moving/resizing process), and therefore they must have different orientations with respect to that circle.\n<img_4010>\n\nThus, at the transition moment, both $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ are tangent to the same circle at a common point, that is, they must be on the same line $\\ell$ and hence we again have three circles simultaneously tangent to $\\ell$. Also no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$ or $t^{\\prime}$ (otherwise, they would have disappeared before this transition).\n\nNext, we focus on the maximality of a configuration immediately before and after a transition, where three circles share a common tangent line $\\ell$. Let the three circles be $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$, ordered by their tangent points. The only possibly affected segments are the ones lying on $\\ell$, namely $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$. Since $C_{2}$ is in the middle, $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ must have different orientations with respect to $C_{2}$. For $C_{1}, t_{12}$ and $t_{13}$ must have the same orientation, while for $C_{3}, t_{13}$ and $t_{23}$ must have the same orientation. The figure below summarizes the situation, showing alternative positions for $C_{1}$ (namely, $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ ) and for $C_{3}\\left(C_{3}\\right.$ and $C_{3}^{\\prime}$ ).\n\n<img_3756>\n\n\n\nNow perturb the diagram slightly so the three circles no longer have a common tangent, while preserving the definition of $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$ according to their identifications. First note that no other circles or tangent segments can obstruct any of these segments. Also recall that tangent segments joining the same circle at the same orientation will never obstruct each other.\n\nThe availability of the tangent segments can now be checked using simple diagrams.\n\nCase 1: $t_{13}$ passes through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3220>\n\nIn this case, $t_{13}$ is not available, but both $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ are.\n\nCase 2: $t_{13}$ does not pass through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3461>\n\nNow $t_{13}$ is available, but $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ obstruct each other, so only one can be drawn.\n\nIn any case, exactly 2 out of these 3 segments can be drawn. Thus the maximal number of segments remains constant as we move or resize the circles, and we are done.", "First note that all tangent segments lying on the boundary of the convex hull of the circles are always drawn since they do not intersect anything else. Now in the final picture, aside from the $n$ circles, the blackboard is divided into regions. We can consider the picture as a plane (multi-)graph $G$ in which the circles are the vertices and the tangent segments are the edges. The idea of this solution is to find a relation between the number of edges and the number of regions in $G$; then, once we prove that $G$ is connected, we can use Euler's formula to finish the problem.\n\nThe boundary of each region consists of 1 or more (for now) simple closed curves, each made of arcs and tangent segments. The segment and the arc might meet smoothly (as in $S_{i}$, $i=1,2, \\ldots, 6$ in the figure below) or not (as in $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$; call such points sharp corners of the boundary). In other words, if a person walks along the border, her direction would suddenly turn an angle of $\\pi$ at a sharp corner.\n\n\n\n<img_3559>\n\nClaim 1. The outer boundary $B_{1}$ of any internal region has at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Let a person walk one lap along $B_{1}$ in the counterclockwise orientation. As she does so, she will turn clockwise as she moves along the circle arcs, and not turn at all when moving along the lines. On the other hand, her total rotation after one lap is $2 \\pi$ in the counterclockwise direction! Where could she be turning counterclockwise? She can only do so at sharp corners, and, even then, she turns only an angle of $\\pi$ there. But two sharp corners are not enough, since at least one arc must be present - so she must have gone through at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nClaim 2. Each internal region is simply connected, that is, has only one boundary curve.\n\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that some region has an outer boundary $B_{1}$ and inner boundaries $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{m}(m \\geqslant 2)$. Let $P_{1}$ be one of the sharp corners of $B_{1}$.\n\nNow consider a car starting at $P_{1}$ and traveling counterclockwise along $B_{1}$. It starts in reverse, i.e., it is initially facing the corner $P_{1}$. Due to the tangent conditions, the car may travel in a way so that its orientation only changes when it is moving along an arc. In particular, this means the car will sometimes travel forward. For example, if the car approaches a sharp corner when driving in reverse, it would continue travel forward after the corner, instead of making an immediate half-turn. This way, the orientation of the car only changes in a clockwise direction since the car always travels clockwise around each arc.\n\nNow imagine there is a laser pointer at the front of the car, pointing directly ahead. Initially, the laser endpoint hits $P_{1}$, but, as soon as the car hits an arc, the endpoint moves clockwise around $B_{1}$. In fact, the laser endpoint must move continuously along $B_{1}$ ! Indeed, if the endpoint ever jumped (within $B_{1}$, or from $B_{1}$ to one of the inner boundaries), at the moment of the jump the interrupted laser would be a drawable tangent segment that Luciano missed (see figure below for an example).\n\n<img_3484>\n\n\n\nNow, let $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ be the next two sharp corners the car goes through, after $P_{1}$ (the previous lemma assures their existence). At $P_{2}$ the car starts moving forward, and at $P_{3}$ it will start to move in reverse again. So, at $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint is at $P_{3}$ itself. So while the car moved counterclockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint moved clockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$. That means the laser beam itself scanned the whole region within $B_{1}$, and it should have crossed some of the inner boundaries.\n\nClaim 3. Each region has exactly 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Consider again the car of the previous claim, with its laser still firmly attached to its front, traveling the same way as before and going through the same consecutive sharp corners $P_{1}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$. As we have seen, as the car goes counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint goes clockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, so together they cover the whole boundary. If there were a fourth sharp corner $P_{4}$, at some moment the laser endpoint would pass through it. But, since $P_{4}$ is a sharp corner, this means the car must be on the extension of a tangent segment going through $P_{4}$. Since the car is not on that segment itself (the car never goes through $P_{4}$ ), we would have 3 circles with a common tangent line, which is not allowed.\n\n<img_3207>\n\nWe are now ready to finish the solution. Let $r$ be the number of internal regions, and $s$ be the number of tangent segments. Since each tangent segment contributes exactly 2 sharp corners to the diagram, and each region has exactly 3 sharp corners, we must have $2 s=3 r$. Since the graph corresponding to the diagram is connected, we can use Euler's formula $n-s+r=1$ and find $s=3 n-3$ and $r=2 n-2$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Geometry", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to understand the constraints and the nature of the tangent segments that can be drawn between the circles.

We claim that the required partition exists and is unique. The two diagonals of the board divide the board into four regions. Note that the domino covering cell $(1,1)$ must be vertical. This in turn shows that each domino covering $(2,2),(3,3), \\ldots,(n, n)$ is vertical. By induction, the dominoes in the left region are all vertical. By rotational symmetry, the dominoes in the bottom region are horizontal, and so on. This shows that the partition exists and is unique.\n<img_3889>\n\nIt remains to show that this value of $k$ is the smallest possible. Assume that only $k<2 n$ cells are marked, and there exists a partition $P$ satisfying the requirement. It suffices to show there exists another desirable partition distinct from $P$. Let $d$ be the main diagonal of the board.\n\nConstruct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of $P$. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in $d$ are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1 . Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2).\n\nConsider any cell $c$ lying on the diagonal $d$. Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to $d$. Thus they connect $c$ to different cells. This shows $c$ belongs to a cycle $C(c)$ of length at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle $c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{m}$ where $c_{0}=c$ and $m$ is the least positive integer such that $c_{m}$ lies on $d$. Clearly, $c_{m}$ is distinct from $c$. From the construction, the path symmetrical to this with respect to $d$ also lies in the graph, and so these paths together form $C(c)$. Hence, $C(c)$ contains exactly two cells from $d$.

The binary representation of 2020 is $2020=\\overline{11111100100}_{2}$, so $S_{2}(2020)=7$, and the answer follows.\n\nA strategy for A. At any round, while possible, A chooses two equal nonzero numbers on the board. Clearly, while $A$ can make such choice, the game does not terminate. On the other hand, $A$ can follow this strategy unless the game has already terminated. Indeed, if $A$ always chooses two equal numbers, then each number appearing on the board is either 0 or a power of 2 with non-negative integer exponent, this can be easily proved using induction on the number of rounds. At the moment when $A$ is unable to follow the strategy all nonzero numbers on the board are distinct powers of 2 . If the board contains at least one such power, then the largest of those powers is greater than the sum of the others. Otherwise there are only zeros on the blackboard, in both cases the game terminates.\n\nFor every number on the board, define its range to be the number of ones it is obtained from. We can prove by induction on the number of rounds that for any nonzero number $k$ written by $B$ its range is $k$, and for any zero written by $B$ its range is a power of 2 . Thus at the end of each round all the ranges are powers of two, and their sum is $n$. Since $S_{2}(a+b) \\leqslant S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, the number $n$ cannot be represented as a sum of less than $S_{2}(n)$ powers of 2 . Thus at the end of each round the board contains at least $S_{2}(n)$ numbers, while $A$ follows the above strategy. So $A$ can guarantee at least $S_{2}(n)$ cookies for himself.\n\nA strategy for $B$.

An appropriate strategy for $B$ can be explained as follows: Perform a move so that the situation remains good, while it is possible. We intend to show that in this case $B$ will not lose more than $S_{2}(n)$ cookies. For this purpose, we prove several lemmas.\n\nFor a positive integer $k$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(k)$ the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. Recall that, by Legendre's formula, $\\nu_{2}(n !)=n-S_{2}(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. The initial situation is good.\n\nProof. In the initial configuration, the number of balanced collections is equal to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ n / 2\\end{array}\\right)$. We have\n\n$$\n\\nu_{2}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn \\\\\nn / 2\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)=\\nu_{2}(n !)-2 \\nu_{2}((n / 2) !)=\\left(n-S_{2}(n)\\right)-2\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-S_{2}(n / 2)\\right)=S_{2}(n)=s\n$$\n\nHence $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections, as desired.\n\nLemma 2. B may play so that after each round the situation remains good.\n\nProof. Assume that the situation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ before a round is good, and that $A$ erases two numbers, $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of all balanced collections, $N_{+}$be the number of those having $\\varepsilon_{p}=\\varepsilon_{q}$, and $N_{-}$be the number of other balanced collections. Then $N=N_{+}+N_{-}$. Now, if $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $x_{p}+x_{q}$, then the number of balanced collections will become $N_{+}$. If $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $\\left|x_{p}-x_{q}\\right|$, then this number will become $N_{-}$. Since $2^{s+1}$ does not divide $N$, it does not divide one of the summands $N_{+}$and $N_{-}$, hence $B$ can reach a good situation after the round.\n\nLemma 3. Assume that the game terminates at a good situation. Then the board contains at most $s$ numbers.\n\nProof. Suppose, one of the numbers is greater than the sum of the other numbers. Then the number of balanced collections is 0 and hence divisible by $2^{s+1}$. Therefore, the situation is not good.\n\nThen we have only zeros on the blackboard at the moment when the game terminates. If there are $k$ of them, then the number of balanced collections is $2^{k}$. Since the situation is good, we have $k \\leqslant s$.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, $B$ may act in such way that they keep the situation good.

After those $a$ moves, the $a$ coins flipped in those moves are all heads, as is the coin the machine is now at, so at least the next $a+1$ moves will all be moves to the previous coin.

This certainly determines a unique configuration of coins that could possibly correspond to the given sequence. Furthermore, every coin flipped as part of the $a_{j}$ consecutive moves is also flipped as part of all subsequent sequences of $a_{k}$ consecutive moves, for all $k>j$, meaning that, as we follow the moves backwards, each coin is always in the correct state when flipped to result in a move in the required direction. (Alternatively, since there are $2^{n}$ possible configurations of coins and $2^{n}$ possible such ascending sequences, the fact that the sequence of moves determines at most one configuration of coins, and thus that there is an injection from configurations of coins to such ascending sequences, is sufficient for it to be a bijection, without needing to show that coins are in the right state as we move backwards.)", "We explicitly describe what happens with an arbitrary sequence $C$ of $n$ coins.

The process stops when there are no coins showing heads. The number of steps \\(\\ell(C)\\) is the number of times this flipping operation is performed.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of the Process\nThe key observation is that the process is deterministic and will always terminate because the number of heads can never increase indefinitely.

When placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ wall, it intersects each of the $n-1$ other walls exactly once and hence splits each of $n$ of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields $\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1\\right)+n=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, proving the claim.\n\nNow let $G$ be the graph with vertices given by the $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.\n\nWe now show that no matter how Merlin paints the $n$ walls, Morgana can place at least $n+1$ knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in $G$.

If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of $G$, then no two knights can ever meet.\n\nNow we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most $n+1$ knights.\n\nFirst, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and $n$.\n\nWe claim that, for each $i$, the regions labelled $i$ are connected by doors. First, we note that for each $i$ with $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ there is a unique region labelled $i$ which is unbounded to the north.\n\nNow, consider a knight placed in some region with label $i$, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label $i$.\n\nEventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label $i$. Hence every region with label $i$ is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label $i$ are connected to each other.\n\nAs a result, there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, and Morgana can place at most $n+1$ knights.", "We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than $n+1$ knights.\n\nMerlin starts by building a labyrinth of $n$ walls of his own design. He places walls in turn with increasing positive gradients, placing each so far to the right that all intersection points of previously-placed lines lie to the left of it. He paints each in such a way that blue is on the left and red is on the right.\n\nFor example, here is a possible sequence of four such lines $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$ :\n\n<img_3427>\n\nWe say that a region is \"on the right\" if it has $x$-coordinate unbounded above (note that if we only have one wall, then both regions are on the right). We claim inductively that, after placing $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.\n\nWhen placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ line, it then cuts every one of the $n-1$ previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the $n$ regions on the right.\n\n<img_3985>\n\nThe addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have $n+1$ connected components.\n\nHaving built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.\n\n\n\nThe only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:\n<img_3360>\n\nNote that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).\n\nHowever, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur's actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most $n+1$ knights."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the value of \\( k(\\mathfrak{L}) \\) for a labyrinth \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) with \\( n \\) walls, we need to analyze the structure and connectivity of the labyrinth.

If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes. First, Bob makes a $k$-move (splits the $2 k$ boxes into two groups of $k$ boxes each). Without loss of generality, Alice picks the left group. Then Bob makes a $(k+1)$-move, ... a $(2 k-1)$-move.

For each of Bob's $N-1$ possible choices, consider the subset of rounds in which he makes that choice. In that subset of rounds, Alice alternates between picking the left group and picking the right group; the first time Bob makes that choice, Alice picks the group containing the $K^{\\text {th }}$ box. Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times.

Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side.

Now provided that $f$ is injective, (2) tells us that $f$ is the successor function.

A straightforward induction using (2) in the induction step reveals that we have $f(a+n)=f(b+n)$ for all nonnegative integers $n$.

It follows from (2) that $\\angle B C A=\\angle M T A=\\angle B Q P=\\angle B M P$ (see Figure 2). Thus, $P Q \\| A C$ and $P M \\| A T$. Hence, $B S / B M=B P / B A=B M / B T$, so $B T^{2}=2 B M^{2}$ and $B T=\\sqrt{2} B M$.\n\n<img_3695>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_4019>\n\nFigure 2", "Again, we denote by $\\Omega$ the circumcircle of the triangle $A B C$.\n\nChoose the points $X$ and $Y$ on the rays $B A$ and $B C$ respectively, so that $\\angle M X B=\\angle M B C$ and $\\angle B Y M=\\angle A B M$ (see Figure 4).

If we would have $a=1$, then both $b-c$ and $c-b$ were powers of 2 , which is impossible since their sum is zero; because of symmetry, this argument shows $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$.\n\nCase 1. Among $a, b$, and $c$ there are at least two equal numbers.\n\nWithout loss of generality we may suppose that $a=b$. Then $a^{2}-c$ and $a(c-1)$ are powers of 2. The latter tells us that actually $a$ and $c-1$ are powers of 2 . So there are nonnegative integers $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ with $a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $c=2^{\\gamma}+1$. Since $a^{2}-c=2^{2 \\alpha}-2^{\\gamma}-1$ is a power of 2 and thus incongruent to -1 modulo 4 , we must have $\\gamma \\leqslant 1$. Moreover, each of the terms $2^{2 \\alpha}-2$ and $2^{2 \\alpha}-3$ can only be a power of 2 if $\\alpha=1$. It follows that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,2)$ or $(2,2,3)$.\n\nCase 2.

Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\\gamma>0$. Then $c$ is even by (4) and, similarly, $b$ is even by (5) and (3). So the left-hand side of (2) is congruent to 2 modulo 4 , which is only possible if $b c=4$. As this contradicts (1), we have thereby shown that $\\gamma=0$, i.e., that $c=2 b-1$.\n\nNow (3) yields $3 b-2=2^{\\beta}$. Due to $b>2$ this is only possible if $\\beta \\geqslant 4$. If $\\beta=4$, then we get $b=6$ and $c=2 \\cdot 6-1=11$, which is a solution. It remains to deal with the case $\\beta \\geqslant 5$. Now (2) implies\n\n$$\n9 \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}=9 b(2 b-1)-18=(3 b-2)(6 b+1)-16=2^{\\beta}\\left(2^{\\beta+1}+5\\right)-16,\n$$\n\nand by $\\beta \\geqslant 5$ the right-hand side is not divisible by 32 .

On the other hand, $2^{\\beta}=a c-b>$ $(a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c$ implies in view of (1) that $a$ and $b$ are smaller than $2^{\\beta-1}$. All this is only possible if $\\vartheta=1$ and $a+b=2^{\\beta-1}$. Now (3) yields\n\n$$\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhence $4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b$, which in turn yields $a=3$.\n\nSo (6) simplifies to $c=b+2$ and (2) tells us that $b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)$ is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors $b-1$ and $b+3$ are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if $b=5$ and thus $c=7$. Thereby the solution is complete.", "As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$. Depending on the parities of $a, b$, and $c$ we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are even.\n\nLet $2^{A}, 2^{B}$, and $2^{C}$ be the largest powers of 2 dividing $a, b$, and $c$ respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that $1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C$. Now $2^{B}$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $a c-b$, whence $a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b$. Similarly, we deduce $b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a$. Adding both estimates we get $(a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)$, whence $c \\leqslant 2$. So $c=2$ and thus $A=B=C=1$; moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., $a=2^{A}=2$ and $b=2^{B}=2$. We have thereby found the solution $(a, b, c)=(2,2,2)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are odd.\n\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say $a=b$, then $a c-b=a(c-1)$ has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2 . Hence $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that $a<b<c$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denote the nonnegative integers for which $b c-a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $a c-b=2^{\\beta}$ hold. Clearly, we have $\\alpha>\\beta$, and thus $2^{\\beta}$ divides\n\n$$\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is odd, it is not possible that both factors $b+a$ and $b-a$ are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of $2^{\\beta-1}$. Hence one of the numbers $2(b+a)$ and $2(b-a)$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and in either case we have\n\n$$\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b) .\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nThis in turn yields $(a-1) b<a c-b<4 b$ and thus $a=3$ (recall that $a$ is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn $c \\leqslant b+2$. But due to the parity $b<c$ entails that $b+2 \\leqslant c$ holds as well. So we get $c=b+2$ and from $b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)$ being a power of 2 it follows that $b=5$ and $c=7$.\n\nCase 3. Among $a, b$, and $c$ both parities occur.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that $c$ is odd and that $a \\leqslant b$. We are to show that $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,3)$ or $(2,6,11)$. As at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even, the expression $a b-c$ is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n$$\na b-c=1 \\text {. }\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nIf $a=b$, then $c=a^{2}-1$, and from $a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)$ being a power of 2 it follows that both $a$ and $a^{2}-2$ are powers of 2 , whence $a=2$. This gives rise to the solution $(2,2,3)$.\n\n\n\nWe may suppose $a<b$ from now on. As usual, we let $\\alpha>\\beta$ denote the integers satisfying\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}=b c-a \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}=a c-b\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta=0$ it would follow that $a c-b=a b-c=1$ and hence that $b=c=1$, which is absurd. So $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ are positive and consequently $a$ and $b$ are even. Substituting $c=a b-1$ into (9) we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}  =a b^{2}-(a+b), \\tag{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}  =a^{2} b-(a+b) .\n\\tag{11}\n$$\n\nThe addition of both equation yields $2^{\\alpha}+2^{\\beta}=(a b-2)(a+b)$. Now $a b-2$ is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing $a+b$ is $2^{\\beta-1}$. For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers $a b^{2}$ and $a^{2} b$ is likewise $2^{\\beta-1}$. Thus there is an integer $\\tau \\geqslant 1$ together with odd integers $A, B$, and $C$ such that $a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C$, and $\\beta=1+3 \\tau$.\n\nNotice that $A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C$. Moreover, (11) entails $A^{2} B-C=2$. Thus $8=$ $4 A^{2} B-4 C \\geqslant 4 A^{2} B-A-B \\geqslant A^{2}(3 B-1)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are odd with $A<B$, this is only possible if $A=1$ and $B=3$. Finally, one may conclude $C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6$, and $c=11$. We have thereby found the triple $(2,6,11)$. This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution.

It remains to show the converse.\n\nAssume that $f$ is a function satisfying the problem condition. Notice that the function $g(x)=f(x)-f(0)$ also satisfies this condition. Replacing $f$ by $g$, we assume from now on that $f(0)=0$; then $f(n)>0$ for any positive integer $n$. Thus, we aim to prove that there exists a positive integer $a$ with $\\mho(a)=0$ such that $f(n)=a n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe start by introducing some notation. Set $N=10^{100}$. We say that a prime $p$ is large if $p>N$, and $p$ is small otherwise; let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all small primes. Next, we say that a positive integer is large or small if all its prime factors are such (thus, the number 1 is the unique number which is both large and small). For a positive integer $k$, we denote the greatest large divisor of $k$ and the greatest small divisor of $k$ by $L(k)$ and $S(k)$, respectively; thus, $k=L(k) S(k)$.\n\nWe split the proof into three steps.\n\nStep 1. We prove that for every large $k$, we have $k|f(a)-f(b) \\Longleftrightarrow k| a-b$. In other $\\overline{\\text { words, }} L(f(a)-f(b))=L(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$.\n\nWe use induction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is trivial. For the induction step, assume that $k_{0}$ is a large number, and that the statement holds for all large numbers $k$ with $k<k_{0}$.\n\nClaim 1. For any integers $x$ and $y$ with $0<x-y<k_{0}$, the number $k_{0}$ does not divide $f(x)-f(y)$.\n\nProof. Assume, to the contrary, that $k_{0} \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Let $\\ell=L(x-y)$; then $\\ell \\leqslant x-y<k_{0}$. By the induction hypothesis, $\\ell \\mid f(x)-f(y)$, and thus $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Notice that $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)$ is large, and $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\geqslant k_{0}>\\ell$.

By Claim 1, for every integer $a$ each of the sequences\n\n$$\nf(a), f(a+1), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}-1\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a+1), f(a+2), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nforms a complete residue system modulo $k_{0}$. This yields $f(a) \\equiv f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. Thus, $f(a) \\equiv f(b)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ whenever $a \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, if $a \\not \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ then there exists an integer $b^{\\prime}$ such that $b^{\\prime} \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ and $\\left|a-b^{\\prime}\\right|<k_{0}$. Then $f(b) \\equiv f\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right) \\not \\equiv f(a)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. The induction step is proved.\n\nStep 2. We prove that for some small integer a there exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that $\\overline{f(n)}=$ an. In other words, $f$ is linear on some infinite set.\n\nWe start with the following general statement.\n\n\n\nClaim 2. There exists a constant $c$ such that $f(t)<c t$ for every positive integer $t>N$.\n\nProof. Let $d$ be the product of all small primes, and let $\\alpha$ be a positive integer such that $2^{\\alpha}>f(N)$. Then, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ the numbers $f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(N)$ are distinct modulo $p^{\\alpha}$. Set $P=d^{\\alpha}$ and $c=P+f(N)$.\n\nChoose any integer $t>N$. Due to the choice of $\\alpha$, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ there exists at most one nonnegative integer $i \\leqslant N$ with $p^{\\alpha} \\mid f(t)-f(i)$. Since $|\\mathcal{S}|<N$, we can choose a nonnegative integer $j \\leqslant N$ such that $p^{\\alpha} \\nmid f(t)-f(j)$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Therefore, $S(f(t)-f(j))<P$.\n\nOn the other hand, Step 1 shows that $L(f(t)-f(j))=L(t-j) \\leqslant t-j$. Since $0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant N$, this yields\n\n$$\nf(t)=f(j)+L(f(t)-f(j)) \\cdot S(f(t)-f(j))<f(N)+(t-j) P \\leqslant(P+f(N)) t=c t\n$$\n\nNow let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of large primes. For every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, Step 1 implies $L(f(t))=t$, so the ratio $f(t) / t$ is an integer. Now Claim 2 leaves us with only finitely many choices for this ratio, which means that there exists an infinite subset $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and a positive integer $a$ such that $f(t)=a t$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, as required.\n\nSince $L(t)=L(f(t))=L(a) L(t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, we get $L(a)=1$, so the number $a$ is small.\n\nStep 3. We show that $f(x)=$ ax for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $R_{i}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x \\equiv i(\\bmod N !)\\}$ denote the residue class of $i$ modulo $N !$.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that for some $r$, there are infinitely many $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=a n$. Then $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{r+1}$.\n\nProof. Choose any $x \\in R_{r+1}$. By our assumption, we can select $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=$ an and $|n-x|>|f(x)-a x|$. Since $n-x \\equiv r-(r+1)=-1(\\bmod N !)$, the number $|n-x|$ is large. Therefore, by Step 1 we have $f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod n-x)$, so $n-x \\mid f(x)-a x$. Due to the choice of $n$, this yields $f(x)=a x$.\n\nTo complete Step 3, notice that the set $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ found in Step 2 contains infinitely many elements of some residue class $R_{i}$.

As these two conditions cannot be met at the same time, we have indeed $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$.\n\nTo show that $P(0)=1$ is possible as well, we verify that the polynomial $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ satisfies (1).

Now we show that no values other than those mentioned in the answer are possible for $P(0)$. To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Considering just the equivalence of the first and third statement and taking into account that $y^{2}$ may vary through $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}$ we infer that\n\n$$\n[P(x)-2|x|, P(x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}=[P(-x)-2|x|, P(-x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd.

In view of the fact that $a>0$ this is only possible if $a=1$. Finally, substituting $y=x+1$ with $x>0$ into (1) we get\n\n$$\n|2 x+1-b| \\leqslant 2 x \\Longleftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \\leqslant 2 x+2,\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nb \\in[1,4 x+1] \\Longleftrightarrow b \\in[-4 x-3,1]\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$.

We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, while $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value $b_{1}=x, B$ wins, while for some other value $b_{1}=y, A$ wins.\n\nWrite $B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$ be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in $B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A$. For any set $M$, let $M \\pm \\varepsilon$ be the set obtained by adding/subtracting $\\varepsilon$ to all elements of $M$. By our choice of $\\varepsilon$, the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{y} \\cup A$, while the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{x} \\cup A$.

In either case, we obtain\n\n$$\nA \\prec B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon<A,\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts condition 3 .\n\nSo we know now that the winner does not depend on $a_{1}, b_{1}$. Therefore, we can define a new rule $<^{*}$ on sets of cardinality $n-1$ by saying that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if $A \\cup\\{a\\} \\prec B \\cup\\{b\\}$ for some $a, b$ (or equivalently, all $a, b$ ) such that $a<\\min A, b<\\min B$ and $A \\cup\\{a\\}$ and $B \\cup\\{b\\}$ are disjoint.

It is easy to see that $\\prec^{\\circ}$ defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some $i, A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-A$ is greater than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-B$.

Fix a value of $x$ and note that for $y>x$ we must have $x f(x)+y f(x)>x f(y)+y f(x)>2$ (using that $f$ is decreasing for the first step), hence $f(x)>\\frac{2}{x+y}$.

Moreover, because $y$ is the only positive real number such that $(g(y), y)$ is a good pair and $x \\neq y$, we have $x f(g(y))+g(y) f(x)>$ 2.

Because $g(y)$ and $f(g(y))$ are both positive while $x-y$ is negative, it follows that $f(y)<f(x)$, showing that $f$ is decreasing.\n\nWe now prove Lemma 1 using Lemma 2. Suppose that $x \\neq y$ but $x f(y)+y f(x) \\leqslant 2$. As in the first solution, we get $x f(x)+x f(x)>2$ and $y f(y)+y f(y)>2$, which implies $x f(x)+y f(y)>2$. Now\n\n$$\nx f(x)+y f(y)>2 \\geqslant x f(y)+y f(x)\n$$\n\nimplies $(x-y)(f(x)-f(y))>0$, which contradicts the fact that $f$ is decreasing.

Hence Lucy can produce the tuple $\\mathbf{1}=(1, \\ldots, 1)$ as $\\mathbf{d}(1) \\vee \\cdots \\vee \\mathbf{d}(n)$.\n\nShe can then produce the constant tuple $\\mathbf{0}=(0, \\ldots, 0)$ as $\\mathbf{1}+\\mathbf{c}$, and for any $1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant n$ she can then produce the tuple $\\mathbf{e}(j)$ as $\\mathbf{d}(j) \\vee \\mathbf{0}$. Since she can now produce $\\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$ and already had $\\mathbf{c}$, she can (as we argued earlier) produce any integer-valued tuple.\n\n\n\n**Two tuples do not suffice.** We start with an observation: Let $a$ be a non-negative real number and suppose that two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ satisfy $\\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$ for some $1 \\leqslant j, k \\leqslant n$. Then we claim that the same inequality holds for $\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{v} \\vee \\mathbf{w}$ : Indeed, the property for the sum is verified by an easy computation:\n\n$$\n(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})_{j}=\\mathbf{v}_{j}+\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}+a \\mathbf{w}_{k}=a(\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w})_{k}\n$$\n\nFor the second operation, we denote by $\\mathbf{m}$ the tuple $\\mathbf{v} \\vee \\mathbf{w}$. Then $\\mathbf{m}_{j} \\geqslant \\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{m}_{j} \\geqslant \\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$. Since $\\mathbf{m}_{k}=\\mathbf{v}_{k}$ or $\\mathbf{m}_{k}=\\mathbf{w}_{k}$, the observation follows.\n\nAs a consequence of this observation we have that if all starting tuples satisfy such an inequality, then all generated tuples will also satisfy it, and so we would not be able to obtain every integer-valued tuple.\n\nLet us now prove that Lucy needs at least three starting tuples. For contradiction, let us suppose that Lucy started with only two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$. We are going to distinguish two cases. In the first case, suppose we can find a coordinate $i$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{i} \\geqslant 0$. Both operations preserve the sign, thus we can not generate any tuple that has negative $i$-th coordinate. Similarly for $\\mathbf{v}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{i} \\leqslant 0$.\n\nSuppose the opposite, i.e., for every $i$ we have either $\\mathbf{v}_{i}>0>\\mathbf{w}_{i}$, or $\\mathbf{v}_{i}<0<\\mathbf{w}_{i}$. Since we assumed that our tuples have at least three coordinates, by pigeonhole principle there exist two coordinates $j \\neq k$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_{j}$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j}$ has the same sign as $\\mathbf{w}_{k}$ (because there are only two possible combinations of signs).\n\nWithout loss of generality assume that $\\mathbf{v}_{j}, \\mathbf{v}_{k}>0$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j}, \\mathbf{w}_{k}<0$. Let us denote the positive real number $\\mathbf{v}_{j} / \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ by $a$. If $\\mathbf{w}_{j} / \\mathbf{w}_{k} \\leqslant a$, then both inequalities $\\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$ are satisfied. On the other hand, if $\\mathbf{w}_{j} / \\mathbf{w}_{k} \\leqslant a$, then both $\\mathbf{v}_{k} \\geqslant(1 / a) \\mathbf{v}_{j}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{k} \\geqslant(1 / a) \\mathbf{w}_{j}$ are satisfied.

This suggests that we need at least 2023 starting tuples to generate any 2022-tuple. Here's why:\n\n1. We need at least one tuple that can generate any integer in the range \\([-1011, 1011]\\) when combined with the other tuples using the \\(\\mathbf{v} \\vee \\mathbf{w}\\) operation.\n2.

We will thus look for the minimal possible value of the sum of all entries in $B$.\n\nWe note that any well has just one good path ending in it, consisting of just the well, and that any other field has the number of good paths ending in it equal to the sum of this quantity for all the adjacent fields with smaller values, since a good path can only come into the field from a field of lower value. Therefore, if we fill in the fields in $B$ in increasing order with respect to their values in $A$, it follows that each field not adjacent to any already filled field will receive a 1, while each field adjacent to already filled fields will receive the sum of the numbers already written on these adjacent fields.\n\nWe note that there is at least one well in $A$, that corresponding with the field with the entry 1 in $A$. Hence, the sum of values of fields in $B$ corresponding to wells in $A$ is at least 1 . We will now try to minimize the sum of the non-well entries, i.e. of the entries in $B$ corresponding to the non-wells in $A$. We note that we can ascribe to each pair of adjacent fields the value of the lower assigned number and that the sum of non-well entries will then equal to the sum of the ascribed numbers. Since the lower number is still at least 1, the sum of non-well entries will at least equal the number of pairs of adjacent fields, which is $2 n(n-1)$. Hence, the total minimum sum of entries in $B$ is at least $2 n(n-1)+1=2 n^{2}-2 n+1$. The necessary conditions for the minimum to be achieved is for there to be only one well and for no two entries in $B$ larger than 1 to be adjacent to each other.\n\nWe will now prove that the lower limit of $2 n^{2}-2 n+1$ entries can be achieved. This amounts to finding a way of marking a certain set of squares, those that have a value of 1 in $B$, such that no two unmarked squares are adjacent and that the marked squares form a connected tree with respect to adjacency.\n\nFor $n=1$ and $n=2$ the markings are respectively the lone field and the L-trimino.

For each considered field $(i, j)$ we will mark all squares of the form $(l, j)$ for $l>i$ and $(i+2 k, j \\pm 1)$.

By Claim 3, we get $a_{n-i} \\geqslant m_{n-k}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. Summing these $k$ inequalities we obtain\n\n$$\nS(n, k) \\geqslant k m_{n-k}=k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nThe second inequality in (1) is proved similarly. Indeed, this inequality is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(n-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n, n-1) & \\Longleftrightarrow(n-k-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n-k, n-k-1) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\leqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k-1)}{n-k-1}=k M_{n-k} ;\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthe last inequality follows again from Claim 3, as each term in $S(n, k)$ is at most $M_{n-k}$.\n\nNow we can prove the required estimate for $a_{2018}-a_{2017}$.

If we color the squares of the chessboard in a checkerboard pattern (alternating black and white), we can see that no two knights can be placed on squares of the same color.

From an $A$-cell the rook has to move to a $B$-cell or a $C$-cell. In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color. There are only $499^{2} A$-cells.

Furthermore, $\\angle K I E=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle C B A+\\frac{1}{2} \\angle A C B=45^{\\circ}, \\angle A E B=180^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}-22.5^{\\circ}=67.5^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle E I A=\\angle B I D=180^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}-22.5^{\\circ}=67.5^{\\circ}$. Hence triangle $I E A$ is isosceles and a reflection of the bisector of $\\angle I A E$ takes $I$ to $E$ and $K$ to itself. So triangle $I K E$ is symmetric with respect to this axis, i.e. $\\angle K I E=\\angle I E K=\\angle B E K=45^{\\circ}$. So $90^{\\circ}$ is a possible value for $\\angle B A C$, too.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\angle B E K=45^{\\circ}$ then $\\angle B E K=\\angle I E K=\\angle I F K=45^{\\circ}$. Then\n\n- either $F=E$, which makes the angle bisector $B I$ be an altitude, i.e., which makes triangle $A B C$ isosceles with base $A C$ and hence equilateral and so $\\angle B A C=60^{\\circ}$,\n- or $E$ lies between $F$ and $C$, which makes the points $K, E, F$ and $I$ concyclic, so $45^{\\circ}=$ $\\angle K F C=\\angle K F E=\\angle K I E=\\angle C B I+\\angle I C B=2 \\cdot \\angle I C B=90^{\\circ}-\\frac{1}{2} \\angle B A C$, and so $\\angle B A C=90^{\\circ}$,\n\n\n\n- or $F$ lies between $E$ and $C$, then again, $K, E, F$ and $I$ are concyclic, so $45^{\\circ}=\\angle K F C=$ $180^{\\circ}-\\angle K F E=\\angle K I E$, which yields the same result $\\angle B A C=90^{\\circ}$. (However, for $\\angle B A C=90^{\\circ} E$ lies, in fact, between $F$ and $C$, see Figure 2.

Putting it around, $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ are disjoint if and only if their projections on at least one coordinate axis are disjoint.\n\nFor brevity we call two boxes or intervals adjacent if their indices differ by 1 modulo $n$, and nonadjacent otherwise.\n\nThe adjacent boxes $B_{k}$ and $B_{k+1}$ do not intersect for each $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Hence $\\left(I_{k}, I_{k+1}\\right)$ or $\\left(J_{k}, J_{k+1}\\right)$ is a pair of disjoint intervals, $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. So there are at least $n$ pairs of disjoint intervals among $\\left(I_{1}, I_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(I_{n-1}, I_{n}\\right),\\left(I_{n}, I_{1}\\right) ;\\left(J_{1}, J_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(J_{n-1}, J_{n}\\right),\\left(J_{n}, J_{1}\\right)$.\n\nNext, every two nonadjacent boxes intersect, hence their projections on both axes intersect, too. Then the claim below shows that at most 3 pairs among $\\left(I_{1}, I_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(I_{n-1}, I_{n}\\right),\\left(I_{n}, I_{1}\\right)$ are disjoint, and the same holds for $\\left(J_{1}, J_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(J_{n-1}, J_{n}\\right),\\left(J_{n}, J_{1}\\right)$. Consequently $n \\leq 3+3=6$, as stated. Thus we are left with the claim and its justification.\n\nClaim. Let $\\Delta_{1}, \\Delta_{2}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$ be intervals on a straight line such that every two nonadjacent intervals intersect. Then $\\Delta_{k}$ and $\\Delta_{k+1}$ are disjoint for at most three values of $k=1, \\ldots, n$.\n\nProof. Denote $\\Delta_{k}=\\left[a_{k}, b_{k}\\right], 1 \\leq k \\leq n$. Let $\\alpha=\\max \\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ be the rightmost among the left endpoints of $\\Delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$, and let $\\beta=\\min \\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right)$ be the leftmost among their right endpoints. Assume that $\\alpha=a_{2}$ without loss of generality.\n\nIf $\\alpha \\leq \\beta$ then $a_{i} \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\beta \\leq b_{i}$ for all $i$. Every $\\Delta_{i}$ contains $\\alpha$, and thus no disjoint pair $\\left(\\Delta_{i}, \\Delta_{i+1}\\right)$ exists.\n\n\n\nIf $\\beta<\\alpha$ then $\\beta=b_{i}$ for some $i$ such that $a_{i}<b_{i}=\\beta<\\alpha=a_{2}<b_{2}$, hence $\\Delta_{2}$ and $\\Delta_{i}$ are disjoint. Now $\\Delta_{2}$ intersects all remaining intervals except possibly $\\Delta_{1}$ and $\\Delta_{3}$, so $\\Delta_{2}$ and $\\Delta_{i}$ can be disjoint only if $i=1$ or $i=3$. Suppose by symmetry that $i=3$; then $\\beta=b_{3}$. Since each of the intervals $\\Delta_{4}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$ intersects $\\Delta_{2}$, we have $a_{i} \\leq \\alpha \\leq b_{i}$ for $i=4, \\ldots, n$. Therefore $\\alpha \\in \\Delta_{4} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n}$, in particular $\\Delta_{4} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\neq \\emptyset$. Similarly, $\\Delta_{5}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}, \\Delta_{1}$ all intersect $\\Delta_{3}$, so that $\\Delta_{5} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\cap \\Delta_{1} \\neq \\emptyset$ as $\\beta \\in \\Delta_{5} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\cap \\Delta_{1}$.

By definition, $B=(u, v)$ satisfies this condition if and only if there is a point $C=(x, y) \\in S$ such that $\\frac{1}{2}|u y-v x|=k$. (This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$. Summing up, a point $B=(u, v) \\in S$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$ if and only if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v)$ divides $2 k$.\n\nTranslation by a vector with integer coordinates does not affect $k$-friendship; if two points are $k$-friends, so are their translates. It follows that two points $A, B \\in S, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, are $k$-friends if and only if the point $(u-s, v-t)$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$; i.e., if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t) \\mid 2 k$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. We claim that a $k$-clique cannot have more than $n^{2}$ elements.\n\nIndeed, all points $(x, y) \\in S$ can be divided into $n^{2}$ classes determined by the remainders that $x$ and $y$ leave in division by $n$. If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$. Hence $n \\mid d$ where $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$. And since $n$ does not divide $2 k$, also $d$ does not divide $2 k$. Thus $A$ and $B$ are not $k$-friends and the set $T$ is not a $k$-clique.\n\nNow let $M(k)$ be the least positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above. We are looking for the minimum $k$ such that $M(k)^{2}>200$.\n\nBy the definition of $M(k), 2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, M(k)-1$, but not by $M(k)$ itself. If $M(k)^{2}>200$ then $M(k) \\geq 15$. Trying to hit $M(k)=15$ we get a contradiction immediately ( $2 k$ would have to be divisible by 3 and 5 , but not by 15 ).\n\nSo let us try $M(k)=16$. Then $2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 15$, hence also by their least common multiple $L$, but not by 16 . And since $L$ is not a multiple of 16 , we infer that $k=L / 2$ is the least $k$ with $M(k)=16$.\n\nFinally, observe that if $M(k) \\geq 17$ then $2 k$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of $1,2, \\ldots, 16$, which is equal to $2 L$.

Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$. Let $\\alpha$ be a set of $\\ell$ consecutive boxes containing a total of $N(\\alpha)$ coins. We call $\\alpha$ an $\\operatorname{arc}$ if $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$. In addition, due to $3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2$, box $\\ell$ has exactly 1 coin $c$, the one received from box $\\ell-1$.\n\nLet player $A$ 's next move $M$ pass $k \\leq 2$ coins to boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and $\\ell$ can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If $k<2$ then after move $M$ boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$. If $k=2$ then $M$ adds a coin to box $\\ell$. Also $M$ does not move coin $c$ from $\\ell$ because $c$ is involved in the previous move of $B$. In summary boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ contain $N(\\alpha)$ coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme $\\ell$ of the arc. Ignore $\\ell$ to obtain a shorter arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$.\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since $N \\leq 2 n-3$, there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from $n \\geq 7$ that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc $\\alpha$. Hence $B$ can make the move described above, which leads to an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ after $A^{\\prime}$ 's response.

In view of $y^{3}+z^{3}=(y+z)\\left((y-z)^{2}+y z\\right)$ the two equations take the form\n\n$$\nk(y-z)^{2}+(k-4) y z=8 \\tag{1}\n$$\n$$\nk(y-z)^{2}+(k-1) y z=1 \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIn (1) we have $(k-4) y z \\leq 8$, which implies $k \\leq 4$. Indeed if $k>4$ then $1 \\leq(k-4) y z \\leq 8$, so that $y \\leq 8$ and $z \\leq 8$. This is impossible as $y+z=503 k \\geq 503$. Note next that $y^{3}+z^{3}$ is even in the first equation. Hence $y+z=503 k$ is even too, meaning that $k$ is even. Thus $k=2$ or $k=4$. Clearly (1) has no integer solutions for $k=4$. If $k=2$ then (1) takes the form $(y+z)^{2}-5 y z=4$. Since $y+z=503 k=503 \\cdot 2$, this leads to $5 y z=503^{2} \\cdot 2^{2}-4$. However $503^{2} \\cdot 2^{2}-4$ is not a multiple of 5 . Therefore (1) has no integer solutions.\n\nEquation (2) implies $0 \\leq(k-1) y z \\leq 1$, so that $k=1$ or $k=2$. Also $0 \\leq k(y-z)^{2} \\leq 1$, hence $k=2$ only if $y=z$. However then $y=z=1$, which is false in view of $y+z \\geq 503$. Therefore $k=1$ and (2) takes the form $(y-z)^{2}=1$, yielding $z-y=|y-z|=1$.

Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.", "We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii).

Then we have the relations\n\n$$\nf(2 n)=2 c, \\quad f(4 n)=4 c, \\quad f(6 n)=2 d\n$$\n\n- If $n$ and $2 n$ have the same color, then $f(3 n)=f(n)+f(2 n)=3 c=3 f(n)$.\n- If $n$ and $3 n$ have the same color, then $4 c=f(4 n)=f(n)+f(3 n)=c+f(3 n)$, so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n- If $2 n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, then $2 d=f(6 n)=f(2 n)+f(4 n)=2 c+4 c=6 c$, so $f(3 n)=d=3 c$.\n- Otherwise $n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, and $2 n$ and $3 n$ both have the opposite color to $n$. Therefore we compute $5 c=f(n)+f(4 n)=f(5 n)=f(2 n)+f(3 n)=2 c+f(3 n)$ so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nConsequently, for $k=2$ we necessarily have $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nNow let $a$ be the smallest integer such that $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.

For all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and every $x$ whose color is black, we have $x+l m$ is black and $f(x+\\operatorname{lm})=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. It is clearly true for $l=0$. If $x+l m$ is black and satisfies $f(x+l m)=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$, then $f(x+(l+1) m)=f(x+l m)+f(m)=f(x)+(l+1) f(m)$ and $f(x+(l+1) m+n)=$ $f(x+l m)+f(m+n)=f(x)+l f(m)+f(m+n) \\neq f(x)+(l+1) f(m)+f(n)=f(x+(l+1) m)+f(n)$, so $x+(l+1) m$ is not the same color of $n$, therefore $x+(l+1) m$ is black. Thjs completes the induction.\n\nIn particular we then must have that $2^{l} n$ is white for every $l$, because otherwise since $2^{l} m$ is black we would have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l} m\\right)+f\\left(2^{l} n\\right)=2^{l}(f(m)+f(n))$, and consequently $f(m+n)=$ $f(m)+f(n)$.\n\nLemma 5. For every $l \\geq 1,2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\n\n\nProof. On the one hand we have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l-1}(2 m+n)+2^{l-1} n\\right)$. On the other hand we have\n\n$\\left.2^{l} f(m+n)=2^{l-1} \\cdot 2 f(m+n) \\neq 2^{l-1}(f(m+n)+f(m)+f(n))=2^{l-1}(f(2 m+n)+f(n))=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n\\right)\\right)+f\\left(2^{l-1} n\\right)$.\n\nTherefore $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ and $2^{l-1} n$ have different color, which means $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\nCombining the two lemmas give $j m+2^{l-1} n$ is black for all $j \\geq 2^{l}$ and every $l \\geq 1$.\n\nNow write $m=2^{l-1} m^{\\prime}$ with $m^{\\prime}$ odd.

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles. Hence each side of the square has precisely two adjacent rectangles, and thus the only way of partitionning the square into five rectangles is to have a single inner rectangle and four outer rectangles each covering of the four corners of the square, as claimed.\n\nLet us now show that a square of size $12 \\times 12$ cannot be dissected in the desired way. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ be the outer rectangles (in clockwise orientation along the\n\n\n\nboundary of the square). If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd. Now, the total area of all five rectangles is\n\n$$\n144=6+10 x+2 y+(12-y) z+(12-z)(12-x)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $(y-x)(z-2)=6$.

Then, we claim that Lexi puts an $A$ in the cell in row $r$, column $c$ if $r, c \\in \\mathcal{J}$ or $r, c \\notin \\mathcal{J}$, and a $B$ otherwise, each row and column contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe illustrate this with a simple example: If $k=6$ and we have that $A A A B A B$ and $B B B A B A$ are both in the dictionary, then Lexi could fill the table as follows:\n\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n\nSuppose we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\in \\mathcal{J}$. Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$. Suppose instead we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\notin \\mathcal{J}$. Then again by construction the string in this row/column contains $A$ s at indices $k$ with $k \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell^{\\prime}$. So each row and column indeed contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThus, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ with $|\\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$, Lexi can definitely fill the grid appropriately.

This is because we need at least \\( k \\) strings to cover the columns and \\( k \\) strings to cover the rows, and these strings must be distinct to avoid overlap.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - If \\( m = 2k \\), we can construct a dictionary \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) with \\( 2k \\) different strings.\n   - We can arrange these \\( 2k \\) strings such that each column and each row contains at least one string from \\(\\mathcal{D}\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Any fewer than \\( 2k \\) strings would not guarantee that each column and each row contains a string from \\(\\mathcal{D}\\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer \\( m \\) such that Lexi can fill her grid in the desired manner is \\(\\boxed{2k}\\)."], "pred": ["2k"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

By condition III, between the two 8's, there can be only one odd integer. But there are 7 positions between the two 8 's and only 6 remaining even numbers to place. Thus, all 6 remaining even numbers are placed between the two 8's. The only way in which this is possible is with the two 6's next to the two 8's, then the two 4's, then the two 2's.

For every \\( k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 9\\} \\), there are exactly two elements \\( s_i \\) and \\( s_j \\) such that \\( s_i = s_j = k \\).\n2.

Between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start constructing the sequence. Let's denote the sequence as \\( (s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{18}) \\).\n\nSince \\( s_3 = 1 \\), we know that there must be another 1 in the sequence. Let's denote the positions of the 1's as \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) with \\( i < j \\). By the second condition, \\( j - i = 1 \\), so \\( j = i + 1 \\). Therefore, the 1's must be at positions 1 and 2. So, we have \\( s_1 = 1 \\) and \\( s_2 = 1 \\).\n\nNext, since \\( s_{18} = 8 \\), there must be another 8 in the sequence. Let's denote the positions of the 8's as \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) with \\( m < n \\). By the second condition, \\( n - m = 8 \\), so \\( n = m + 8 \\). Therefore, the 8's must be at positions 18 and 6. So, we have \\( s_{18} = 8 \\) and \\( s_6 = 8 \\).\n\nNow, we need to place the other numbers. The numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 must be placed such that the conditions are satisfied. Let's start by placing the 2's. Since there are two 2's and they must be separated by 2, the 2's must be at positions 2 and 4. So, we have \\( s_2 = 2 \\) and \\( s_4 = 2 \\).\n\nNext, let's place the 3's. Since there are two 3's and they must be separated by 3, the 3's must be at positions 3 and 6. So, we have \\( s_3 = 1 \\) and \\( s_6 = 8 \\).\n\nNow, let's place the 4's. Since there are two 4's and they must be separated by 4, the 4's must be at positions 4 and 8. So, we have \\( s_4 = 2 \\) and \\( s_8 = 4 \\).\n\nNext, let's place the 5's. Since there are two 5's and they must be separated by 5, the 5's must be at positions 5 and 10. So, we have \\( s_5 = 5 \\) and \\( s_{10} = 5 \\).\n\nNext, let's place the 6's. Since there are two 6's and they must be separated by 6, the 6's must be at positions 6 and 12. So, we have \\( s_6 = 8 \\) and \\( s_{12} = 6 \\).\n\nNext, let's place the 7's. Since there are two 7's and they must be separated by 7, the 7's must be at positions 7 and 14. So, we have \\( s_7 = 7 \\) and \\( s_{14} = 7 \\).\n\nFinally, let's place the 9's.

We then place the leftmost digit in such an arrangement as the leftmost digit of the $n$-digit integer (which must be nonzero) and choose the positions for the remaining non-zero digits among the remaining $n-1$ positions; we call the number of ways of doing this $b$. (For example, for the arrangement 14 , the digit 1 is in the leftmost position and the digit 4 can be in any of the remaining $n-1$ positions.) We fill the rest of the positions with 0s. The number of possible integers in each case will be $a b$, since this method will create all such integers and for each of the $a$ arrangements of the non-zero digits, there will be $b$ ways of arranging the digits after the first one.

Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 . (Intuitively, we do this because the problem seems to involve multiples of 5 and multiples of 8 , and $5 \\times 8=40$.)\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 1 , then $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+21$ or $n=40 k+31$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 6 , then $n=40 k+6$ or $n=40 k+16$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n=40 k+1$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 f(n) & =\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(40 k+1)(40 k+2)(40 k+3)(40 k+4)}{8} \\\\\n& =(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe units digit of $40 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $20 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $40 k+3$ is 3 , and the units digit of $10 k+1$ is 1 , so the units digit of the product is the units digit of $(1)(1)(3)(1)$ or 3.\n\nIn a similar way, we treat the remaining seven cases and summarize all eight cases in a chart:\n\n| $n$ | $3 f(n)$ simplified | Units digit of $3 f(n)$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $40 k+1$ | $(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+11$ | $(40 k+11)(10 k+3)(40 k+13)(20 k+7)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+21$ | $(40 k+21)(20 k+11)(40 k+23)(10 k+6)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+31$ | $(40 k+31)(10 k+8)(40 k+33)(20 k+17)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+6$ | $(20 k+3)(40 k+7)(10 k+2)(40 k+9)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+16$ | $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+26$ | $(20 k+13)(40 k+27)(10 k+7)(40 k+29)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+36$ | $(10 k+9)(40 k+37)(20 k+19)(40 k+39)$ | 3 |\n\n(Note that, for example, when $n=40 k+16$, the simplified version of $3 f(n)$ is $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$, so the units digit of $3 f(n)$ is the units digit of $(4)(7)(9)(9)$ which is the units digit of 2268 , or 8 .)\n\nTherefore, $f(n)$ has units digit 1 whenever $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nThere are 4 such integers $n$ between each pair of consecutive multiples of 40 .\n\nSince $2000=50 \\times 40$, then 2000 is the 50 th multiple of 40 , so there are $50 \\times 4=200$ integers $n$ less than 2000 for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, inclusive, there are two additional integers: $n=40(50)+1=2001$ and $n=40(50)+11=2011$.\n\nIn total, 202 of the integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ have a units digit of 1 ."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Number Theory", "code": ["To determine how many of the 2014 integers \\( f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014) \\) have a units digit of 1, we first need to understand the function \\( f(n) \\).

Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $b<a+c$ and $a<b+c$ follow automatically, so only $c<a+b$ ever needs to be checked.\n\nInstead of directly considering triangles and sets of triangle, we can consider triples $(a, b, c)$ and sets of triples $(a, b, c)$ with the appropriate conditions.\n\nFor each positive integer $k \\geq 3$, we use the notation $S_{k}$ to denote the set of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$.\n\nIn this case, $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$, so $c+c<a+b+c=k$, so $2 c<k$ or $c<\\frac{1}{2} k$.\n\nAlso, if $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b+c=k$, then $k=a+b+c \\leq c+c+c$, so $3 c \\geq k$ or $c \\geq \\frac{1}{3} k$.\n\n\nWe will use two important facts:\n\n(F1) $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ for every positive integer $m \\geq 3$, and\n\n(F2) $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$ for every positive integer $k \\geq 3$\n\nFirst, we prove (F1):\n\n\nWe show that $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ by creating a one-to-one correspondence between the triples in $S_{2 m}$ and the triples $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nNote that $S_{2 m}$ is the set of triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, with $c<a+b$, and with $a+b+c=2 m$.\n\nAlso, $S_{2 m-3}$ is the set of triples $(A, B, C)$ of positive integers with $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, with $C<A+B$, and with $A+B+C=2 m-3$.\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{2 m}$ and a corresponding triple $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$.\n\nWe show that $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$ :\n\n* Since $(a, b, c)$ is in $S_{2 m}$, then $c<\\frac{1}{2}(2 m)=m$. This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$. (In other words, it cannot be the case that $c=a+b-1$.) Therefore, $c-1 \\leq(a-1)+(b-1)-1$; that is, $c-1<(a-1)+(b-1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)=2 m-3$.\n\nTherefore, $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, since it satisfies all of the conditions of $S_{2 m-3}$. Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nTherefore, $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$.\n\nSince $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.\n\n\nNext, we prove (F2):\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{k}$ and a corresponding triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$. We show that the triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$ :\n\n* Since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a, b+1$ and $c+1$ are positive integers.\n\n\n\n* Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $0<a \\leq b+1 \\leq c+1$.\n* Since $c<a+b$, then $c+1<a+(b+1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=k$, then $a+(b+1)+(c+1)=k+2$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$. Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$. This proves that $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$.\n\nSuppose that $n=N$ is the smallest positive integer for which $T(n)>2010$.\n\nThen $N$ must be odd:\n\nIf $N$ was even, then by (F1), $T(N-3)=T(N)>2010$ and so $n=N-3$ would be an integer smaller than $N$ with $T(n)>2010$. This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$. Next, we note that if we can find an odd positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010 \\geq$ $T(n-2)$, then we will have found the desired value of $n$ :\n\nThis is because $n$ and $n-2$ are both odd, and by property (F2), any smaller odd positive integer $k$ will give $T(k) \\leq T(n-2) \\leq 2010$ and any larger odd positive integer $m$ will give $T(m) \\geq T(n)>2010$.\n\nWe show that $N=309$ is the desired value of $N$ by showing that $T(309)>2010$ and $T(307) \\leq 2010$.\n\nCalculation of $T(309)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{309}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{309}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 154$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=309-c$.\n\nFor example, if $c=154$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 154$ and $a+b=155$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(1,154),(2,153), \\ldots,(76,79),(77,78)$, of which there are 77 .\n\nAlso, if $c=153$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 153$ and $a+b=156$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(3,153), \\ldots,(77,79),(78,78)$, of which there are 76 .\n\nIn general, if $c$ is even, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible. Since $c$ is even, then $309-c$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal, but they can differ by 1 . In this case, $a=154-\\frac{1}{2} c$ and $b=155-\\frac{1}{2} c$.\n\nTherefore, if $c$ is even, there are $\\left(154-\\frac{1}{2} c\\right)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible triples.\n\nIn general, if $c$ is odd, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible.\n\nSince $c$ is odd, then $309-c$ is even, so $a$ and $b$ can be equal.

Thus, $T(n)$ is roughly equal to $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the sum of the integers from 1 to $\\frac{1}{4} n$. Therefore, $T(n) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n+1\\right) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n\\right)^{2} \\approx \\frac{1}{48} n^{2}$.\n\nIt makes sense to look for an odd positive integer $n$ with $T(n) \\approx 2010$.\n\nThus, we are looking for a value of $n$ that roughly satisfies $\\frac{1}{48} n^{2} \\approx 2010$ or $n^{2} \\approx 96480$ or $n \\approx 310$.\n\nSince $n$ is odd, then it makes sense to consider $n=309$, as in the solution above."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( T(n) > 2010 \\), we need to understand the constraints and properties of triangles with integer side lengths and a given perimeter \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Triangle Inequality\nFor a triangle with sides \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\), the triangle inequality must hold:\n\\[\na + b > c\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Perimeter Constraint\nThe perimeter of the triangle is given by:\n\\[\na + b + c = n\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Integer Solutions\nWe need to count the number of integer solutions \\((a, b, c)\\) that satisfy both the triangle inequality and the perimeter constraint.\n\n### Step 4: Symmetry and Uniqueness\nSince \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\), we can assume \\( a \\leq \\frac{n}{3} \\).

Therefore, $n$ cannot be savage in this case because the integers from 1 to $n$ cannot be partitioned into 3 sets with equal sums.\n\nCase 3: $n=6 k+2$\n\nHere, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+2$ is\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(6 k+2)(6 k+3)=18 k^{2}+15 k+3$, so the sum of the elements of each of the sets $A, B$ and $C$ should be $6 k^{2}+5 k+1$, so that the sums are equal.\n\nIn this case $C$, contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k$, and so $|C| \\geq 3+6+9+\\cdots 6 k=3(1+2+3+\\cdots+2 k)=3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(2 k)(2 k+1)\\right)=6 k^{2}+3 k$\n\nThe set $A$ contains at most the integers $1,3,5,7, \\ldots, 6 k+1$, but does not contain the odd multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $3,9,15, \\ldots, 6 k-3$. Therefore, $|A| \\leq(1+3+5+\\cdots+6 k+1)-(3+9+\\cdots+6 k-3)$\n\n$=\\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[1+6 k+1]-\\frac{1}{2}(k)[3+6 k-3]$\n\n$=(3 k+1)(3 k+1)-k(3 k)$\n\n$=6 k^{2}+6 k+1$\n\n(To compute the sum of each of these arithmetic sequences, we use the fact that the sum of an arithmetic sequence is equal to half of the number of terms times the sum of the first and last terms.)\n\nThe set $B$ contains at most the integers $2,4,6,8, \\ldots, 6 k+2$, but does not contain the even multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $6,12, \\ldots, 6 k$. Therefore, $|B| \\leq(2+4+6+\\cdots+6 k+2)-(6+12+\\cdots+6 k)$\n\n$=\\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[2+6 k+2]-\\frac{1}{2}(k)[6+6 k]$\n\n$=(3 k+1)(3 k+2)-k(3 k+3)$\n\n$=6 k^{2}+6 k+2$\n\nThus, the set $C$ is $2 k+1$ short of the desired sum, while the set $A$ has a sum that is $k$ too big and the set $B$ has a sum that is $k+1$ too big.\n\nSo in order to correct this, we would like to move elements from $A$ adding to $k$, and elements from $B$ which add to $k+1$ all to set $C$.\n\n\n\nSince we are assuming that $n$ is savage, then this is possible, which means that $k+1$ must be even since every element in $B$ is even, so the sum of any number of elements of $B$ is even.\n\nTherefore, $k$ is odd, and so $k=2 l+1$ for some integer $l$, and so\n\n$n=6(2 l+1)+2=12 l+8$, ie. $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\nHaving examined all cases, we see that if $n$ is an even savage integer, then $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\n\nFrom the proof of (b) above, the only possible even savage integers less than 100 are those satisfying the condition that $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer, ie. $8,20,32,44,56,68,80,92$. We already know that 8 is savage, so we examine the remaining 7 possibilities.\n\nWe make a table of the possibilities, using the notation from the proof of (b):\n\n| $n$ | $k$ | Sum of elements <br> to remove from $A$ | Sum of elements <br> to remove from $B$ | Possible? |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 20 | 3 | 3 | 4 | No - cannot remove a sum of 3 from <br> A. |\n| 32 | 5 | 5 | 6 | Yes - remove 5 from $A, 2$ and 4 <br> from $B$ |\n| 44 | 7 | 7 | 8 | Yes - remove 7 from $A, 8$ from $B$ |\n| 56 | 9 | 9 | 10 | No - cannot remove a sum of 9 from <br> A. |\n| 68 | 11 | 11 | 12 | Yes - remove 11 from $A, 4$ and 8 <br> from $B$ |\n| 80 | 13 | 13 | 14 | Yes - remove 13 from $A, 14$ from $B$ |\n| 92 | 15 | 15 | 16 | No - cannot remove a sum of 15 <br> from $A$ (since could only use $1,5,7$, <br> 11,13 ) |\n\nTherefore, the only even savage integers less than 100 are 8, 32, 44, 68 and 80."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To determine all even savage integers \\( n \\) less than 100, we need to analyze the conditions given for a positive integer \\( n \\) to be \"savage\".

Note that every $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k-1)$ is an $\\operatorname{ESE}(2 k)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of sequences in this case is $A(2 k-1)$.\n\nThus, $A(2 k)=A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1)$.\n\n(iv) $\\operatorname{An} \\operatorname{ESO}(2 k+1)$ is either the one term sequence $2 k+1$, or includes $2 k+1$ and more terms, or does not include $2 k+1$.\n\nThere is 1 sequence of the first kind.\n\nAs in (iii), there are $A(2 k)$ sequences of the second kind and $B(2 k)$ sequences of the third kind.\n\nThus, $B(2 k+1)=1+A(2 k)+B(2 k)$.\n\nCombining these facts, for each positive integer $k$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k+1) & =A(2 k+1)+B(2 k+1) \\\\\n& =A(2 k)+(A(2 k)+B(2 k)+1) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k)+B(2 k))+A(2 k)+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+1 \\\\\n& =e(2 k)+e(2 k-1)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(2 k) & =A(2 k)+B(2 k) \\\\\n& =(A(2 k-1)+B(2 k-1))+B(2 k-1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+(A(2 k-2)+B(2 k-2)+1) \\\\\n& =e(2 k-1)+e(2 k-2)+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, for all positive integers $n \\geq 3$, we have $e(n)=e(n-1)+e(n-2)+1$, as required.\n\n\n\nMethod 2 \n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer with $n \\geq 3$, and consider the $\\operatorname{ES}(n)$.\n\nWe divide the sequences into three sets:\n\n(i) The sequence 1 (there is 1 such sequence)\n\n(ii) The sequences which begin with 1 and have more than 1 term\n\n(iii) The sequences which do not begin with 1\n\nWe show that in case (ii) there are $e(n-1)$ sequences and in case (iii) there are $e(n-2)$ sequences.

Each of the resulting sequences is distinct, includes numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, is increasing, and has odd terms in odd positions and even terms in even positions (since each term has been reduced by 1).

Let's compute the first few terms of the sequence:\n- \\(a_1 = 2\\)\n- \\(a_2 = 5\\)\n- \\(a_3 = a_2 \\cdot a_1 = 5 \\cdot 2 = 10\\)\n- \\(a_4 = a_3 \\cdot a_2 = 10 \\cdot 5 = 50\\)\n- \\(a_5 = a_4 \\cdot a_3 = 50 \\cdot 10 = 500\\)\n- \\(a_6 = a_5 \\cdot a_4 = 500 \\cdot 50 = 25000\\)\n- \\(a_7 = a_6 \\cdot a_5 = 25000 \\cdot 500 = 12500000\\)\n- \\(a_8 = a_7 \\cdot a_6 = 12500000 \\cdot 25000 = 312500000000\\)\n- \\(a_9 = a_8 \\cdot a_7 = 312500000000 \\cdot 12500000 = 3906250000000000000\\)\n- \\(a_{10} = a_9 \\cdot a_8 = 3906250000000000000 \\cdot 312500000000 = 1220703125000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"], "pred": ["1220703125000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

If $a$ and $b$ are both positive, then either one of the triangles includes the edge from $(a-1,1)$ to $(b, 0)$ or one of the triangles includes the edge from $(a, 1)$ to $(b-1,0)$, but not both.

If there is an edge from $(a-1,1)$ to $(b, 0)$, then the number of ways to complete the triangulation is $T(a-1, b)$; if there is an edge from $(a, 1)$ to $(b-1,0)$, then the number of ways to complete the triangulation is $T(a, b-1)$; thus $T(a, b)=T(a-1, b)+T(a, b-1)$.

Let's consider the parity of numbers:\n- Even numbers can be written as the sum of two even palindromes or two odd palindromes.\n- Odd numbers can be written as the sum of an odd palindrome and an even palindrome.\n\n### Step 5: Checking Specific Numbers\nWe will check specific numbers to identify patterns:\n- \\(2014\\): Cannot be written as the sum of two palindromes (it is even and cannot be the sum of two odd palindromes).\n- \\(2015\\): Cannot be written as the sum of two palindromes (it is odd and cannot be the sum of two even palindromes).\n\n### Step 6: Generalizing the Pattern\nFrom the above, we observe that:\n- Even numbers greater than 2014 cannot be written as the sum of two palindromes.\n- Odd numbers greater than 2015 cannot be written as the sum of two palindromes.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nThe smallest number greater than 2013 that cannot be written as the sum of two palindromes is the smallest even number greater than 2014, which is 2014.\n\nThus, the least positive integer greater than 2013 that cannot be written as the sum of two palindromes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2014}\n\\]"], "pred": ["2014"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

To understand why, consider a smaller set $T=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}$. If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 .

So $s_{1}=s_{0}$, and for all $n, s_{n}=s_{n+1}$; in short, the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is just 1 .\n\nIn order for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have a period greater than $1, f$ must be many-to-one, so that some values occur more than once (and some values do not occur at all) in the sum $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(10)$ (or, in the original problem, $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(20)$ ). For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$.

Exactly one number in such a sequence will be a multiple of 5 , but that number could also be a multiple of 2 and hence share a common factor with at least one other number in the sequence. There are several cases to consider, namely whether the sequence starts with an even number or an odd number.\n\nIf the sequence starts with an even number, then the second and fourth numbers are both odd, and at least one of them is not a multiple of 3 and hence is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence because it is neither a multiple of 2 nor 3 and hence is at least 5 away from the nearest integer with a common factor.

Let's consider the sequence \\(a, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4, a+5\\).\n\n- If \\(a\\) is even, then \\(a\\) is not cromulent because it is divisible by 2.\n- If \\(a\\) is odd, then \\(a+1\\) is even, so \\(a+1\\) is not cromulent because it is divisible by 2.\n- If \\(a\\) is divisible by 3, then \\(a\\) is not cromulent because it is divisible by 3.\n- If \\(a\\) is not divisible by 3, then \\(a+2\\) is divisible by 3 (since \\(a+2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\) and \\(a+3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\)).\n\nThus, in the worst case, we can have at most 3 cromulent elements.

Therefore, the minimum number of cromulent elements is 2.\n\n### Maximum Number of Cromulent Elements\nThe maximum number of cromulent elements occurs when each element in the sequence is relatively prime to all other elements. This is possible if the sequence is a sequence of 6 consecutive integers that are all prime or if they are all composed of distinct prime factors that do not share any common factors with each other.\n\nFor example, consider the sequence \\(7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\):\n- 7 is relatively prime to 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n- 8 is not relatively prime to 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n- 9 is not relatively prime to 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.\n- 10 is not relatively prime to 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12.\n- 11 is relatively prime to 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12.\n- 12 is not relatively prime to 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nThus, the maximum number of cromulent elements is 3.

If $n$ is not a multiple of 9 , then $l_{n}=L_{n}$, because as $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, the floor function does not increase. This means that $f$ is actually constant on the half-closed interval $\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right]$. If neither $n$ nor $n+1$ are multiples of 9 , then $l_{n+1}=l_{n}+1$.

There are only 16 strings of four 0's and 1's. In addition, because 16 and 625 are relatively prime, it will be shown below that for each such string $s$, there exists exactly one integer $x_{s}$ in the range $0 \\leq x_{s}<10000$ such that the base- 2 and base- 5 representations of $x_{s}$ end in the digits of $s$ (e.g., $x_{1001}$ is the unique positive integer less than 10000 such that $x$ 's base- 5 representation and base- 2 representation both end in 1001).\n\nHere is a proof of the preceding claim: Let $p(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 5 are the string $s$, and $b(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 2 are the string $s$. Then the system $x \\equiv$ $p(s) \\bmod 625$ and $x \\equiv b(s) \\bmod 16$ can be rewritten as $x=p(s)+625 m$ and $x=b(s)+16 n$ for integers $m$ and $n$. These reduce to the Diophantine equation $16 n-625 m=p(s)-b(s)$, which has solutions $m, n$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$, with at least one of $m, n \\geq 0$. Assuming without loss of generality that $m>0$ yields $x=p(s)+625 m \\geq 0$. To show that there exists an $x_{s}<10000$ and that it is unique, observe that the general form of the solution is $m^{\\prime}=m-16 t, n^{\\prime}=n+625 t$. Thus if $p(s)+625 m>10000$, an appropriate $t$ can be found by writing $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, which yields $p(s)+625 m-10000<10000 t \\leq p(s)+625 m$. Because there are exactly 10000 integers in that interval, exactly one of them is divisible by 10000 , so there is exactly one value of $t$ satisfying $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, and set $x_{s}=625(m-16 t)$.\n\nTherefore there will be 16 integers whose base- 2 and base- 5 representations end in the same four digits, possibly with leading 0 's as in the example.

Given \\( T = 8 \\), the volume of the cube is:\n\\[\n8 - 2 = 6\n\\]\nThe volume of a cube is given by \\( s^3 \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length of the cube. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\ns^3 = 6\n\\]\nThe surface area of a cube is given by \\( 6s^2 \\). So, the surface area of the cube is:\n\\[\n6s^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the surface area of the \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times n \\) rectangular prism. The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by:\n\\[\n2(lw + lh + wh)\n\\]\nFor the \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times n \\) rectangular prism, the surface area is:\n\\[\n2(2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot n + 2 \\cdot n) = 2(4 + 4n) = 8 + 8n\n\\]\nAccording to the problem, the surface area of the cube is one-eighth the surface area of the rectangular prism. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n6s^2 = \\frac{1}{8}(8 + 8n)\n\\]\nSince \\( s^2 = \\frac{6}{s} \\), we substitute \\( s^2 = \\frac{6}{s} \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n6 \\cdot \\frac{6}{s} = \\frac{1}{8}(8 + 8n)\n\\]\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{s} = \\frac{8 + 8n}{8} = 1 + n\n\\]\nSince \\( s^2 = \\frac{6}{s} \\), we can solve for \\( s \\):\n\\[\ns^3 = 6 \\implies s = \\sqrt[3]{6}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( s = \\sqrt[3]{6} \\) into the equation \\( \\frac{36}{s} = 1 + n \\), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{\\sqrt[3]{6}} = 1 + n\n\\]\nSince \\( s = \\sqrt[3]{6} \\), we have \\( s^3 = 6 \\), and thus \\( s = \\sqrt[3]{6} \\). Therefore:\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{\\sqrt[3]{6}} = 1 + n\n\\]\nWe know that \\( \\sqrt[3]{6} = s \\), so:\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{s} = 1 + n\n\\]\nSince \\( s = \\sqrt[3]{6} \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{\\sqrt[3]{6}} = 1 + n\n\\]\nWe can simplify this to:\n\\[\n6 \\cdot 6^{2/3} = 1 + n\n\\]\nSince \\( 6^{2/3} = \\sqrt[3]{36} \\), we have:\n\\[\n6 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{36} = 1 + n\n\\]\nSince \\( \\sqrt[3]{36} \\approx 3.3019 \\), we have:\n\\[\n6 \\cdot 3.3019 \\approx 19.8114\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n19.8114 \\approx 1 + n \\implies n \\approx 18.8114\n\\]\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number:\n\\[\nn = 19\n\\]\nTherefore, the value of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]"], "pred": ["19"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Since we need each switch to be on an odd number of times, and we can only flip 3 switches per minute, we need to ensure that the parity of the number of times each switch is flipped is correct.\n\nBy examining the state transitions, we can see that each switch must be flipped an odd number of times to be on, and the total number of flips must be such that each switch is flipped an odd number of times. Given the constraints, 7 minutes is the minimum number of flips required to achieve the desired state.\n\nThus, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]"], "pred": ["7"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Note that $k \\neq 1(\\bmod 3)$ because when $k=1$, the sequence $5,6,7$ is not a lucky trio, and when $k>1,4 k+2$ would be a multiple of 6 greater than 6 , hence it cannot be a semiprime. Trying $k=2,3,5,6,8,9, \\ldots$ allows one to eliminate sequences of three consecutive integers that are not lucky trios, and if lucky trios are ordered by their least elements, one finds that the first three lucky trios are 33,34,35; 85,86,87; and 93,94,95.

A morphed sequence is one that can be obtained by morphing $T$ a finite number of times.\n\nThis solution is divided into three steps. In the first step, a characterization of the possible final morphed sequences is given. In the second step, a lower bound on the number of steps is given, and in the third step, it is shown that this bound can be achieved.\n\nStep 1. Note the following.\n\n- The sum of the elements of $T$ is $1^{2}+2^{2}+\\cdots+10^{2}=385$, and morphs are sum-preserving. So any morphed sequence has sum 385 and a mean of 38.5.\n- The sequence $T$ has positive integer terms, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence has positive integer terms.\n- The sequence $T$ is strictly increasing, and morphs preserve this property. Thus any morphed sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n\n\nNow if the morphed sequence is an arithmetic progression, it follows from the above three observations that it must have the form\n\n$$\n(38.5-4.5 d, 38.5-3.5 d, \\ldots, 38.5+4.5 d)\n$$\n\nwhere $d$ is an odd positive integer satisfying $38.5-4.5 d>0$. Therefore the only possible values of $d$ are $7,5,3,1$; thus there are at most four possibilities for the morphed sequence, shown in the table below. Denote these four sequences by $A, B, C, D$.\n\n|  | $T$ | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 36 | 49 | 64 | 81 | 100 |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $d=7:$ | $A$ | 7 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 70 |\n| $d=5:$ | $B$ | 16 | 21 | 26 | 31 | 36 | 41 | 46 | 51 | 56 | 61 |\n| $d=3:$ | $C$ | 25 | 28 | 31 | 34 | 37 | 40 | 43 | 46 | 49 | 52 |\n| $d=1:$ | $D$ | 34 | 35 | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 | 40 | 41 | 42 | 43 |\n\nStep 2.

Therefore, the only way to form a noncongruent triangle is by choosing a different set of three vertices.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 16 is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{16}{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\binom{16}{3} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 560\n\\]\nHowever, not all sets of three vertices will form a triangle where none of the vertices lie on the 16-gon. Specifically, if the three vertices are consecutive, the triangle will have one vertex on the 16-gon. We need to exclude these cases.\n\nThe number of sets of three consecutive vertices in a 16-gon is 16 (one set for each starting vertex). Therefore, the number of noncongruent triangles is:\n\\[\n560 - 16 = 544\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed is \\(\\boxed{544}\\)."], "pred": ["544"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

When the top tile is rotated about its center by an acute angle \\( \\theta \\), the overlapping area is given as 8.\n\nFirst, let's consider the geometry of the overlapping region. The overlapping region is a square with side length equal to the distance between the parallel sides of the two squares after rotation. This distance is the side length of the original square, which is 3, minus twice the perpendicular distance from the center of the square to the side of the square, which is the side length of the square divided by 2, i.e., 1.5. This perpendicular distance is the same for both squares.\n\nWhen the top square is rotated by \\( \\theta \\), the distance between the parallel sides of the two squares is \\( 3 - 2 \\cdot 1.5 \\cos \\theta = 3 - 3 \\cos \\theta \\).

The remaining cases are as follows.\n\nCase 1: The line $\\ell$ intersects $\\overline{P Q}$ and $\\overline{P R}$ when $1 \\leq A-1 \\leq 17$ and $A-1 \\leq B$.\n\nCase 2: The line $\\ell$ intersects $\\overline{P Q}$ and $\\overline{Q R}$ when $1 \\leq A-1 \\leq 17$ and $A-1 \\geq B$.\n\nCase 3: The line $\\ell$ intersects $\\overline{P R}$ and $\\overline{Q R}$ when $17 \\leq A-1 \\leq B$.\n\nNow proceed case by case.\n\nCase 1: Let $T$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{P R}$. Then the desired probability is $[M Q R T] /[P Q R]=1-[P M T] /[P Q R]$. Since $\\triangle P M T \\sim \\triangle P X R$ and the areas of similar triangles are proportional to the squares of corresponding sides, $[P M T] /[P X R]=(P M / P X)^{2}$. Since $\\triangle P X R$ and $\\triangle P Q R$ both have height $X R$, their areas are proportional to their bases: $[P X R] /[P Q R]=P X / P Q$. Taking the product, $[P M T] /[P Q R]=(P M / P X)^{2}(P X / P Q)=$ $\\frac{P M^{2}}{P X \\cdot P Q}=\\frac{(A-2)^{2}}{(B-1)(17-1)}$, and the final answer is\n\n$$\n\\frac{[M Q R T]}{[P Q R]}=1-\\frac{[P M T]}{[P Q R]}=1-\\frac{(A-2)^{2}}{16(B-1)}\n$$\n\nCase 2: Let $U$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{Q R}$. A similar analysis to the one in the previous case yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{[M Q U]}{[P Q R]}=\\frac{[M Q U]}{[X Q R]} \\cdot \\frac{[X Q R]}{[P Q R]}=\\left(\\frac{M Q}{X Q}\\right)^{2} \\frac{X Q}{P Q}=\\frac{(18-A)^{2}}{16(17-B)}\n$$\n\nCase 3: Let $T$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{P R}$ and let $U$ be the point of intersection of $\\ell$ and $\\overline{Q R}$ as in the previous cases. Let $S$ be the point on $\\overline{P R}$ such that $\\overline{Q S} \\perp \\overline{P Q}$. Then $\\triangle T U R \\sim \\triangle S Q R$, so the areas of these two triangles are proportional to the squares of the corresponding altitudes $M X$ and $Q X$. Thinking of $\\overleftrightarrow{P R}$ as the common base, $\\triangle S Q R$ and $\\triangle P Q R$ have a common altitude, so the ratio of their areas is $S R / P R$. Since $\\triangle P Q S \\sim$ $\\triangle P X R, P S / P R=P Q / P X$ and so $\\frac{S R}{P R}=1-\\frac{P S}{P R}=1-\\frac{P Q}{P X}=\\frac{Q X}{P X}$. Therefore the desired probability is\n\n$$\n\\frac{[T U R]}{[P Q R]}=\\frac{[T U R]}{[S Q R]} \\cdot \\frac{[S Q R]}{[P Q R]}=\\left(\\frac{M X}{Q X}\\right)^{2} \\frac{Q X}{P X}=\\frac{(B-A+1)^{2}}{(B-17)(B-1)}\n$$\n\nUsing the answers from positions 7 and $9, A=4+1+4=9$ and $B=2+7=9$.
