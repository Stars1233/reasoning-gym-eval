Since Steven has 5 peaches, we can calculate the number of peaches Jill has as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of peaches Jill has} = \\text{Number of peaches Steven has} - 8 = 5 - 8 = -3\n   \\]\n   However, since the number of peaches cannot be negative, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation. Given the problem's context, it's more likely that the statement \"Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill\" should be interpreted as \"Jill has 8 fewer peaches than Steven.\" Therefore, we should have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of peaches Jill has} = \\text{Number of peaches Steven has} - 8 = 5 - 8 = -3\n   \\]\n   But since the number of peaches cannot be negative, we should re-evaluate the problem's context.

Therefore, Jake has 11 fewer peaches than Jill, which can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{-11}\n   \\]"], "pred": ["-11"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
