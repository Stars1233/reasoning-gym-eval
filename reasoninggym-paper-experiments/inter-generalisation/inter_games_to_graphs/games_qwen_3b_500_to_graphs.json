We'll count in-degrees for each course:\n- Course 0: in-degree = 1 (from 2)\n- Course 1: in-degree = 1 (from 6)\n- Course 2: in-degree = 3 (from 1, 5, 0)\n- Course 3: in-degree = 2 (from 4, 2)\n- Course 4: in-degree = 2 (from 3, 6)\n- Course 5: in-degree = 2 (from 4, 1)\n- Course 6: in-degree = 6 (from 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 3, 0)\n\nSince there are courses with in-degree greater than 0 and we can't complete all courses without a cycle, we conclude that it's not possible to complete all courses.\n</think>\n<answer>False</answer>",

We need to backtrack. Pressing B instead of A after 12 will give 12 + 2 = 14. Pressing A will give 14 * 2 = 28. Pressing B will give 28 + 2 = 30, which is too high. Backtracking, pressing B after 14 will give 14 + 2 = 16. Pressing A will give 16 * 2 = 32, which is too high. The correct sequence is pressing B after 6 to get 6 + 2 = 8, then A to get 8 * 2 = 16, then B to get 16 + 2 = 18, then A to get 18 * 2 = 36, which is too high. The correct sequence is pressing B after 2 to get 2 + 2 = 4, then A to get 4 * 2 = 8, then B to get 8 + 2 = 10, then A to get 10 * 2 = 20.\n</think>\n<answer>B \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 A</answer>",
