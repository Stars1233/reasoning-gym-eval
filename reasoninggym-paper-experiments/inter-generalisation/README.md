Directories follow the naming structure `inter_{train}_to_{eval}` where `{train}` is the RG category the model was trained on and `{eval}` is the RG category the model was evaluated on.

`original` refers to the model without any RG training.

All using checkpoint at 500 steps, apart from logic which uses the checkpoint after 400.
