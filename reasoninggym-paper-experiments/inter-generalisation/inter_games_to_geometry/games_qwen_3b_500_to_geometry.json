Vector BC is calculated as C - B = (2-7, 5-7) = (-5, -2). The dot product of AB and BC is 3*(-5) + 7*(-2) = -15 - 14 = -29. The magnitudes of AB and BC are \u221a(3\u00b2+7\u00b2) = \u221a58 and \u221a((-5)\u00b2+(-2)\u00b2) = \u221a29, respectively. The cosine of angle ABC is the dot product divided by the product of the magnitudes: cos(ABC) = -29 / (\u221a58 * \u221a29). Therefore, angle ABC is arccos(-29 / (\u221a58 * \u221a29)) in radians, which we convert to degrees.\n</think>\n<answer>123.672\u00b0</answer>",

Then, find the dot product of AB and BC, which is AB\u00b7BC = (-12)(-4) + (-2)(-11) = 48 + 22 = 70. Next, calculate the magnitudes of AB and BC: ||AB|| = \u221a((-12)^2 + (-2)^2) = \u221a(144 + 4) = \u221a148. ||BC|| = \u221a((-4)^2 + (-11)^2) = \u221a(16 + 121) = \u221a137. The cosine of angle ABC is given by the dot product divided by the product of the magnitudes: cos(ABC) = 70 / (\u221a148 * \u221a137). Finally, find angle ABC using arccos and convert to degrees.\n</think>\n<answer>111.805\u00b0</answer>",

The incenter coordinates are I = (2*0 + sqrt(2)*0 + 2*1) / (2 + sqrt(2) + 2) \u2248 (0.637, 6.5).

Therefore, the measure of the remaining angle is 360.0\u00b0 - 384.0\u00b0 = -24.0\u00b0, but since a polygon's interior angle cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem within the constraints of a convex polygon. The sum of the interior angles must be exactly 360\u00b0, and the angles provided exceed this sum, indicating an error in the premise or a need to consider the convexity constraint. Given the problem's setup, the correct approach is to recognize that the angles provided sum to more than 360\u00b0, which is not possible for a single convex 4-gon. However, if we hypothetically consider the sum of the given angles and subtract from 360\u00b0, we get -24\u00b0, which is not feasible.

Therefore, the remaining angle is 360.0\u00b0 - 396.0\u00b0 = -36.0\u00b0, but since we are dealing with a convex polygon, the correct calculation should be 360\u00b0 - 396\u00b0 + 360\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 - 360\u00b0 + 360\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 - 360\u00b0 = 0\u00b0, which is not possible for a convex polygon.
