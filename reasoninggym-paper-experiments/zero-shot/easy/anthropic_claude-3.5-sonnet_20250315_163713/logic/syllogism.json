Looking at the conclusion: \"No birds are elephants\"\n   - This is just the first statement reversed\n   - When we say \"No A are B\", it's logically equivalent to saying \"No B are A\"\n   - Therefore, \"No elephants are birds\" means the same as \"No birds are elephants\"\n\n4. Since the original statement \"No elephants are birds\" is given as true, its logical equivalent \"No birds are elephants\" must also be true.\n\n<answer>Yes</answer>",
