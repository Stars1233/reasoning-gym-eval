Looking at the purple metal cube specifically:\n- It appears in two tests\n- In both cases it's with other objects\n- One test activates (with brown metal cube)\n- Never tested alone\n\n3. Analyzing the pattern:\n- Purple metal cube needs brown metal cube to work\n- When brown metal cube is paired with blue rubber cylinder, it doesn't work\n- So purple metal cube alone is not sufficient\n\n4.

      "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal sphere, cyan metal cube \u2192 on\ngray metal sphere \u2192 on\ncyan metal cube \u2192 off\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder \u2192 off\nred metal cube \u2192 on\npurple rubber sphere, red rubber cylinder \u2192 off\n\nNew test case:\npurple rubber sphere\n\nWhat is the detector light status?",
