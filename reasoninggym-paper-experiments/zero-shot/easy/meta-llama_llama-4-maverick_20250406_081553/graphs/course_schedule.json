The prerequisites are in the form of (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to 'a' indicates that 'a' requires 'b'. The given prerequisites are: [(1, 5), (3, 5), (6, 1), (4, 5), (0, 4), (3, 6), (6, 5), (2, 5)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty graph as a dictionary where each key represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of courses that it is a prerequisite for. However, for detecting cycles, it's more useful to directly represent the prerequisites. So, we create a dictionary where each key is a course and its value is a list of its prerequisites.\n- Course 0: [4]\n- Course 1: [5]\n- Course 2: [5]\n- Course 3: [5, 6]\n- Course 4: [5]\n- Course 5: []\n- Course 6: [1, 5]\n\nCorrecting the understanding: We actually need to represent it as:\n- Course 0 requires: 4\n- Course 1 requires: 5\n- Course 2 requires: 5\n- Course 3 requires: 5, 6\n- Course 4 requires: 5\n- Course 5 requires: None\n- Course 6 requires: 1, 5\n\nSo, the graph (or adjacency list) representing the prerequisites is:\n{0: [4], 1: [5], 2: [5], 3: [5, 6], 4: [5], 5: [], 6: [1, 5]}\n\n## Step 4: Apply the topological sorting algorithm to detect cycles\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we need to detect if there's a cycle in the graph. We can do this by performing a topological sort. If a topological sort is possible, then there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 5: Perform topological sorting\nFirst, we calculate the in-degree of each node (course).\n- In-degree of 0: 1 (since 0 requires 4, and 4 is required by 0)\n- In-degree of 1: 1 (since 1 requires 5, and 6 requires 1)\n- In-degree of 2: 1\n- In-degree of 3: 2\n- In-degree of 4: 1\n- In-degree of 5: 4 (since 1, 3, 4, 2, 6 require 5 directly or indirectly, but directly it's required by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)\n- In-degree of 6: 1 (since 3 requires 6)\n\nLet's correct the in-degree calculation directly from the given prerequisites:\n- Course 0: 1 (0 requires 4)\n- Course 1: 1 (1 requires 5), and 6 requires 1\n- Course 2: 1 (2 requires 5)\n- Course 3: 2 (3 requires 5 and 6)\n- Course 4: 1 (4 requires 5), and 0 requires 4\n- Course 5: 5 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 require 5 directly)\n- Course 6: 2 (3 requires 6, and 6 requires 1 and 5)\n\nSo, the in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 5, 6: 1}\n\n## Step 6: Initialize a queue with nodes having an in-degree of 0\nNodes with in-degree 0 are those that have no prerequisites. From our calculation, none of the courses have an in-degree of 0 directly, but we can start with the ones that have the lowest in-degree and see if we can reduce the in-degrees of their neighbors.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the topological sort using the queue\nLet's directly analyze the graph for cycles or use Kahn's algorithm properly.\n1. Initialize the in-degree dictionary: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 1}\n2. Queue = [5] because it has an in-degree of 0.\n3. Dequeue 5, reduce in-degree of its neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6).\n- In-degrees become: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0}\n4. Enqueue nodes with in-degree 0: [2, 4, 6]\n5.

Enqueue 1 and 3.\n- All nodes are now in the queue or have been processed.\n\n## Step 8: Check if all nodes have been visited\nSince we can enqueue all nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and reduce their in-degrees to 0, it means we can finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), where 'a' is the course that requires 'b' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the prerequisites as a graph\nTo solve this, we need to represent the given prerequisites as a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from 'b' to 'a' indicates that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are [(1, 5), (3, 5), (6, 1), (4, 5), (0, 4), (3, 6), (6, 5), (2, 5)]. We will construct the graph based on these pairs.\n\n## Step 3: Construct the graph\nTo construct the graph, we iterate through each prerequisite pair (a, b) and add a directed edge from 'b' to 'a'. The graph will be represented as an adjacency list where graph[i] contains all the courses that have 'i' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node\nThe in-degree of a node (course) is the number of prerequisites it has. We need to calculate the in-degree for each course to identify which courses can be taken first (those with an in-degree of 0).\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting\nTopological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. We will use this concept to check if we can finish all courses. If there's a cycle in the graph (i.e., it's not a DAG), we cannot finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Implement Topological Sorting using BFS\n1. Initialize a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, and for each of its neighbors, decrease their in-degree by 1. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n3. Count the number of nodes visited. If it's equal to the total number of courses (7), we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 7: Execute the Topological Sorting\nFirst, let's construct the graph and calculate in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: []}\n- For each (a, b) in prerequisites: graph[b].append(a) and increment in-degree of 'a'.\n- Prerequisites: [(1, 5), (3, 5), (6, 1), (4, 5), (0, 4), (3, 6), (6, 5), (2, 5)]\n- After processing: graph = {5: [1, 3, 4, 6, 2], 1: [6], 6: [3], 4: [0], 0: [], 2: [], 3: []}\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 2}\n\n## Step 8: Perform BFS\n- Queue initially contains nodes with in-degree 0: [5]\n- Visited count = 0\n- Iterate through the queue, updating in-degrees and adding nodes to the queue as their in-degrees become 0.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed BFS Steps\n1. Queue = [5], Visited = 0\n2. Dequeue 5: Visited = 1, Neighbors = [1, 3, 4, 6, 2]. Decrease their in-degrees. Queue = [1, 3, 4, 2] because their in-degrees become 0 or less than before.\n- In-degrees after dequeuing 5: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 1}\n3. Dequeue 1: Visited = 2, Neighbor = [6]. In-degree of 6 becomes 1. Queue = [3, 4, 2]\n4. Dequeue 3: Visited = 3, Neighbor = []. Queue = [4, 2]\n5. Dequeue 4: Visited = 4, Neighbor = [0]. In-degree of 0 becomes 0. Queue = [2, 0]\n6. Dequeue 2: Visited = 5, No neighbors. Queue = [0]\n7. Dequeue 0: Visited = 6, No neighbors. Queue = []\n8. Dequeue 6: Visited = 7, Neighbor = [3]. But 3 is already visited, and its in-degree is already 0 (because it was dequeued).\n\n## Step 10: Check if all courses can be finished\nVisited count = 7, which equals the total number of courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The in-degree of a node is the number of edges pointing to it.\n- Node 0 has in-degree 1 (from 3).\n- Node 1 has in-degree 3 (from 0, 2, 4).\n- Node 2 has in-degree 1 (from 0).\n- Node 3 has in-degree 1 (from 4).\n- Node 4 has in-degree 2 (from 1, 2).\n\nSo, the in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2}.\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sorting using Kahn's Algorithm\nWe start with nodes having an in-degree of 0. Since there are no nodes with in-degree 0, we directly proceed to understand that the presence of a cycle is likely due to the absence of nodes with 0 in-degree.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the graph for cycles\nGiven that there's no node with 0 in-degree, it indicates a cycle in the graph because every node has at least one prerequisite. Let's directly check for cycles or use the fact that if we can't start topological sorting (because there's no node with 0 in-degree), the graph has a cycle.\n\n## Step 7: Determine if it's possible to finish all courses\nSince there's a cycle (as inferred from the in-degrees and the structure of the graph), it's not possible to finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The in-degree of a node is the number of edges pointing to it. We calculate the in-degree for each course.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Topological Sorting algorithm\nWe'll use Topological Sorting to check if there's a cycle. If we can topologically sort the graph, it means there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses. We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0, reduce the in-degree of their neighbors by 1 as we \"visit\" them, and continue this process.\n\n## Step 6: Implement the Topological Sorting\nFirst, let's correctly construct the graph and calculate in-degrees:\n- Graph: For (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 4), (1, 4), (3, 0), (0, 1), (4, 3), (0, 2), (2, 1), the graph is {0: [1, 2], 1: [4, 3, 2], 2: [], 3: [4], 4: [1, 3]} is incorrect because it doesn't correctly represent the prerequisites.

Create a graph and calculate in-degrees.\n2. Use a queue to start with nodes having in-degree 0.\n\nGiven prerequisites: [(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 4), (1, 4), (3, 0), (0, 1), (4, 3), (0, 2), (2, 1)], let's directly check the feasibility.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

However, for detecting cycles, we'll consider the reverse: a course and its prerequisites.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the correct method to detect if all courses can be finished\nTo check if all courses can be finished, we need to detect if there's a cycle in the graph. We'll use the topological sorting method or a cycle detection algorithm. The graph can be represented as follows for cycle detection:\n- Course 2 -> Course 1\n- Course 0 -> Course 5, Course 4\n- Course 3 -> Course 5\n- Course 4 -> Course 6\n- Course 1 -> Course 6\n- Course 2 -> Course 6\n- Course 5 -> Course 1\n\nLet's build the graph correctly for cycle detection:\n- In-degree of each course and the graph:\n- Course 0: in-degree = 0\n- Course 1: in-degree = 2 (from 2, 5)\n- Course 2: in-degree = 0\n- Course 3: in-degree = 0\n- Course 4: in-degree = 0\n- Course 5: in-degree = 2 (from 0, 3)\n- Course 6: in-degree = 3 (from 4, 1, 2)\n\n## Step 6: Perform topological sorting or cycle detection\nUsing Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting:\n1.

The given prerequisites are: [(2, 1), (0, 5), (0, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (5, 1)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nTo create the adjacency list, we iterate over the prerequisites. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of prerequisites for 'a'. The graph will be represented as an adjacency list where graph[i] contains all the courses that are prerequisites for course 'i'. However, for detecting cycles, it's more intuitive to directly use the given pairs to build the graph where the direction is from the prerequisite to the course.\n\n## Step 4: Detect cycles in the graph using Topological Sorting or DFS\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we need to detect if there's a cycle in the graph. If there's a cycle, it means we cannot finish all courses because there's a circular dependency. We can use Topological Sorting or DFS with cycle detection to solve this.\n\n## Step 5: Implement Topological Sorting using Kahn's Algorithm or DFS\nLet's implement Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sorting. First, we calculate the in-degree of each node (course). Then, we start with nodes having an in-degree of 0, add them to a queue, and gradually decrease the in-degree of their neighbors. If we can process all nodes, then there's no cycle.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate in-degrees and build the graph\nLet's build the graph and calculate in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [5, 4], 1: [6], 2: [1, 6], 3: [5], 4: [6], 5: [1], 6: []}\n- In-degrees: {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 3}\n\nCorrecting the understanding of the graph representation:\n- The correct graph based on the given prerequisites should directly reflect the prerequisites. So, for (a, b), 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a', meaning 'b' -> 'a'.\n\n## Step 7: Apply Kahn's Algorithm\n1. Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0.\n2. Process nodes in the queue, decreasing the in-degree of their neighbors.\n3. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n\nLet's correct and simplify the steps for Kahn's Algorithm:\n- The given prerequisites are [(2, 1), (0, 5), (0, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (5, 1)].\n- Building the graph: {0: [4, 5], 1: [6], 2: [1, 6], 3: [5], 4: [6], 5: [1], 6: []} is incorrect based on the initial description. The correct interpretation should be:\n- For each (a, b), add an edge from b to a.\n- So, the graph is: {1: [2, 5], 4: [0], 5: [0, 3], 6: [1, 2, 4]}.\n\n## Step 8: Execute Kahn's Algorithm with the correct graph and in-degrees\nLet's directly calculate the in-degrees and apply Kahn's Algorithm:\n- In-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 3}\n- Graph: The correct adjacency list is {0: [], 1: [2, 5], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [0], 5: [0, 3], 6: [1, 2, 4]}\n\n## Step 9: Perform Kahn's Algorithm\n1. Nodes with in-degree 0: {2, 3} because they have no prerequisites.\n2. Process these nodes, and update in-degrees of their neighbors.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed Kahn's Algorithm Steps\n- Initial in-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 3}\n- Queue: [2, 3]\n- Process 2: Decrease in-degree of 1. {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 2}\n- Process 3: Decrease in-degree of 5. {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 2}\n- Queue: [2, 3, 5]\n- Process 5: Decrease in-degree of 0 and 3 (but 3 is already processed). {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 2}\n- Queue: [2, 3, 5, 0] (since 0's in-degree is now 1, it's not added yet)\n- Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 11: Continue Kahn's Algorithm\n- Process 5: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 2}, Queue = [2, 3, 5]\n- Add 5 to processed, Queue = [2, 3]. Now, Queue = [3, 1 is not added yet because its in-degree is 1].\n- After processing 3, Queue = [5]. After processing 5, in-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 2}, Queue = [5, 0 is not added].\n- After 5 is processed, Queue = [0 is not added directly]. We need to check the in-degrees again.\n- The correct sequence should continue with the available nodes.\n\nThe final step-by-step in-degrees update:\n- Start with {2, 3} in the queue.\n- After processing 2 and 3: {2, 3, 5} in the queue because 5's in-degree becomes 0.\n- Then, process 5: {0: 1, 1: 1, 3: 0, ...}, and 5 is done. Now, {2, 3, 5} are processed.\n- Queue becomes [4] is not directly added, but 1 is not, 0 is not. Let's directly check the cycle.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nTo create the adjacency list, we iterate over the prerequisites:\n- For (2, 1), add 1 to the list of 2's prerequisites.\n- For (0, 5), add 5 to the list of 0's prerequisites.\n- For (0, 4), add 4 to the list of 0's prerequisites.\n- For (3, 5), add 5 to the list of 3's prerequisites.\n- For (4, 6), add 6 to the list of 4's prerequisites.\n- For (1, 6), add 6 to the list of 1's prerequisites.\n- For (2, 6), add 6 to the list of 2's prerequisites.\n- For (5, 1), add 1 to the list of 5's prerequisites.\n\nThis results in the following adjacency list:\n- Course 0: [5, 4]\n- Course 1: [6]\n- Course 2: [1, 6]\n- Course 3: [5]\n- Course 4: [6]\n- Course 5: [1]\n- Course 6: []\n\n## Step 4: Correct the representation to reflect the direction of prerequisites\nThe correct representation should be:\n- Course 0 has prerequisites: 5, 4\n- Course 1 has prerequisites: 6, 5 (since 5 is a prerequisite for 1, and 6 is a prerequisite for 1 indirectly through other courses)\n- Course 2 has prerequisites: 1, 6\n- Course 3 has prerequisites: 5\n- Course 4 has prerequisites: 6\n- Course 5 has prerequisites: 1 (since 1 is a prerequisite for 5 indirectly)\n- Course 6 has no prerequisites listed directly, but it's a prerequisite for others.\n\nLet's correctly represent the graph:\n- The graph should be represented as an adjacency list where each index represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of courses that it is a prerequisite for. However, for detecting cycles, we'll consider the reverse: a course and its prerequisites.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the correct method to detect if all courses can be finished\nTo check if all courses can be finished, we need to detect if there's a cycle in the graph. We'll use the topological sorting method or a cycle detection algorithm. The graph can be represented as follows for cycle detection:\n- Course 2 -> Course 1\n- Course 0 -> Course 5, Course 4\n- Course 3 -> Course 5\n- Course 4 -> Course 6\n- Course 1 -> Course 6\n- Course 2 -> Course 6\n- Course 5 -> Course 1\n\nLet's build the graph correctly for cycle detection:\n- In-degree of each course and the graph:\n- Course 0: in-degree = 0\n- Course 1: in-degree = 2 (from 2, 5)\n- Course 2: in-degree = 0\n- Course 3: in-degree = 0\n- Course 4: in-degree = 0\n- Course 5: in-degree = 2 (from 0, 3)\n- Course 6: in-degree = 3 (from 4, 1, 2)\n\n## Step 6: Perform topological sorting or cycle detection\nUsing Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting:\n1. Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0.\n2. Courses with in-degree 0 are: 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\n## Step 7: Execute Kahn's algorithm\n1. Queue = [0, 2, 3, 4]\n2. Dequeue a course, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors, and enqueue if their in-degree becomes 0.\n\nLet's execute:\n- Dequeue 0: Decrease in-degree of 4 and 5. (4: 0->0 (already 0), 5: 2->1)\n- Dequeue 2: Decrease in-degree of 1 and 6. (1: 2->1, 6: 3->2)\n- Dequeue 3: Decrease in-degree of 5. (5: 1->0)\n- Dequeue 4: Decrease in-degree of 6. (6: 2->1)\n- Now, Queue = [5] because 5's in-degree is 0.\n- Dequeue 5: Decrease in-degree of 1. (1: 1->0)\n- Now, Queue = [1]\n- Dequeue 1: Decrease in-degree of 6. (6: 1->0)\n- Now, Queue = [6]\n- Dequeue 6: No more courses to decrease in-degree for.\n\n## Step 8: Check if all courses have been visited\nWe've visited all courses in the order: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6. This means we can finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a_i, b_i), indicating that course b_i must be taken before course a_i.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the prerequisites as a graph\nTo solve this problem, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node b_i to node a_i indicates that b_i is a prerequisite for a_i. The given prerequisites are [(2, 1), (0, 5), (0, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (5, 1)]. We will construct the graph based on these prerequisites.\n\n## Step 3: Construct the graph\nThe graph can be represented as an adjacency list. For each prerequisite (a_i, b_i), we add a directed edge from b_i to a_i. So, the graph will be constructed by iterating over the given prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Topological Sorting algorithm\nTo check if it's possible to finish all courses, we can use the Topological Sorting algorithm. This algorithm is used to order the nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every edge (u,v), node u comes before v in the ordering. If a graph has a cycle, it's not possible to perform a topological sort, indicating that it's impossible to finish all courses due to the cyclic dependency.\n\n## Step 5: Implement Topological Sorting using Kahn's algorithm\nKahn's algorithm is a popular method for topological sorting. It works by choosing nodes with no incoming edges (in-degree 0) and removing them from the graph, then repeating this process until all nodes are removed or no more nodes with in-degree 0 exist. If at any point there are nodes remaining but none have an in-degree of 0, it means there's a cycle, and it's impossible to finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate in-degrees and construct the graph\nFirst, we calculate the in-degree of each node (course) and construct the adjacency list representation of the graph.\n- Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n- Prerequisites: [(2, 1), (0, 5), (0, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (5, 1)]\n\nLet's calculate in-degrees:\n- In-degree of 0 = 0\n- In-degree of 1 = 1 (from 5)\n- In-degree of 2 = 1 (from 1)\n- In-degree of 3 = 1 (from 5)\n- In-degree of 4 = 1 (from 0)\n- In-degree of 5 = 2 (from 0, 3)\n- In-degree of 6 = 3 (from 4, 1, 2)\n\nAnd the graph:\n- 1 -> 2\n- 5 -> 0\n- 4 -> 0\n- 5 -> 3\n- 6 -> 4\n- 6 -> 1\n- 6 -> 2\n- 1 -> 5\n\nCorrecting the understanding of the graph and in-degrees based on the given prerequisites:\n- The correct graph is:\n- 1 -> 2\n- 5 -> 0\n- 4 -> 0\n- 5 -> 3\n- 6 -> 4\n- 6 -> 1\n- 6 -> 2\n- 1 -> 5\n\nLet's correctly calculate in-degrees and the graph:\n- 0: in-degree = 2 (from 5, 4)\n- 1: in-degree = 2 (from 6, 5)\n- 2: in-degree = 2 (from 1, 6)\n- 3: in-degree = 1 (from 5)\n- 4: in-degree = 1 (from 6)\n- 5: in-degree = 1 (from 1)\n- 6: in-degree = 0\n\nGraph:\n- 5 -> 0\n- 4 -> 0\n- 1 -> 2\n- 1 -> 5\n- 6 -> 4\n- 6 -> 1\n- 6 -> 2\n- 5 -> 3\n\n## Step 7: Perform Kahn's algorithm\n1. Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0. Here, it's course 6.\n2. Dequeue a node, reduce the in-degree of its neighbors by 1, and enqueue any neighbor that now has an in-degree of 0.\n- Start with 6 (in-degree = 0), reduce in-degrees of 4, 1, 2.\n- 4, 1, 2 now have in-degrees 0, 1, 1 respectively. So, 4 is enqueued.\n- Dequeue 4, reduce in-degree of 0. Now, 0 has in-degree 1.\n- Dequeue 1, reduce in-degrees of 2, 5. Now, 2 has in-degree 1, and 5 has in-degree 0. So, 5 is enqueued.\n- Dequeue 5, reduce in-degrees of 0, 3. Now, 0 has in-degree 0, and 3 has in-degree 0. So, both 0 and 3 are enqueued.\n- Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 8: Execute Kahn's algorithm step-by-step\n1. Queue = [6], visited = 0\n- Dequeue 6, neighbors = [4, 1, 2]. In-degrees: 4=0, 1=1, 2=1. Queue = [4], visited = 1\n2. Dequeue 4, neighbors = [0]. In-degrees: 0=1. Queue = [], visited = 1\n3. Dequeue 1 is not possible since it's not in the queue. Now, 5 is not in the queue but has in-degree 1. We continue:\n- Dequeue is not possible, so we look at the current state: Queue = [], and nodes with in-degree 0 are considered visited or are in the queue.\n- We actually start with 6, then 4. So, Queue = [6, 4]. After dequeuing 6 and 4: Queue = [1, 5] is not correct because 1 and 5 are not in-degree 0 after 6 is dequeued. Correct sequence:\n- Queue = [6]\n- After 6: Queue = [4] because 4's in-degree becomes 0.\n- After 4: 0's in-degree = 1, so Queue remains [4]. Then, 1 and 5 are considered. 1 is not in-degree 0, but 5 becomes in-degree 0 after 1 is processed, which is not the case. Correcting the steps:\n- Start: Queue = [6]\n- Dequeue 6: Queue = [4] (because 4's in-degree becomes 0)\n- Dequeue 4: 0's in-degree = 1, Queue = []\n- Since 1 and 5 are interconnected, let's directly analyze the graph for cycles.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze for cycles directly\nLooking closely, there's a cycle: 1 -> 5 -> 1 (or 5 -> 1 -> 5), indicating a cyclic dependency.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

Otherwise, there's a cycle, and we cannot finish all courses.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the steps to the given problem\nLet's apply the above steps to the given prerequisites:\n- Initialize the graph and in-degree dictionary.\n- Populate them: For (1, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (7, 0), (0, 1), (6, 3), (2, 7), (6, 1), (8, 7), (4, 0), (3, 1), we update the graph and in-degree dictionary accordingly.\n\n## Step 9: Execution of Step 5\nGraph = {0: [5, 7, 4], 1: [0, 5, 6, 3], 3: [5, 6], 6: [1], 7: [2, 8], 8: [], 2: [], 4: [], 5: []} is not the correct representation for our needs. Instead, we directly calculate in-degrees: in_degree = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0}. Then update in-degrees based on prerequisites.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate in-degrees\nin_degree = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0}. After updating: in_degree = {0: 3, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 2, 8: 1}.\n\n## Step 11: Perform topological sorting\nQueue initially contains courses with in-degree 0. After checking, we find that there are no courses with in-degree 0 initially because all have prerequisites. Let's directly check for cycles or apply topological sorting.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed Topological Sorting\nLet's directly implement the topological sorting:\n- The given prerequisites are used to calculate the in-degree of each course.\n- Courses with in-degree 0 are added to the queue.\n\n## Step 13: Actual Calculation\nLet's directly calculate:\n- For each (a, b), increment in-degree of 'a'.\n- in_degree = {0: 3, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 2, 8: 1}.\n- Queue = [2, 4, 8] because they have the lowest in-degree (1).\n\n## Step 14: Execute Topological Sorting\nProcessing the queue: [2, 4, 8]. After processing these, we update in-degrees and continue.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), where 'a' is the course that requires 'b' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 2: Create a graph from the given prerequisites\nTo solve this, we first need to create a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from 'b' to 'a' represents that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are [(1, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (7, 0), (0, 1), (6, 3), (2, 7), (6, 1), (8, 7), (4, 0), (3, 1)]. We will represent this as an adjacency list.\n\n## Step 3: Build the adjacency list representation of the graph\nWe iterate through the prerequisites to build the graph. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of prerequisites for 'a'. So, the graph will be represented as {course: [prerequisites]}.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nThe in-degree of a node represents the number of prerequisites it has. We need to count the in-degree for each course to identify which courses have no prerequisites.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting using BFS or DFS\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we'll use Topological Sorting. We start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree = 0) and gradually remove them from the graph, updating the in-degrees of their neighboring nodes. If at any point we cannot remove a node because it has an in-degree greater than 0, and we've visited all nodes that can be visited, it means there's a cycle, and we cannot finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Implement Topological Sorting using BFS\n1. Initialize a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, and for each of its neighbors, decrease their in-degree by 1. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n3. Count the number of nodes visited. If it's equal to the total number of courses (9), we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 7: Execute the Topological Sorting\nLet's build the graph and calculate in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [5, 7, 4], 1: [0, 6, 3], 2: [7], 3: [5, 6], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [1], 7: [2, 8], 8: []} is incorrect based on the given prerequisites. Let's correctly build it:\n- For (1, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (7, 0), (0, 1), (6, 3), (2, 7), (6, 1), (8, 7), (4, 0), (3, 1), the correct graph is:\n- 1: [6], 5: [0, 3], 7: [0], 0: [1], 6: [3, 1], 2: [7], 8: [7], 4: [0], 3: [1].\n- Correcting the understanding: The graph should be represented as {a: [b_i]} where (a, b) is a prerequisite pair. So, the correct representation is:\n- 1: [0, 6, 3], 0: [5, 7, 4], 3: [5, 6], 7: [2, 8].\n\nLet's correctly calculate the in-degrees and build the graph:\n- The correct adjacency list is: {0: [], 1: [0, 3, 6], 2: [], 3: [1, 5, 6], 4: [], 5: [0, 3], 6: [1, 3], 7: [0, 2, 8], 8: []}.\n- And the in-degrees are: {0: 3, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 3, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1}.\n\n## Step 8: Perform BFS\n- Initialize queue with nodes having in-degree 0: [4, 5, 7].\n- Visited count = 0.\n- While queue is not empty:\n- Dequeue a node, visited count++, and decrease in-degree of its neighbors.\n- For 4: decrease in-degree of 0 (0: 2).\n- For 5: decrease in-degree of 0 (0: 1), 3 (3: 2).\n- For 7: decrease in-degree of 2 (2: 0), add 2 to queue.\n- For 2: decrease in-degree of 7 (7: -1, but since it's already visited and removed from the graph, we don't consider it).\n- Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed BFS Execution\n1. Queue = [4, 5, 7], Visited = 0.\n2. Dequeue 4, Visited = 1, decrease in-degree of 0.\n3. Dequeue 5, Visited = 2, decrease in-degree of 0 and 3.\n4. Dequeue 7, Visited = 3, decrease in-degree of 2 and 8 (2: 0, 8: 0), add 2 and 8 to queue.\n5. Queue = [2, 8].\n6. Dequeue 2, Visited = 4.\n7. Dequeue 8, Visited = 5.\n8. Now, Queue = [].\n9. In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 0}.\n10. Continue with nodes that now have in-degree 0: [2, 8] are already processed. Next, we should look at other nodes.\n\nLet's directly analyze the graph and in-degrees:\n- Initial in-degrees: {0: 3, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 3, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1}.\n- Queue initially: [4, 5, 7].\n- After processing [4, 5, 7], we have [2, 8] in the queue because their in-degrees become 0.\n- Visited count after processing [4, 5, 7, 2, 8] is 5.\n\n## Step 10: Check if all courses can be finished\nAfter visiting 5 nodes, we check if there are remaining nodes with in-degree > 0. If yes, it means there's a cycle, and not all courses can be finished.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>False</answer>",

The given prerequisites are: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (4, 1), (3, 4), (1, 0), (0, 2), (3, 1), (0, 4)]. We will create an adjacency list to represent this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty adjacency list for 5 courses: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: []}. Then, we populate it based on the given prerequisites. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a'. So, the adjacency list becomes:\n- For (2, 4), add 4 to 2's list: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [4], 3: [], 4: []}.\n- For (1, 4), add 4 to 1's list: {0: [], 1: [4], 2: [4], 3: [], 4: []}.\n- For (4, 1), add 1 to 4's list: {0: [], 1: [4], 2: [4], 3: [], 4: [1]}.\n- For (3, 4), add 4 to 3's list: {0: [], 1: [4], 2: [4], 3: [4], 4: [1]}.\n- For (1, 0), add 0 to 1's list: {0: [], 1: [4, 0], 2: [4], 3: [4], 4: [1]}.\n- For (0, 2), add 2 to 0's list: {0: [2], 1: [4, 0], 2: [4], 3: [4], 4: [1]}.\n- For (3, 1), add 1 to 3's list: {0: [2], 1: [4, 0], 2: [4], 3: [4, 1], 4: [1]}.\n- For (0, 4), add 4 to 0's list: {0: [2, 4], 1: [4, 0], 2: [4], 3: [4, 1], 4: [1]}.\nSo, the final adjacency list is: {0: [2, 4], 1: [4, 0], 2: [4], 3: [4, 1], 4: [1]}.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nTo detect cycles, we'll use the in-degree of each node. The in-degree is the number of edges pointing to a node. We calculate it by iterating through the prerequisites:\n- Course 0 is pointed to by 1, so its in-degree is 1.\n- Course 1 is pointed to by 4 and 3, so its in-degree is 2.\n- Course 2 is pointed to by 0, so its in-degree is 1.\n- Course 3 is pointed to by none directly in the initial step, but we see it's pointed to by no other course directly, so its in-degree is 0.\n- Course 4 is pointed to by 2, 1, 3, and 0, so its in-degree is 4.\nThus, the in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 4}.\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sorting using Kahn's Algorithm\nWe start with nodes having an in-degree of 0. Initially, only course 3 has an in-degree of 0. We add it to a queue: [3].\n- We dequeue 3, and for its neighbors (4 and 1), we decrease their in-degrees by 1. So, {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 3}.\n- Now, we check for nodes with in-degree 0. None are found except the ones already processed or not yet processed with in-degree 0. We continue: dequeue none, but we see 1 and 2 and 4 are not 0, and 0 is not 0.\n- We continue the process. Let's correctly apply Kahn's algorithm step by step.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Kahn's Algorithm correctly\n1. Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0. Here, it's [3] because 3 has an in-degree of 0.\n2. Dequeue 3, reduce in-degree of its neighbors (4 and 1) by 1. Now, in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 3}.\n3. Enqueue nodes with in-degree 0. None new are added.\n4. Dequeue none, but let's analyze: 1, 2, 4, and 0 are not 0. Let's directly check for cycles by continuing the topological sort.\n\n## Step 7: Continue Topological Sorting\nSince 3 is dequeued, we have visited 1 course. We now have:\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 3}.\n- Queue: [3] is dequeued, so [].\n\nLet's directly analyze the graph for cycles instead of continuing with Kahn's algorithm step-by-step, as the presence of a cycle indicates it's impossible to finish all courses.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the graph for cycles\nLooking at the prerequisites and the graph:\n- There's a cycle between 1 and 4 because 1 requires 4 and 4 requires 1.\nThis indicates a cycle, meaning it's impossible to finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>False</answer>",

Topological sorting involves:\n- Initializing a queue with nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n- Dequeueing a node, reducing the in-degree of its neighbors by 1, and enqueueing any neighbor whose in-degree becomes 0.\n- Repeating this process until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 5: Check for the presence of a cycle\nIf the number of nodes visited (i.e., dequeued) is equal to the total number of nodes (8 courses), then there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses.

For 3, reduce in-degree of 2 (already 0), for 4, none, for 5, reduce in-degree of 7.\n- The correct sequence should continue until all nodes are processed or it's determined that there's a cycle.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed Topological Sorting\nLet's correct and simplify the process:\n- Start with 6 (in-degree 0).\n- After processing 6: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 7: 2}.

Enqueue none directly, but 7's in-degree is reduced when 2 is processed.\n- Continuing: Process 3 (if in queue), 4, 5, 7. After 2 is processed, 7's in-degree becomes 1. After 5 is processed, 7's in-degree doesn't become 0 because it was already reduced by 2. After 7 is processed, 3 and 5 are already processed or not in queue due to higher in-degree initially.\n\n## Step 10: Checking the cycle\nUpon careful examination, we see that there's a cycle: 0->2->7->0 (or 7->3->2->7, or 0->1 is not part of a cycle but 7->0->2->7 is).

So, for (a, b), 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a', thus 'b' should be in the list of 'a'.\n\nLet's correct this and directly apply it:\n- The correct graph representation should be built based on the given pairs.\n\n## Step 7: Correct the graph representation and calculate in-degrees\nLet's directly calculate the in-degrees and build the graph correctly:\n- For each (a, b), increment in-degree of 'a' and add 'a' to the list of 'b's neighbors.\n\n## Step 8: Execute the Topological Sorting\n1. Initialize the graph and in-degrees.\n2. Queue = courses with in-degree 0.\n3. While Queue is not empty, dequeue a course, decrease in-degree of its neighbors, and if a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the Queue.\n4. If the number of courses dequeued equals the total number of courses, return True; otherwise, return False.\n\n## Step 9: Actual Calculation\nLet's directly build the graph and in-degrees:\n- Graph = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [], 8: []}\n- In-degrees = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFor each (a, b):\n- Increment in-degree of 'a'.\n- Add 'a' to the neighbors of 'b'.\n\nGiven pairs: [(3, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (1, 0), (4, 0), (6, 3), (2, 0), (8, 1), (0, 6), (7, 5), (1, 4), (4, 5), (3, 6), (8, 2), (7, 1)]\n\n## Step 10: Perform the actual computation\nLet's compute:\n- In-degrees:\n- 0: 4 (from 5, 6, 1, 2, 4) - incorrect, let's count: (5,0), (6,0), (1,0), (4,0), (2,0) = 5\n- 1: 3 (from 3, 8, 7) - incorrect, let's count: (3,1), (8,1), (7,1) = 3\n- 2: 1 (from 8)\n- 3: 2 (from 6, ?)\n- 4: 2 (from 1, ?)\n- 5: 1 (from 7, 4)\n- 6: 2 (from 0, 3)\n- 7: 0\n- 8: 0\n\nCorrect In-degrees:\n- 0: 5\n- 1: 3\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 2\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 2\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 2\n- 8: 2\n\nGraph:\n- 0: [5, 6, 1, 4, 2]\n- 1: [3, 8, 7]\n- 2: [8]\n- 3: [6]\n- 4: [1]\n- 5: [4, 7]\n- 6: [0, 3]\n- 7: []\n- 8: []\n\n## Step 11: Apply BFS\nQueue = [7, 8] since they have in-degree 0.\n- Dequeue 7, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (none directly, but it has prerequisites, so we look at its prerequisites' neighbors), actually, we decrease in-degree of courses that 7 is a prerequisite for, but since 7 is not a prerequisite for any course directly in our initial understanding, we directly proceed with the actual graph and in-degrees.\n\nLet's simplify:\n- Initial Queue = courses with 0 in-degree.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFrom the given prerequisites, the adjacency list can be constructed as follows:\n- Course 0 has no prerequisites directly listed, but it's a prerequisite for others.\n- Course 1 requires 5 and 0.\n- Course 2 requires 5.\n- Course 3 requires 2 and 1.\n- Course 4 requires 5.\n- Course 5 requires 0.\n\nSo, the graph is:\n- 0: []\n- 1: [5, 0]\n- 2: [5]\n- 3: [2, 1]\n- 4: [5]\n- 5: [0]\n\nCorrecting the representation based on the given pairs:\n- For (5, 0), 5 requires 0.\n- For (3, 2), 3 requires 2.\n- For (2, 5), 2 requires 5.\n- For (1, 5), 1 requires 5.\n- For (3, 1), 3 requires 1.\n- For (1, 0), 1 requires 0.\n- For (4, 5), 4 requires 5.\n\nThus, the correct adjacency list is:\n- 0: []\n- 1: [5, 0]\n- 2: [5]\n- 3: [2, 1]\n- 4: [5]\n- 5: [0]\n\nLet's correctly represent the graph:\n- 0 -> []\n- 5 -> [0]\n- 3 -> [2]\n- 2 -> [5]\n- 1 -> [5]\n- 3 -> [1]\n- 1 -> [0]\n- 4 -> [5]\n\nSo, the graph is:\n- 0: [1, 5]\n- 1: [3]\n- 2: [3]\n- 3: []\n- 4: []\n- 5: [1, 2, 4]\n\n## Step 4: Apply the topological sorting algorithm to check for cycles\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we need to see if there's a cycle in the graph. We can do this by performing a topological sort. If a topological sort is possible, then there are no cycles, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the in-degree of each node and perform topological sorting\nFirst, let's correctly calculate the in-degree of each node based on the given prerequisites:\n- The graph based on prerequisites is: 0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 3, 0 -> 1 -> 3, 0 -> 1, 5 -> 1, 5 -> 2, 5 -> 4.\n- So, the in-degrees are:\n- 0: 0\n- 1: 2 (requires 5 and 0)\n- 2: 1 (requires 5)\n- 3: 2 (requires 2 and 1)\n- 4: 1 (requires 5)\n- 5: 1 (requires 0)\n\nLet's perform topological sorting:\n1. Start with nodes having in-degree 0. Here, it's course 0.\n2. Decrease the in-degree of its neighbors (5) by 1. So, 5's in-degree becomes 0.\n3. Now, nodes with in-degree 0 are 0 and 5. We've already processed 0, so we process 5. Its neighbors are 1, 2, and 4, so their in-degrees decrease by 1.\n4. After processing 5, the in-degrees are: 1 (1), 2 (0), 4 (0).\n5. Now, nodes with in-degree 0 are 2 and 4. Process them. 2's neighbor is 3, so 3's in-degree decreases by 1. 4 has no neighbors.\n6. After processing 2 and 4, the in-degrees are: 1 (1), 3 (1).\n7. Now, node with in-degree 0 is none directly, but we continue: Process 1. Its neighbor is 3, so 3's in-degree decreases by 1.\n8. After processing 1, 3's in-degree becomes 0. So, we can process 3.\n\n## Step 6: Check if all nodes are visited\nWe've processed all nodes (0, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3), which means we've visited all 6 courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a's prerequisites. So, the graph will be represented as an adjacency list where the index represents the course, and its corresponding value is a list of its prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and calculate the in-degree of each node.\nLet's initialize the graph and in-degree array.\n- Graph: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: []}\n- For (4, 3), (1, 4), (3, 0), (2, 3), (4, 0), (0, 2), (2, 0), (1, 2), (3, 1), we update the graph to represent the prerequisites correctly.

The task involves analyzing the prerequisites to check for any circular dependencies that would prevent completing all courses.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the problem as a graph\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node $b$ to node $a$ indicates that course $b$ is a prerequisite for course $a$. The given prerequisites are: [(6, 8), (0, 4), (3, 1), (7, 2), (5, 2), (2, 3), (8, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (7, 8)].\n\n## Step 3: Build the graph and calculate in-degrees\nFirst, we build the graph and calculate the in-degree of each node (course). The graph will be represented as an adjacency list, and we'll count the number of edges pointing to each node.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and in-degrees\nFor each prerequisite $(a, b)$, we add a directed edge from $b$ to $a$ in the graph. So, the graph will be constructed based on the given list.\n\n## Step 5: Construct the graph\nLet's construct the graph:\n- For (6, 8), add edge from 8 to 6.\n- For (0, 4), add edge from 4 to 0.\n- For (3, 1), add edge from 1 to 3.\n- For (7, 2), add edge from 2 to 7.\n- For (5, 2), add edge from 2 to 5.\n- For (2, 3), add edge from 3 to 2.\n- For (8, 1), add edge from 1 to 8.\n- For (4, 1), add edge from 1 to 4.\n- For (6, 1), add edge from 1 to 6.\n- For (7, 8), add edge from 8 to 7.\n\nThe adjacency list representation will be:\n- 0: [4]\n- 1: []\n- 2: [3, 5, 7]\n- 3: [1, 2]\n- 4: [0, 1]\n- 5: []\n- 6: [1, 8]\n- 7: [2, 8]\n- 8: [1, 6, 7]\n\nCorrecting the representation:\n- 1: [3, 4, 6, 8]\n- 2: [5, 7]\n- 3: [2]\n- 4: [0]\n- 5: []\n- 6: [8]\n- 7: [2]\n- 8: [6, 7]\n\nAnd the in-degrees:\n- 0: 1 (from 4)\n- 1: 4 (from 3, 4, 6, 8)\n- 2: 1 (from 3)\n- 3: 1 (from 1)\n- 4: 1 (from 1)\n- 5: 1 (from 2)\n- 6: 2 (from 1, 8)\n- 7: 2 (from 2, 8)\n- 8: 3 (from 6, 7, 1)\n\nLet's correctly calculate the in-degrees based on the given prerequisites:\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 4\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 0\n- 6: 2\n- 7: 1\n- 8: 2\n\n## Step 6: Perform topological sorting\nWe'll use a queue to perform topological sorting. We start by adding all nodes with an in-degree of 0 to the queue. Then, we iteratively remove nodes from the queue, decrease the in-degree of their neighbors, and add neighbors with an in-degree of 0 to the queue.\n\n## Step 7: Initialize the queue with nodes having in-degree 0\nNodes with in-degree 0 are 5.\n\n## Step 8: Process the queue\nStart with node 5. Decrease in-degree of its neighbors (2). Since 2's in-degree becomes 1, it's not added to the queue yet.\n\nQueue: [5]\n\n## Step 9: Continue topological sorting\nAfter processing 5, the queue is empty. Let's correctly initialize and process:\n- Queue = [5] because 5 has an in-degree of 0.\n- Process 5: Decrease in-degree of 2. Now, 2's in-degree = 1.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the in-degrees and proceed:\n- Initially, Queue = [5] because it's the only node with in-degree 0.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed topological sorting process\n1. Queue = [5], in-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 2}.\n2. Dequeue 5, decrease in-degree of 2. Now, 2's in-degree = 1.\n3. Queue = [], wait for nodes to have in-degree 0.\n\nUpon re-examination:\n- The correct initial queue should include all nodes with 0 in-degree, which is just 5.\n- After removing 5, we check its neighbors and update their in-degrees. 2's in-degree decreases to 1.\n\nTo simplify, let's directly assess the feasibility using the correct in-degrees and graph structure.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the process by directly checking for cycles or using Kahn's algorithm properly\nLet's directly apply Kahn's algorithm or check for cycles.\n\nThe final answer is determined by whether we can visit all nodes (i.e., reduce all in-degrees to 0) or detect a cycle.\n\nThe final count of visited nodes should be 9 if we can finish all courses.\n\n<answer>False</answer>",

The given prerequisites are [(6, 8), (0, 4), (3, 1), (7, 2), (5, 2), (2, 3), (8, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (7, 8)].

For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a's prerequisites. So, the graph will be represented as {course: [list of prerequisites]}.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nThe in-degree of a node represents how many prerequisites it has. We calculate this by iterating through the prerequisites. For each (a, b), we increment the in-degree of 'a' by 1.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Topological Sorting algorithm using BFS\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we use Topological Sorting. We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0 (no prerequisites), add them to a queue, and then iteratively remove nodes from the queue, decreasing the in-degree of their neighbors. If we can remove all nodes, it means we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Initialize the graph and in-degrees\nLet's initialize the graph and in-degrees based on the given prerequisites:\n- Graph: {0: [4], 3: [1], 6: [8, 1], 7: [2, 8], 5: [2], 2: [3], 8: [1], 4: [1]}\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0, 8: 2}\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\nWe start with courses having an in-degree of 0, which are 5 and 7.

Dequeue 7, decrease in-degree of 2 and 8. Queue = [], visited = 2. In-degree of 2 becomes 0, and 8 becomes 1.\n4. Since 2 now has an in-degree of 0, add it to the queue. Queue = [2], visited = 2.\n5. Dequeue 2, decrease in-degree of 3. Queue = [], visited = 3. In-degree of 3 becomes 0.\n6. Add 3 to the queue. Queue = [3], visited = 3.\n7. Dequeue 3, decrease in-degree of 1. Queue = [], visited = 4. In-degree of 1 becomes 3.\n8. Add 3 to the queue is done, now 3 is processed. Since 1 still has an in-degree > 0, we continue.\n9. Since 0, 4, 6, 8 have prerequisites, we check their in-degrees. 0 has in-degree 1, 4 has in-degree 1, 6 has in-degree 1, 8 has in-degree 1.\n10. Continue BFS: Add 0, 4, 6, 8 to the queue when their in-degrees become 0.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed BFS Execution\n- Initially, Queue = [5, 7]. Visited = 2.\n- After processing 5 and 7: 2 and 3 become candidates. Queue = [2]. After processing 2: Queue = [3]. After processing 3: Queue = [1] is not added because 1's in-degree is still 3.\n- The actual sequence will be: [5, 7], then [2], then [3]. Then we check the in-degrees again.\n- After processing 5, 7, 2, 3: The in-degrees are {0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0, 8: 1}.\n- Continuing: Process 3 (done), now Queue = []. We need to check if any new nodes can be added. 1's in-degree is still 3, so it's not added.\n- We see that 1, 4, 6, 8, 0 are dependent on others. Let's correctly track the in-degrees and queue:\n- Initial in-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0, 8: 2}.\n- After processing 5 and 7: {0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0, 8: 1}.\n- Then 2: {0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0, 8: 1}.\n- Then 3: {0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0, 8: 1}.\n- No more nodes can be added to the queue because the in-degrees of 1, 4, 6, 8, 0 are not 0.\n\n## Step 10: Check if all courses can be finished\nSince there are 9 courses and we can only process a subset of them (those with in-degree 0 and their subsequent dependencies), we check if the number of visited nodes (courses that can be taken) equals 9.\n\nThe final count of visited nodes is less than 9 because of the cyclic dependency involving courses 1, 4, 6, 8, and potentially others, indicating a cycle.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

Then, we populate it based on the prerequisites. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a'.

The in-degree is the number of edges pointing to a node.\n- Node 0 has in-degree 2 (from 2 and 4).\n- Node 1 has in-degree 1 (from 3).\n- Node 2 has in-degree 1 (from 1).\n- Node 3 has in-degree 3 (from 2, 0, and indirectly through other nodes, but directly from 0 and 2).\n- Node 4 has in-degree 4 (from 2, 3, 1, and 0).\nLet's correct this by directly counting from the given prerequisites:\n- Node 0 is required by 2 and 4, so its in-degree is 2.\n- Node 1 is required by 3, so its in-degree is 1.\n- Node 2 is required by 1, so its in-degree is 1.\n- Node 3 is required by 2 and 0, so its in-degree is 2.\n- Node 4 is required by 2, 3, 1, and 0, so its in-degree is 4.\nSo, the in-degrees are: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 4}.\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sorting\nWe start with nodes having an in-degree of 0. Since there are no nodes with in-degree 0, we directly proceed to understand that the presence of a cycle is indicated by the inability to start the topological sort due to all nodes having a non-zero in-degree or the graph having a cycle.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the graph for cycles\nGiven that there's no node with an in-degree of 0, it indicates a cycle in the graph because every node is dependent on another node. Let's directly check for cycles or use the in-degree to simplify the analysis.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the analysis by directly checking the feasibility of finishing courses\nSince all nodes have prerequisites and there's a complex interdependence, let's directly analyze the given prerequisites for any obvious cycles or contradictions.\n\n## Step 8: Checking for cycles or contradictions in the prerequisites\nUpon closer inspection, we see that there's a cycle: 0->4, 4->0 (directly or indirectly). For example, 0 requires 4 (0: [4, 3]), and 4 requires 0 (4: [0]), indicating a cycle. The presence of such cycles means it's impossible to finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

So, the graph becomes:\n- For (2, 4), add 4 to 2's list: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [4], 3: [], 4: []}\n- For (3, 1), add 1 to 3's list: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [4], 3: [1], 4: []}\n- For (2, 0), add 0 to 2's list: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [4, 0], 3: [1], 4: []}\n- For (1, 2), add 2 to 1's list: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [4, 0], 3: [1], 4: []}\n- For (3, 4), add 4 to 3's list: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [4, 0], 3: [1, 4], 4: []}\n- For (4, 0), add 0 to 4's list: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [4, 0], 3: [1, 4], 4: [0]}\n- For (2, 3), add 3 to 2's list: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [4, 0, 3], 3: [1, 4], 4: [0]}\n- For (0, 4), add 4 to 0's list: {0: [4], 1: [2], 2: [4, 0, 3], 3: [1, 4], 4: [0]}\n- For (1, 4), add 4 to 1's list: {0: [4], 1: [2, 4], 2: [4, 0, 3], 3: [1, 4], 4: [0]}\n- For (0, 3), add 3 to 0's list: {0: [4, 3], 1: [2, 4], 2: [4, 0, 3], 3: [1, 4], 4: [0]}\nThe final graph is: {0: [4, 3], 1: [2, 4], 2: [4, 0, 3], 3: [1, 4], 4: [0]}.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node\nTo detect cycles, we calculate the in-degree of each node. The in-degree is the number of edges pointing to a node.\n- Node 0 has in-degree 2 (from 2 and 4).\n- Node 1 has in-degree 1 (from 3).\n- Node 2 has in-degree 1 (from 1).\n- Node 3 has in-degree 3 (from 2, 0, and indirectly through other nodes, but directly from 0 and 2).\n- Node 4 has in-degree 4 (from 2, 3, 1, and 0).\nLet's correct this by directly counting from the given prerequisites:\n- Node 0 is required by 2 and 4, so its in-degree is 2.\n- Node 1 is required by 3, so its in-degree is 1.\n- Node 2 is required by 1, so its in-degree is 1.\n- Node 3 is required by 2 and 0, so its in-degree is 2.\n- Node 4 is required by 2, 3, 1, and 0, so its in-degree is 4.\nSo, the in-degrees are: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 4}.\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sorting\nWe start with nodes having an in-degree of 0. Since there are no nodes with in-degree 0, we directly proceed to understand that the presence of a cycle is indicated by the inability to start the topological sort due to all nodes having a non-zero in-degree or the graph having a cycle.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the graph for cycles\nGiven that there's no node with an in-degree of 0, it indicates a cycle in the graph because every node is dependent on another node. Let's directly check for cycles or use the in-degree to simplify the analysis.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the analysis by directly checking the feasibility of finishing courses\nSince all nodes have prerequisites and there's a complex interdependence, let's directly analyze the given prerequisites for any obvious cycles or contradictions.\n\n## Step 8: Checking for cycles or contradictions in the prerequisites\nUpon closer inspection, we see that there's a cycle: 0->4, 4->0 (directly or indirectly). For example, 0 requires 4 (0: [4, 3]), and 4 requires 0 (4: [0]), indicating a cycle. The presence of such cycles means it's impossible to finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The prerequisites are represented as pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to 'a' indicates that 'a' requires 'b'. The given prerequisites are: [(2, 4), (3, 1), (2, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (2, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (0, 3)]. We need to construct an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Construct the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty graph as {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: []}. Then, we populate it based on the prerequisites. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a'. So, the graph will be constructed by iterating through the prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Populate the graph\nIterating through [(2, 4), (3, 1), (2, 0), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (2, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (0, 3)], we get:\n- For (2, 4), add 4 to 2's list.\n- For (3, 1), add 1 to 3's list.\n- For (2, 0), add 0 to 2's list.\n- For (1, 2), add 2 to 1's list.\n- For (3, 4), add 4 to 3's list.\n- For (4, 0), add 0 to 4's list.\n- For (2, 3), add 3 to 2's list.\n- For (0, 4), add 4 to 0's list.\n- For (1, 4), add 4 to 1's list.\n- For (0, 3), add 3 to 0's list.\nThe resulting graph is: {0: [4, 3], 1: [2, 4], 2: [4, 0, 3], 3: [1, 4], 4: [0]}.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting to check if all courses can be finished\nTo check if all courses can be finished, we need to perform a topological sort on the graph. If there's a cycle, it means we cannot finish all courses. We start by calculating the in-degree of each node (course).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the in-degree of each node\nThe in-degree of a node 'a' is the number of edges pointing to 'a'. So, we count how many times 'a' appears as the first element in the prerequisites pairs. The in-degrees are calculated as follows:\n- For 0: appears in (2, 0), (4, 0), so in-degree = 2.\n- For 1: appears in (3, 1), so in-degree = 1.\n- For 2: appears in (1, 2), (2, 3), so in-degree = 2.\n- For 3: appears in (2, 3), (0, 3), so in-degree = 2.\n- For 4: appears in (2, 4), (3, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), so in-degree = 4.\nSo, in-degrees are {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 4}.\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\nWe start with nodes having an in-degree of 0. Since there are no nodes with in-degree 0, we directly check for cycles or apply the topological sorting algorithm. Given the in-degrees, we see that there's no course with 0 prerequisites to start with, indicating a potential cycle.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the presence of a cycle\nSince all nodes have a non-zero in-degree, and given the structure of the graph, we need to directly check for the possibility of finishing courses by attempting to reduce in-degrees as we \"take\" courses.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the analysis by directly checking for cycles or using Kahn's algorithm\nUpon closer inspection, we can simplify our analysis. The presence of a cycle can be detected by using Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. If at any point there are no nodes with in-degree 0, it indicates a cycle.\n\n## Step 10: Apply Kahn's Algorithm\n1. Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0.\n2. Since there are no nodes with in-degree 0, the algorithm terminates immediately, indicating a cycle.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), where 'a' is the course that requires 'b' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 2: Create a graph representation of the courses and their prerequisites\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' represents that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are: [(6, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (5, 2), (0, 4), (4, 2), (7, 2), (1, 0), (6, 0), (8, 7), (8, 1), (0, 7)]. We will represent this as an adjacency list.\n\n## Step 3: Build the adjacency list and calculate the in-degree of each node\nFirst, let's build the adjacency list and calculate the in-degree of each node.\n- For each prerequisite (a, b), we add an edge from 'b' to 'a' in the graph.\n- The in-degree of a node 'a' is the number of edges pointing to 'a'.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm or DFS\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we need to detect if there's a cycle in the graph. We can use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. The steps involve:\n- Initialize a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n- For each node in the queue, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors by 1. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n- If we can visit all nodes (i.e., the number of visited nodes equals the total number of nodes), then there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Kahn's algorithm to the given problem\nLet's apply Kahn's algorithm:\n1. Create the graph: G = {0: [3, 6], 1: [3, 8], 2: [4, 5, 7], 3: [], 4: [0, 6], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [0, 8], 8: []}\n2. Calculate in-degrees: in-degree = {0: 3, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 2, 7: 2, 8: 2}\n3. Initialize queue with nodes having in-degree 0. Upon correcting the graph and in-degrees: The correct graph is {0: [3, 6, 1], 1: [3, 8], 2: [5, 4, 7], 3: [], 4: [6, 0], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [0, 8], 8: []} and in-degrees are {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 2, 7: 2, 8: 2}. So, the queue initially contains {2} because it has an in-degree of 0 (after correcting the understanding of the given prerequisites and calculating the in-degrees properly).\n4. Process the queue.\n\n## Step 6: Execute Kahn's algorithm with the correct in-degrees and graph\nLet's correct and simplify the steps for Kahn's algorithm:\n- The graph based on the given prerequisites is: {0: [3, 6], 1: [3, 8], 2: [5, 4, 7], 3: [], 4: [0, 6], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [0, 8], 8: []}.\n- Correct in-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 2}.\n- Queue = [2] because 2 has an in-degree of 0.\n- Processing 2: Decrease in-degree of 4, 5, 7. So, in-degrees become {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 2}. Now, queue = [2, 4, 5, 7].\n- Continue processing the queue.\n\n## Step 7: Detailed execution of Kahn's algorithm\n1. Queue = [2], visited = 0. In-degrees after processing 2: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 2}. Queue = [2, 4, 5, 7].\n2. Process 4: in-degrees = {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0, 8: 2}. Queue = [4, 5, 7, 0].\n3. Process 5: in-degrees = {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0, 8: 2}. Queue = [4, 5, 7, 0].\n4. Process 7: in-degrees = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0, 8: 1}. Queue = [4, 5, 7, 0, 8] is incorrect because 8 is not yet ready, correct queue after 7 is [4, 5, 7, 0].\n5. Process 0: in-degrees = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 1}. Queue = [0, 6].\n6. Process 6: in-degrees = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 1}. Queue = [6, 1, 3].\n7.

The given prerequisites are: [(6, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (5, 2), (0, 4), (4, 2), (7, 2), (1, 0), (6, 0), (8, 7), (8, 1), (0, 7)]. We will represent the graph as an adjacency list.\n\n## Step 3: Build the adjacency list representation of the graph\nWe iterate through the prerequisites to build the graph. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a's prerequisites. So, the graph will be:\n- Course 0 requires [4, 0, 7] (from (3, 0), (1, 0), (6, 0), and (0, 4), (0, 7)), but correctly it should be: Course 0 is required by [3, 1, 6] and requires [4, 7].\n- Correctly constructing the graph:\n- 0 is required by [3, 1, 6] and requires [4, 7]\n- 1 is required by [3, 8] and requires [0]\n- 2 is required by [5, 4, 7] and has no requirements\n- 3 requires [0, 1]\n- 4 is required by [6, 0] and requires [2]\n- 5 requires [2]\n- 6 requires [4, 0]\n- 7 is required by [8, 0] and requires [2]\n- 8 requires [7, 1]\n\nLet's correctly represent the graph as an adjacency list where each index represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of courses that it requires:\n- 0: [4, 7]\n- 1: [0]\n- 2: []\n- 3: [0, 1]\n- 4: [2]\n- 5: [2]\n- 6: [4, 0]\n- 7: [2]\n- 8: [7, 1]\n\nAnd the graph representing which courses require a particular course:\n- in-degree count for each course is needed for topological sorting.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nTo perform topological sorting, we need to know the in-degree of each node. The in-degree of a node is the number of edges pointing to it.\n- Course 0: in-degree = 3 (required by 3, 1, 6)\n- Course 1: in-degree = 2 (required by 3, 8)\n- Course 2: in-degree = 3 (required by 5, 4, 7)\n- Course 3: in-degree = 0\n- Course 4: in-degree = 2 (required by 6, 0)\n- Course 5: in-degree = 0\n- Course 6: in-degree = 0\n- Course 7: in-degree = 2 (required by 0, 8)\n- Course 8: in-degree = 0\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sorting\nWe start with courses that have an in-degree of 0, which are [3, 5, 6, 8]. We will decrease the in-degree of their neighboring nodes as we \"take\" these courses.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Topological Sorting\n1. Initially, queue = [3, 5, 6, 8] because they have in-degree 0.\n2. As we process each course in the queue, we decrease the in-degree of its required courses.\n- For 3: decrease in-degree of 0 and 1.\n- For 5: decrease in-degree of 2.\n- For 6: decrease in-degree of 4 and 0.\n- For 8: decrease in-degree of 7 and 1.\n\nLet's calculate the in-degrees after processing the initial queue:\n- Processing 3: 0's in-degree = 2, 1's in-degree = 1. Queue = [5, 6, 8, ?]\n- Processing 5: 2's in-degree = 2. Queue = [6, 8]\n- Processing 6: 4's in-degree = 1, 0's in-degree = 1. Queue = [8]\n- Processing 8: 7's in-degree = 1, 1's in-degree = 0. Now, 1 is added to the queue.\n\n## Step 7: Continue Topological Sorting\nContinuing from Step 6:\n- Queue = [8, 1]. After processing 1: 0's in-degree = 0. Now, 0 is added to the queue.\n- Queue = [1, 0]. After processing 0: 4's in-degree = 0, 7's in-degree = 0. Now, 4 and 7 are added to the queue.\n- Queue = [0, 4, 7]. After processing 4: 2's in-degree = 1. After processing 7: 2's in-degree = 0. Now, 2 is added to the queue.\n\n## Step 8: Finalize Topological Sorting\n- Queue = [4, 7, 2]. After processing 2: No more courses to process as all its requirements are met.\n- We've processed all courses: 3, 5, 6, 8, 1, 0, 4, 7, 2.\n\n## Step 9: Determine if all courses can be finished\nWe were able to process all 9 courses in a valid order, which means we can finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

We need to construct the graph and also count the in-degree of each node.\n\n## Step 3: Construct the graph and count the in-degree of each node\nLet's construct the graph:\n- Course 4 requires 2, so edge from 2 to 4.\n- Course 5 requires 2, so edge from 2 to 5.\n- Course 0 requires 5, so edge from 5 to 0.\n- Course 5 requires 1, so edge from 1 to 5.\n- Course 2 requires 4, so edge from 4 to 2.\n- Course 3 requires 0, so edge from 0 to 3.\n- Course 3 requires 4, so edge from 4 to 3.\n- Course 3 requires 5, so edge from 5 to 3.\n- Course 1 requires 2, so edge from 2 to 1.\n- Course 4 requires 3, so edge from 3 to 4.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each course\nLet's calculate the in-degree:\n- Course 0: 1 (from 3)\n- Course 1: 1 (from 5)\n- Course 2: 3 (from 4, 5, 1)\n- Course 3: 3 (from 4, 0, 5)\n- Course 4: 2 (from 2, 3)\n- Course 5: 3 (from 2, 0, 3)\n\nCorrecting the in-degree calculation based on the actual prerequisites given:\n- Course 0 has an in-degree of 1 because it is required by course 3.\n- Course 1 has an in-degree of 1 because it is required by course 5.\n- Course 2 has an in-degree of 3 because it is required by courses 4, 5, and 1.\n- Course 3 has an in-degree of 3 because it is required by course 4.\n- Course 4 has an in-degree of 3 because it is required by courses 2 and 3.\n- Course 5 has an in-degree of 3 because it is required by courses 0 and 3.\n\nLet's accurately count the in-degrees based on the given prerequisites:\n- For (4, 2), (5, 2), (0, 5), (5, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (1, 2), (4, 3), the in-degrees are:\n- Course 0: 1 (3->0)\n- Course 1: 1 (5->1)\n- Course 2: 3 (4->2, 5->2, 1->2)\n- Course 3: 0\n- Course 4: 2 (2->4, 3->4)\n- Course 5: 2 (2->5, 3->5)\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we apply topological sorting. We start with courses that have an in-degree of 0.\n\n## Step 6: Initialize the queue with courses having in-degree 0\nCourse 3 has an in-degree of 0, so we start with it.\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\n1. Start with Course 3 (in-degree 0).\n- Decrease in-degree of 0, 4, 5 by 1.\n- In-degrees: 0 (0), 1 (1), 2 (3), 3 (0), 4 (1), 5 (1)\n\n2. Now, courses 0, 4, 5 have in-degrees decreased. Course 0 now has 0, Course 4 has 1, and Course 5 has 1.\n- Course 0 can be taken next (in-degree 0).\n- Decrease in-degree of 3 by 1. Now, 3 has -1 (but we don't count negative), it was already 0.\n- In-degrees: 0 (0), 1 (1), 2 (3), 3 (0), 4 (1), 5 (1)\n\n3. Continue the process:\n- Take Course 0. In-degrees: 0 (0), 1 (1), 2 (3), 3 (0), 4 (1), 5 (1)\n- Take Course 5 (now in-degree 1, but we need to revisit the graph). Actually, we should directly look at the updated in-degrees after step 1.\n- After taking Course 3: In-degrees are 0, 1 (1), 2 (3), 3 (0), 4 (1), 5 (1).\n- Next, we can take Course 0. In-degrees: 0 (0), 1 (1), 2 (3), 3 (0), 4 (1), 5 (1).\n- Then, we look for other courses with in-degree 0.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the graph for cycles or completion\nLet's directly analyze the given prerequisites and in-degrees:\n- The correct initial in-degrees are: Course 0 (1), Course 1 (1), Course 2 (3), Course 3 (0), Course 4 (2), Course 5 (2).\n- We start with Course 3 (in-degree 0).\n- After processing Course 3, the in-degrees become: Course 0 (0), Course 1 (1), Course 2 (3), Course 4 (1), Course 5 (1).\n- We can take Course 0 next. After that, in-degrees: Course 0 (0), Course 1 (1), Course 2 (3), Course 3 (0), Course 4 (1), Course 5 (1).\n- Continuing, we can take Course 5 or Course 4 if their in-degrees become 0.\n\n## Step 9: Checking for the presence of a cycle\nLet's directly check the prerequisites for any cycles:\n- There's a cycle if we can't finish all courses. Notably, (2, 4), (4, 3), (3, 5), (5, 2) forms a cycle (2->4->3->5->2).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

Then, update based on edges: {0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1}.\n\nLet's correct the construction:\n- The correct adjacency list and in-degrees should be calculated directly from the prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Correctly calculate the in-degrees and construct the adjacency list\nLet's directly calculate:\n- For each pair (a, b), 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a', so 'b' will have an edge to 'a' in the graph.\n- The given pairs are: (4, 0), (4, 5), (7, 5), (0, 3), (6, 0), (1, 3), (2, 3), (5, 3), (2, 6), (1, 7).\n- So, the graph is: 0->4, 5->4, 5->7, 3->0, 0->6, 3->1, 3->2, 3->5, 6->2, 7->1.\n- Adjacency list: {0: [4], 3: [0, 1, 2, 5], 5: [4, 7], 6: [2], 7: [1]}.\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1}.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we apply topological sorting. We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n\n## Step 6: Perform Topological Sorting\n1. Start with nodes having in-degree 0. Here, {3} has in-degree 0.\n2. Decrease in-degree of neighboring nodes of {3} (0, 1, 2, 5) by 1. So, in-degrees become: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 2, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 1}.\n3. Now, nodes with in-degree 0 are {0, 2, 5}. Decrease in-degree of their neighbors.\n4. For {0}, neighbor is {4}, so {4}'s in-degree becomes 1. For {2}, neighbor is {6} (but actually, it's the other way around, 6 is a prerequisite for 2), so {6}'s in-degree doesn't change directly because of {2}, but {2}'s in-degree was decreased to 0. For {5}, neighbors are {4, 7}, so their in-degrees become 1 and 0 respectively.\n5. Continue this process until all nodes are visited or it's determined that there's a cycle.\n\n## Step 7: Continue Topological Sorting\nAfter step 6, we have: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0}.\n- Nodes with in-degree 0 are {0, 2, 5, 7}. Visiting them: {0} decreases {4}'s in-degree to 0; {2} doesn't directly decrease anyone's in-degree because it's not a prerequisite; {5} decreases {4} and {7}'s in-degrees, but {7} is already visited or considered; {7} decreases {1}'s in-degree to 0.\n- So, after visiting {0, 2, 5, 7}, in-degrees: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 0}.\n- Now, nodes with in-degree 0 are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}. We've visited {0, 2, 5, 7}. Next, visit {1, 3, 4}.\n- {1} doesn't have neighbors to decrease; {3} is already visited; {4} decreases no one's in-degree directly because it's not a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 8: Finalize Topological Sorting\nWe've visited all nodes that can be visited. The order can be {3, 0, 2, 5, 7, 1, 4, 6} or a similar valid order. The key is to check if all nodes can be visited.\n\n## Step 9: Check if all courses can be finished\nSince we can visit all 8 nodes ({3, 0, 2, 5, 7, 1, 4, 6}), it means we can finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' represents that course 'a' requires course 'b'. The given prerequisites are: [(4, 0), (4, 5), (7, 5), (0, 3), (6, 0), (1, 3), (6, 0), (1, 3), (2, 3), (5, 3), (2, 6), (1, 7)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty graph as a dictionary where each key represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of its prerequisites or neighbors. Then, we populate this graph based on the given prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Populate the graph with the given prerequisites\nFor each prerequisite (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a's prerequisites. So, the graph will be populated as follows:\n- Course 4 requires courses 0 and 5.\n- Course 7 requires course 5.\n- Course 0 requires course 3.\n- Course 6 requires course 0.\n- Course 1 requires courses 3 and 7.\n- Course 2 requires courses 3 and 6.\n- Course 5 requires course 3.\n\n## Step 5: Implement the graph and calculate in-degree for each node\nWe create a graph where each key is a course and its value is a list of courses that require it. We also calculate the in-degree of each course (the number of prerequisites it has).\n- Graph: {0: [4, 6], 5: [4, 7], 3: [0, 1, 2, 5], 7: [1], 6: [2]}\n- In-degree: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0}.

If at any point we can take all courses (i.e., their in-degree becomes 0), we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 8: Initialize the queue with courses having in-degree 0\nFirst, let's correctly calculate the in-degree:\n- For (4, 0), (4, 5), (7, 5), (0, 3), (6, 0), (1, 3), (2, 3), (5, 3), (2, 6), (1, 7), the in-degrees are:\n- 0: 2 (4, 6)\n- 1: 2 (3, 7)\n- 2: 2 (3, 6)\n- 3: 4 (0, 1, 2, 5)\n- 4: 0\n- 5: 2 (4, 7)\n- 6: 1 (2)\n- 7: 1 (1)\n\nSo, the initial courses with in-degree 0 are {4}.\n\n## Step 9: Perform Topological Sorting\nWe start with course 4. As we take course 4, we decrease the in-degree of its neighbors (0, 5) by 1.\n- In-degree becomes: {0: 1, 5: 1}.\n\n## Step 10: Continue Topological Sorting\nWe continue this process. Initially, the queue has {4}. As we process 4, we add 0 and 5 to the queue because their in-degrees become 1 and 1 respectively, but they are not 0. So, we look for other courses with in-degree 0.\n- Courses with in-degree 0 are {4}. After processing 4: {0, 5} are not added because their in-degree is not 0.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed Topological Sorting Steps\n1. Start with {4} (in-degree 0).\n2. Process 4: Decrease in-degree of 0 and 5. {0: 0, 5: 0}. Now, queue = {0, 5}.\n3. Process 0: Decrease in-degree of 6. {6: 0}. Now, queue = {5, 6}.\n4. Process 5: Decrease in-degree of 7. {7: 0}. Now, queue = {6, 7}.\n5. Process 6: Decrease in-degree of 2. {2: 1}. Now, queue = {7}.\n6. Process 7: Decrease in-degree of 1. {1: 1}. Now, queue = {}.\n7. We now have {6, 7} with in-degree 0, so we add them to the queue and continue.\n\nLet's correct and simplify the steps for Topological Sorting:\n- Initial in-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 0, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1}.\n- Queue initially: {4}.\n- After processing 4: {0: 1, 5: 1}, Queue = {0, 5} (since their in-degrees are now considered for the next step).\n- Correct sequence and in-degree updates will determine if all courses can be finished.\n\n## Step 12: Finalize Topological Sorting\nLet's simplify:\n- Start with 4 (Queue = {4}).\n- Process 4, decrease in-degree of 0 and 5. Queue = {0, 5} because they become {1, 1}.\n- Process 0, decrease in-degree of 6. {6: 0}, Queue = {5, 6}.\n- Process 5, decrease in-degree of 7. {7: 0}, Queue = {6, 7}.\n- Process 6, decrease in-degree of 2. {2: 1}, Queue = {7}.\n- Process 7, decrease in-degree of 1. {1: 1}, Queue = {}.\n- Now, Queue = {6, 7}. Process them.\n- After processing 6 and 7, we have {2: 1, 1: 1}. Still not 0.\n- Continue until all are processed or a cycle is detected.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>False</answer>",

We will construct an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Construct the adjacency list\nTo construct the adjacency list, we iterate through each prerequisite. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a's prerequisites. The graph will be represented as an adjacency list where each index represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of its prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and in-degree array\nWe create a graph where each node (course) is associated with its prerequisites.

The graph is represented as an adjacency list, and we have an array to store the in-degree of each node.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Topological Sorting using BFS or DFS\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we apply topological sorting. We start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree = 0) and gradually remove them from the graph, updating the in-degrees of their neighboring nodes. If we can remove all nodes, then it's possible to finish all courses.\n\n## Step 7: Implement Topological Sorting\nFirst, we initialize the graph and in-degree array. The graph is {0: [3], 1: [3, 7], 2: [3, 6], 3: [], 4: [0, 5], 5: [3], 6: [0], 7: [5]} and in-degrees are {0: 2, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 4, 4: 0, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1}. We start with nodes having in-degree 0, which are {1, 2, 4}.\n\n## Step 8: Perform BFS\nWe enqueue nodes with in-degree 0: {1, 2, 4}. As we dequeue a node, we decrease the in-degree of its neighbors. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, it's enqueued. We continue until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 9: Check if all courses can be finished\nAfter performing BFS, if the count of visited nodes (or the number of nodes dequeued) equals the total number of courses (8), then all courses can be finished. Otherwise, there's a cycle, and not all courses can be finished.\n\n## Step 10: Execute the BFS with the given data\nLet's execute the steps with the actual data: The in-degrees are {0: 2, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 4, 4: 0, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1}. Initially, nodes {1, 2, 4} are in the queue. We process them and update in-degrees accordingly.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed BFS Execution\n1. Dequeue {1, 2, 4}. For 1, neighbors are [3, 7], so in-degree of 3 and 7 decreases. For 2, neighbor is [3, 6], so in-degree of 3 and 6 decreases. For 4, neighbors are [0, 5], so in-degree of 0 and 5 decreases.\n2. Update in-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 1, 6: 0, 7: 0}.\n3. Enqueue nodes with in-degree 0: {6, 7}.\n4. Continue BFS: Dequeue {6, 7}. For 6, neighbor is [0], so in-degree of 0 decreases. For 7, neighbor is [5], so in-degree of 5 decreases.\n5. Update in-degrees: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0}.\n6. Enqueue nodes with in-degree 0: {0, 5}.\n7. Dequeue {0, 5}. For 0, neighbor is [3], so in-degree of 3 decreases. For 5, neighbor is [3], so in-degree of 3 decreases.\n8. Update in-degrees: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0}.\n9.

Continue until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Kahn's Algorithm\n- Start with nodes having in-degree 0: {0}.\n- In-degree of 0 is 0, so we start with 0. Its neighbors are [3, 4, 5, 6]. Decrease their in-degrees: {3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 0, 6: 0}.\n- Now, nodes with in-degree 0 are {0, 5, 6}. Process them: For 5, neighbor is 3, so {3: 0}. For 6, no neighbors to update.\n- Nodes with in-degree 0 are now {5, 6, 3}. Process 3: neighbor is none directly to update, but we've already counted it.\n- Continuing: Process 4 (after 1, 2, 8 are processed or added to queue), 7 (after 8 is processed), and 8 (after being added due to 7 or directly if in-degree becomes 0).\n- Correct sequence and in-degree updates:\n1. Start with 0 (in-degree 0), update neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6.\n2. Now, 5 and 6 have in-degree 0. Process them.\n3. After processing 5, 3's in-degree becomes 1 (then 0 after processing its other prerequisite isn't directly relevant), and 3 can be processed.\n4. The correct order and checking for cycles involves tracking the count of visited nodes.\n\n## Step 7: Execute Kahn's Algorithm with the correct in-degrees and graph\n1.

Dequeueing 1, 2, 7, 8 requires checking their prerequisites.\n- 1, 2 depend on 4. 4's in-degree is 2.\n- 7 depends on 8. 8 depends on 4.\n- So, we need to process 4 and 8.\n\n## Step 8: Continue Kahn's Algorithm\n- After processing 0, 5, 6, 3, we have: {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 2, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 1, 8: 2}.\n- We can now process 3. Queue = [3].\n- After 3, we still need to deal with 1, 2, 4, 7, 8.\n- To process 1, 2, we need 4. To process 7, we need 8. To process 8, we need 4.\n- So, the critical path involves 4.\n\n## Step 9: Finalize Kahn's Algorithm\n- We start with 0, then can take 5, 6. After 5, we can take 3.\n- The order could be: 0, 5, 6, 3, then we look at others.\n- For 4: in-degree is 2.

The given prerequisites are: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (7, 8), (1, 4), (5, 0), (3, 5), (8, 4), (6, 0), (2, 4)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nTo create the adjacency list, we iterate through the prerequisites:\n- For (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), we add edges from 0 to 3, 4, 5, 6.\n- For (7, 8), we add an edge from 8 to 7.\n- For (1, 4), (8, 4), (2, 4), we add edges from 4 to 1, 8, 2.\n- For (3, 5), we add an edge from 5 to 3.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and calculate the in-degree of each node\nWe initialize the graph as an adjacency list and calculate the in-degree of each node.\n- The graph will be represented as {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [], 8: []}.\n- After adding edges based on prerequisites: {0: [3, 4, 5, 6], 1: [4], 2: [4], 3: [5], 4: [1, 2, 8], 5: [3], 6: [], 7: [8], 8: [7]}.\n- Correcting the representation to reflect the direction of prerequisites: {0: [3, 4, 5, 6], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [0, 5], 4: [1, 2, 8], 5: [3], 6: [], 7: [], 8: [7, 4]}.

Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0.\n2. For each node in the queue, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors by 1. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n3. Continue until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Kahn's Algorithm\n- Start with nodes having in-degree 0: {0}.\n- In-degree of 0 is 0, so we start with 0. Its neighbors are [3, 4, 5, 6]. Decrease their in-degrees: {3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 0, 6: 0}.\n- Now, nodes with in-degree 0 are {0, 5, 6}. Process them: For 5, neighbor is 3, so {3: 0}. For 6, no neighbors to update.\n- Nodes with in-degree 0 are now {5, 6, 3}. Process 3: neighbor is none directly to update, but we've already counted it.\n- Continuing: Process 4 (after 1, 2, 8 are processed or added to queue), 7 (after 8 is processed), and 8 (after being added due to 7 or directly if in-degree becomes 0).\n- Correct sequence and in-degree updates:\n1. Start with 0 (in-degree 0), update neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6.\n2. Now, 5 and 6 have in-degree 0. Process them.\n3.

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), where 'a' is the course that requires 'b' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' indicates that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (7, 8), (1, 4), (5, 0), (3, 5), (8, 4), (6, 0), (2, 4)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty graph as a dictionary where each key represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors (courses that it is a prerequisite for). Then, we populate this graph based on the given prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Populate the graph with the given prerequisites\nFor each prerequisite (a, b), we add 'a' to the list of courses that 'b' is a prerequisite for.

We can use Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sorting. First, we identify all nodes with an in-degree of 0 (courses with no prerequisites) and add them to a queue.

Start with {0} in the queue. In-degree of 0 is 0.\n2. Dequeue 0, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6). Now, in-degrees are: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 1, 8: 1}. Add 4, 5, 6 to the queue.\n3. Queue = {4, 5, 6}. Dequeue 4, decrease in-degree of 1, 2, 8. In-degrees: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 1, 8: 0}. Add 1, 2, 8 to the queue.\n4.

Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 10: Finalize the Kahn's Algorithm Execution\nAfter dequeuing all nodes: {0, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 8, 3, 7}, we have visited all 9 courses.

So, 1, 0, 6, 4's in-degrees become 0, 0, 0, 0 respectively.\n- For 7, no neighbors to decrease in-degree.\n- Now, the nodes with in-degree 0 are 1, 0, 6, 4 (in addition to 7 which is already processed).\n- Process 1, 0, 6, 4: For 1, decrease in-degree of 7 (already 0); for 0, no neighbors; for 6, decrease in-degree of 2, 3; for 4, decrease in-degree of 3, 0.\n- After processing 1, 0, 6, 4: 7's in-degree is still 0 (already processed), 2 and 3's in-degrees become 0.\n- Now, process 2 and 3: For 2, no neighbors; for 3, no neighbors.\n\n## Step 6: Check if all courses can be finished\nWe've processed all nodes with in-degree 0 and their neighbors. Let's count how many nodes we've processed.\n\n- Initially, in-degree 0: 5, 7 (2 nodes).\n- After processing 5: 1, 0, 6, 4 (4 more nodes), total = 6.\n- After processing 1, 0, 6, 4: 7 (already counted), 2, 3 (2 more nodes), total = 8.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the final answer based on the topological sorting\nSince we've processed all 8 nodes, it means we can finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to 'a' indicates that 'a' requires 'b'. The given prerequisites are: [(3, 4), (7, 1), (1, 5), (0, 5), (6, 5), (4, 5), (0, 4), (2, 6), (6, 3)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty graph as a dictionary where each key represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of courses that it is a prerequisite for. However, for detecting cycles, it's more convenient to represent the graph such that the key is the course and the value is a list of its prerequisites. So, we create a graph where for each pair (a, b), 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a', thus 'a' will have 'b' in its list of prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Populate the graph with the given prerequisites\nWe iterate through the given prerequisites: [(3, 4), (7, 1), (1, 5), (0, 5), (6, 5), (4, 5), (0, 4), (2, 6), (6, 3)]. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of prerequisites for 'a'. The graph will be represented as {course: [prerequisites]}.\n\n## Step 5: Implement a cycle detection algorithm using DFS or Topological Sorting\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we need to detect if there's a cycle in the graph. One way to do this is by using Topological Sorting. If a topological sort is possible, then there are no cycles, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Perform Topological Sorting\nFirst, we build the graph: {0: [5, 4], 1: [5], 2: [6], 3: [4, 6], 4: [5], 5: [], 6: [5, 3], 7: [1]}. However, the correct representation for Topological Sorting should directly reflect the prerequisites, so we adjust our understanding to directly count incoming edges (in-degree) for each node.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate in-degrees and perform Topological Sorting\nLet's correctly represent the graph and calculate in-degrees:\n- Graph: {3: [4], 7: [1], 1: [5], 0: [5, 4], 6: [5, 3], 4: [5], 2: [6]}\n- In-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 4, 6: 2, 7: 0}\n\n## Step 8: Execute Topological Sorting\nWe start with nodes having in-degree 0, which are 2 and 7. We decrease the in-degree of their neighbors and continue this process.\n\n## Step 9: Check for cycles by verifying if all nodes can be visited\nIf at any point we have nodes remaining with in-degree greater than 0 after visiting all possible nodes with in-degree 0 and their subsequent neighbors, it indicates a cycle.\n\n## Step 10: Apply the Topological Sorting algorithm\nStart with nodes 2 and 7 (in-degree 0), then visit their neighbors, decreasing their in-degrees. We continue until we've visited all nodes or we can't visit any more nodes.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed Topological Sorting steps\n1. Start with 2 and 7.\n2. Visit 2: decrease in-degree of 6. (6: 1)\n3. Visit 7: decrease in-degree of 1. (1: 0)\n4. Now, 1 is available: decrease in-degree of 0 and 5 is not directly affected but 0 is. (0: 1, 5: 4)\n5. Continue this process: 1 -> 5 (5: 3), 6 -> 3 (3: 1), 0 (not directly available yet), 3 (available after 6) ->  (none), 4 -> 0 (0: 0), 5 -> 0, 4, 6 (already done), 0 is now available.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the result of Topological Sorting\nAfter visiting 2 and 7, we have: 2, 7, 1, 6, 3, 4, 0, 5. All courses can be taken.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

We start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree = 0), and then gradually remove courses from the graph as we \"take\" them, updating the in-degrees of their neighboring courses.\n\n## Step 6: Initialize the graph and in-degrees\nLet's initialize the graph and calculate in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [2, 6], 1: [4, 5, 7], 2: [3], 3: [2, 7], 4: [0, 7], 5: [2], 6: [2], 7: [1, 2]}\n- Correcting the graph representation based on the given prerequisites: The actual graph should be constructed directly from the given pairs.\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 5, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 3}\n\n## Step 7: Apply Topological Sorting\nFirst, identify nodes with in-degree 0. Initially, none have in-degree 0 based on the initial incorrect assumption. Let's correct this and directly apply the steps for topological sorting.\n\n## Step 8: Correct the graph and in-degree calculation\nLet's directly calculate the in-degrees and construct the graph correctly:\n- For each (a, b) in [(5, 2), (4, 0), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 7), (7, 2), (0, 2), (7, 1), (3, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 3), (6, 2)], increment in-degree of 'a'.\n- The correct in-degrees are calculated as follows:\n- 0: 1 (from 4), 1: 2 (from 7, 1), 2: 5 (from 5, 7, 0, 3, 6), 3: 1 (from 2), 4: 1 (from 1), 5: 1 (from 1), 6: 1 (from 0), 7: 2 (from 4, 3)\n\n## Step 9: Execute Topological Sorting\n- Initialize a queue with courses having in-degree 0.\n- Upon reevaluation: The correct initial in-degrees are {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 5, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 3}. Let's correctly identify courses with 0 in-degree initially.\n\n## Step 10: Actual Calculation\nLet's directly apply the correct steps:\n1. Courses and their in-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 5, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 3}.\n2. The graph is: {5: [2], 4: [0], 1: [4], 3: [2], 4: [7], 7: [2, 1], 0: [2], 0: [6], 2: [3], 6: [2]}. Simplifying, we get the adjacency list and in-degrees.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify and directly check for cycles using the correct method\nTo simplify, let's directly check if there's a cycle by using the in-degrees and performing a BFS traversal.\n\n## Step 12: Final Topological Sorting Check\nUpon calculating, we find that there are no courses with in-degree 0 initially because all have prerequisites. Let's directly analyze the given data:\n- The given list is [(5, 2), (4, 0), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 7), (7, 2), (0, 2), (7, 1), (3, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 3), (6, 2)].\n- Let's analyze the presence of a cycle directly.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

This is essentially a problem of detecting a cycle in a directed graph, where courses are nodes, and prerequisites are directed edges.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites as a graph\nTo solve this, we first need to represent the given prerequisites as a directed graph. The prerequisites given are: [(5, 2), (4, 0), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 7), (7, 2), (0, 2), (7, 1), (3, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 3), (6, 2)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of the graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list\nFor each prerequisite (a, b), 'a' depends on 'b', so 'b' will be in the list of 'a'. The graph will be represented as an adjacency list where graph[i] contains all courses that have 'i' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and in-degree array\nWe initialize an empty graph and an in-degree array for all 8 courses. The in-degree array keeps track of how many prerequisites each course has.\n\n## Step 5: Populate the graph and in-degree array\nFor each (a, b) in prerequisites, we add 'a' to the list of courses that depend on 'b' and increment the in-degree of 'a'. So, graph[b].append(a) and in_degree[a] += 1.\n\n## Step 6: Perform topological sorting using BFS\nWe start by adding all courses with an in-degree of 0 to a queue. Then, we iteratively remove courses from the queue, decrease the in-degree of their neighbors, and add neighbors with an in-degree of 0 to the queue. If we can visit all 8 courses, then there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 7: Implement the BFS\n1. Initialize the graph and in-degree array.\n2. Populate them based on the prerequisites.\n3. Start BFS with courses having in-degree 0.\n4. Count the number of courses visited.\n\n## Step 8: Execute the BFS algorithm with the given prerequisites\nLet's execute the steps with the given data:\n- Initialize graph = {i: [] for i in range(8)} and in_degree = [0] * 8.\n- Populate graph and in_degree based on [(5, 2), (4, 0), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 7), (7, 2), (0, 2), (7, 1), (3, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6), (2, 3), (6, 2)].\n- For (5, 2), graph[2].append(5), in_degree[5] += 1.\n- For (4, 0), graph[0].append(4), in_degree[4] += 1.\n- For (1, 4), graph[4].append(1), in_degree[1] += 1.\n- For (3, 2), graph[2].append(3), in_degree[3] += 1.\n- For (4, 7), graph[7].append(4), in_degree[4] += 1.\n- For (7, 2), graph[2].append(7), in_degree[7] += 1.\n- For (0, 2), graph[2].append(0), in_degree[0] += 1.\n- For (7, 1), graph[1].append(7), in_degree[7] += 1.\n- For (3, 7), graph[7].append(3), in_degree[3] += 1.\n- For (1, 5), graph[5].append(1), in_degree[1] += 1.\n- For (0, 6), graph[6].append(0), in_degree[0] += 1.\n- For (2, 3), graph[3].append(2), in_degree[3] += 1.\n- For (6, 2), graph[2].append(6), in_degree[6] += 1.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate in-degree and graph explicitly\nAfter populating:\n- in_degree = [1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3] because:\n- Course 0 has 1 prerequisite (4),\n- Course 1 has 2 prerequisites (4, 5, 7),\n- Course 2 has 4 prerequisites (5, 3, 7, 0, 6) - actually 5,\n- Course 3 has 2 prerequisites (2, 7),\n- Course 4 has 1 prerequisite (0, 7) - actually 2,\n- Course 5 has 1 prerequisite (1),\n- Course 6 has 1 prerequisite (0),\n- Course 7 has 3 prerequisites (4, 2, 1) - actually 3.\nLet's correct this step by actually calculating:\n- graph = {0: [4, 6], 1: [7], 2: [5, 3, 7, 0, 6], 3: [2], 4: [1], 5: [1], 6: [0], 7: [4, 3]}\n- in_degree = [1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3]\n\n## Step 10: Apply BFS\nQueue initially contains courses with in-degree 0. So, queue = [2] because in_degree[2] = 0 (after correct calculation).\n\n## Step 11: Execute BFS loop\n1. Dequeue 2, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (5, 3, 7, 0, 6). So, in_degree[5, 3, 7, 0, 6] -= 1.\n2. Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n\nLet's simplify the steps and directly analyze the cycle:\nUpon careful examination, we see that there's a cycle: 2 -> 3 -> 7 -> 2 (or other similar cycles like 2 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 2 indirectly, but directly 2, 3, 7 is a clear cycle).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as pairs (a, b), indicating that course 'b' must be taken before course 'a'.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' represents that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are: [(4, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 0), (7, 6), (6, 0), (4, 7), (1, 0), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 5), (5, 0), (2, 6)]. We need to construct an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Construct the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty graph as a dictionary where each key represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of its prerequisites or neighbors. However, for detecting cycles, it's more convenient to store the graph in terms of out-degrees (courses that depend on the current course) or in-degrees (prerequisites of the current course). Here, we'll directly count in-degrees and build the graph.\n\n## Step 4: Count in-degrees and build the graph\nWe iterate over the prerequisites to count the in-degree of each node (course) and build the graph.\n- For each pair (a, b), 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a', so 'a' has 'b' as an in-edge, and 'b' has 'a' as an out-edge.\n- The in-degree of 'a' is incremented by 1 for each (a, b).\n\n## Step 5: Perform topological sorting\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we perform a topological sort. If there's a cycle (i.e., we cannot finish all courses because of a circular dependency), the sort will fail.\n1. Initialize a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n2. For each node in the queue, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors (out-edges) by 1. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n3. Continue until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 6: Check if all courses can be finished\nIf the number of nodes visited (i.e., the number of courses that can be taken) equals the total number of courses (8), then it's possible to finish all courses. Otherwise, there's a cycle, and it's not possible.\n\n## Step 7: Implement the steps in code\nLet's implement these steps:\n- Initialize the graph and in-degrees.\n- Populate the graph and count in-degrees based on the given prerequisites.\n- Perform topological sorting and count the visited nodes.\n\n## Step 8: Execution\nLet's execute the plan with the given prerequisites:\nPrerequisites = [(4, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 0), (7, 6), (6, 0), (4, 7), (1, 0), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 5), (5, 0), (2, 6)].\nFirst, we build the graph and count in-degrees:\n- Graph and in-degrees initialization.\n- For (4, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 0), (7, 6), (6, 0), (4, 7), (1, 0), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 5), (5, 0), (2, 6), we update in-degrees and the graph.\n\n## Step 9: Actual calculation\nLet's calculate:\n- In-degrees: {0: 4, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 4, 7: 2}\n- Graph: {0: [2, 3, 1, 5, 6], 1: [], 2: [4], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [7], 6: [1, 7, 2], 7: [4]}\nCorrecting the understanding of the graph representation:\n- We actually need to correctly represent the graph as {node: [its neighbors]} and count in-degrees.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the calculation by directly applying topological sorting\nLet's directly apply the topological sorting:\n1. Initialize in-degrees and the graph correctly.\n2. Queue = nodes with in-degree 0.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed Topological Sorting\nGiven prerequisites = [(4, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 0), (7, 6), (6, 0), (4, 7), (1, 0), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 5), (5, 0), (2, 6)],\n- The graph is: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [4], 3: [], 4: [6], 5: [], 6: [1, 7, 2], 7: [4]}\n- And in-degrees are: {0: 4, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 3, 7: 1}\n\nLet's correct and simplify:\n- In-degrees: {0: 4, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 3, 7: 2}\n- Correct graph representation for topological sorting should directly consider the prerequisites.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

First, we calculate the in-degree of each node (course):\n- In-degree of 0 = 2 (since 3 and 1 are prerequisites for 0, but directly it's because of edges from 3 and 1 to 0, so we count the edges to 0)\n- In-degree of 1 = 2 (because of edges from 2 and 3 to 1, but directly from the given data, 3 and 0 are prerequisites for 1 and 3 respectively, so we directly count: 0->1, 3->1)\n- In-degree of 2 = 1 (because 1->2)\n- In-degree of 3 = 2 (because 0->3, and there's no direct edge to 3 from another course other than 1 and 4, so: 1->3, 4->3)\n- In-degree of 4 = 2 (because 2->4, 3->4)\n\nLet's correct the in-degree calculation based on the actual graph:\n- 1 is a prerequisite for 3 and 0, so in-degree of 1 = 1 (from 2).\n- 2 is a prerequisite for 1, so in-degree of 2 = 1 (from 4).\n- 3 is a prerequisite for 0, so in-degree of 3 = 2 (from 1 and 4).\n- 4 is a prerequisite for 2 and 3, so in-degree of 4 = 0.\n- 0 has in-degree = 2 (from 1 and 3).\n- Correcting the above with actual counts from the given prerequisites and constructed graph:\n- In-degree of 0 = 2\n- In-degree of 1 = 1 (0->1, 3->1)\n- In-degree of 2 = 1 (1->2)\n- In-degree of 3 = 1 (1->3)\n- In-degree of 4 = 2 (2->4, 3->4)\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sorting\nLet's correctly calculate the in-degrees and perform Topological Sorting:\n- The correct in-degrees based on the graph are:\n- In-degree of 0 = 2\n- In-degree of 1 = 2 (since 3 and 0 are prerequisites for 1, directly: 3->1, 0->1)\n- In-degree of 2 = 1\n- In-degree of 3 = 2\n- In-degree of 4 = 2\n\nStarting with nodes having in-degree 0:\n- None have in-degree 0 initially because all have some prerequisites.\n\nLet's directly apply the topological sort algorithm with the correct understanding:\n1. Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0.\n2. For each node in the queue, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors by 1, and add them to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0.\n\n## Step 6: Execute Topological Sorting\nFirst, let's correctly identify nodes with in-degree 0:\n- Upon reviewing, we see that actually, we need to directly count the in-degrees from the given prerequisites:\n- 0: 2 (from 3 and 1)\n- 1: 2 (from 2 and 3, considering the edges)\n- 2: 1 (from 4, considering the edge 4->2)\n- 3: 2 (from 1 and 4)\n- 4: 0\n\nSo, we start with course 4 (in-degree = 0).\n\n## Step 7: Topological Sorting Steps\n1. Start with 4 (in-degree = 0).\n- Decrease in-degree of 2 and 3 by 1.\n- In-degree of 2 = 0, In-degree of 3 = 0.\n\n2. Now, queue = [4, 2, 3].\n- For 2, decrease in-degree of 1 by 1.\n- For 3, decrease in-degree of 0 and 1 by 1.\n\nLet's continue the process with the correct in-degrees and queue:\n- Initially, queue = [4].\n- After processing 4: queue = [2, 3] because in-degree of 2 and 3 becomes 0.\n- After processing 2: queue = [3, 1] because in-degree of 1 becomes 0 (from 1).\n- After processing 3: queue = [1, 0] because in-degree of 0 becomes 0 (from 2).\n- After processing 1: queue = [0].\n\n## Step 8: Check if all courses can be finished\nWe've processed all 5 courses (4, 2, 3, 1, 0), so it's possible to finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' represents that course 'a' requires course 'b'. The given prerequisites are: [(5, 6), (0, 5), (7, 1), (5, 2), (3, 0), (1, 9), (7, 6), (8, 2), (2, 0), (4, 0), (9, 2), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 7), (4, 5), (7, 4)].\n\n## Step 3: Build the graph and calculate the in-degree of each node\nFirst, we build the graph and calculate the in-degree of each node.\n- The graph will be represented as an adjacency list.\n- For each prerequisite (a, b), we add an edge from 'b' to 'a' in the graph.\n- The in-degree of a node 'a' is the number of edges pointing to 'a'.\n\n## Step 4: Implement the topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm or DFS\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we can use topological sorting. If there's a cycle in the graph (i.e., it's not a DAG), we cannot finish all courses. We'll use Kahn's algorithm for this.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Kahn's algorithm\n1. Initialize a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors by 1, and enqueue any neighbor whose in-degree becomes 0.\n3. If the number of nodes dequeued equals the total number of courses (10), then it's possible to finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Execute Kahn's algorithm with the given data\nLet's build the graph and apply Kahn's algorithm:\n- Courses: 0 to 9\n- Prerequisites: [(5, 6), (0, 5), (7, 1), (5, 2), (3, 0), (1, 9), (7, 6), (8, 2), (2, 0), (4, 0), (9, 2), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 7), (4, 5), (7, 4)]\n\n## Step 7: Calculate in-degrees and build the graph\nIn-degrees: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] initially.\nGraph: {}\nAfter processing prerequisites:\n- Graph: {6: [5, 7], 5: [0, 4], 1: [7], 2: [5, 8, 9], 0: [3, 2, 4, 5, 6], 9: [1], 7: [6, 4], 8: [], 3: [], 4: []}\n- Correcting the graph representation based on the given prerequisites:\n{0: [3, 2, 4, 5, 6], 5: [0], 7: [1], 2: [5, 8], 3: [], 1: [7], 9: [], 6: [5, 7], 8: [], 4: [7]}\nAnd in-degrees:\n- 0: 5, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 3, 8: 1, 9: 1\n\n## Step 8: Initialize the queue with nodes having in-degree 0\nNodes with in-degree 0 are: 3, 8, 9.\n\n## Step 9: Perform Kahn's algorithm\nQueue = [3, 8, 9].\n1.

Since 1 has in-degree 0, it's added to the queue. Queue = [1].\nAfter 1 is processed: Queue = [7] because 7's in-degree is not 0 yet.\n6.

The graph is represented as an adjacency list, and the in-degree is the number of edges pointing to a node.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and in-degrees\nLet's initialize the graph and in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [], 8: [], 9: []}\n- In-degrees: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0}\n\n## Step 5: Populate the graph and update in-degrees based on the prerequisites\nFor each prerequisite (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a' in the graph and increment the in-degree of 'a'.\n- Prerequisites: [(5, 6), (0, 5), (7, 1), (5, 2), (3, 0), (1, 9), (7, 6), (8, 2), (2, 0), (4, 0), (9, 2), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 7), (4, 5), (7, 4)]\n- After processing: Graph = {0: [5, 2, 6], 1: [7], 2: [5, 8, 9], 3: [0], 4: [0, 5, 7], 5: [0, 4], 6: [7, 5], 7: [6, 4], 8: [], 9: [1]}, In-degrees = {0: 3, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 0, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 3, 7: 3, 8: 1, 9: 1}\n\n## Step 6: Apply Topological Sorting\nWe start with nodes having an in-degree of 0, which are the courses that can be taken without any prerequisites. We then decrease the in-degree of their neighbors and repeat the process until we have visited all nodes or we cannot proceed further.\n\n## Step 7: Identify initial nodes with in-degree 0\nFrom Step 5, the in-degrees are: {0: 3, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 0, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 3, 7: 3, 8: 1, 9: 1}. The nodes with in-degree 0 are {3}.\n\n## Step 8: Perform Topological Sorting\nStarting with {3}, we visit each node, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors, and add them to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0.\n\n## Step 9: Execute the Topological Sorting algorithm\n1. Start with node 3 (in-degree 0). Decrease in-degree of 0. Now, in-degrees = {0: 2, ...}.\n2. Queue = [3], Visited = [3]. In-degrees after visiting 3: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 0, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 3, 7: 3, 8: 1, 9: 1}.\n3. Next, visit nodes with in-degree 0. Now, {8, 9, 1} have in-degrees 1 or less after re-checking: {1: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}. So, we can visit 8, 9, 1.\n4. After visiting 8, 9, 1, we update in-degrees and continue. We will check for other nodes with in-degree 0 and continue the process.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed Topological Sorting\nLet's simplify:\n- Initially, Queue = [3] because 3 is the only node with in-degree 0.\n- After visiting 3, we have 0 with in-degree 2. So, Queue = [3], and we decrease in-degree of 0 to 2.\n- We continue this process. After visiting 3, we check for other nodes: 8, 9, 1 have in-degrees 1. So, they can be visited next.\n- Visiting 8, 9, 1: Decrease in-degrees of their neighbors. After visiting 1, 7's in-degree decreases. After visiting 9, 1's neighbors (none directly, but 1 is already visited), and 8, 2's in-degree decreases.\n- We continue until we cannot add more nodes to the queue or we've visited all 10 nodes.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for cycles by verifying if all nodes can be visited\nIf at the end, we've visited all 10 nodes, it means there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses. Otherwise, there's a cycle, and we cannot finish all courses.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the Topological Sorting process\nLet's directly analyze the given prerequisites for any obvious cycles or issues.\n\n## Step 13: Analyze the graph for cycles\nUpon closer inspection, there's a cycle: 4 -> 5 -> 0 -> 4 (through other nodes) and directly: 4 -> 7 -> 6 -> 7 (or 4 -> 5 -> 0 and other paths). Notably, 0 -> 5, 5 -> 0 is not directly present but 0, 5, 6, 7, 4 are interconnected.

The graph is represented as an adjacency list, and in-degrees are stored in a separate list. For each prerequisite (a, b), we add an edge from 'b' to 'a' in the graph and increment the in-degree of 'a'.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and in-degrees\nLet's initialize the graph and in-degrees based on the given prerequisites.\n- Graph: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [], 8: [], 9: []}\n- In-degrees: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n## Step 5: Populate the graph and in-degrees\nPopulating the graph:\n- (5, 6): 6 -> 5, so graph[6].append(5), in-degree[5] += 1\n- (0, 5): 5 -> 0, so graph[5].append(0), in-degree[0] += 1\n- (7, 1): 1 -> 7, so graph[1].append(7), in-degree[7] += 1\n- (5, 2): 2 -> 5, so graph[2].append(5), in-degree[5] += 1\n- (3, 0): 0 -> 3, so graph[0].append(3), in-degree[3] += 1\n- (1, 9): 9 -> 1, so graph[9].append(1), in-degree[1] += 1\n- (7, 6): 6 -> 7, so graph[6].append(7), in-degree[7] += 1\n- (8, 2): 2 -> 8, so graph[2].append(8), in-degree[8] += 1\n- (2, 0): 0 -> 2, so graph[0].append(2), in-degree[2] += 1\n- (4, 0): 0 -> 4, so graph[0].append(4), in-degree[4] += 1\n- (9, 2): 2 -> 9, so graph[2].append(9), in-degree[9] += 1\n- (5, 0): 0 -> 5, so graph[0].append(5), in-degree[5] += 1\n- (6, 0): 0 -> 6, so graph[0].append(6), in-degree[6] += 1\n- (6, 7): 7 -> 6, so graph[7].append(6), in-degree[6] += 1\n- (4, 5): 5 -> 4, so graph[5].append(4), in-degree[4] += 1\n- (7, 4): 4 -> 7, so graph[4].append(7), in-degree[7] += 1\n\nAfter populating:\n- Graph: {0: [3, 2, 5, 6, 4], 1: [7], 2: [5, 8, 9], 3: [], 4: [7], 5: [0, 4], 6: [5, 7], 7: [6], 8: [], 9: [1]}\n- In-degrees: [4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\n## Step 6: Perform topological sorting\nTo check if all courses can be finished, we perform a topological sort.

Let's correct this step by actually calculating the in-degrees properly and then finding nodes with in-degree 0.\n\n## Step 8: Correct the in-degrees calculation\nLet's correctly calculate the in-degrees:\n- in-degree[0] = 4 (from 5, 2, 4, 6)\n- in-degree[1] = 1 (from 7)\n- in-degree[2] = 3 (from 5, 8, 9)\n- in-degree[3] = 1 (from 0)\n- in-degree[4] = 2 (from 7, 0)\n- in-degree[5] = 3 (from 0, 2, 6)\n- in-degree[6] = 2 (from 7, 5)\n- in-degree[7] = 3 (from 1, 6, 4)\n- in-degree[8] = 1 (from 2)\n- in-degree[9] = 1 (from 1)\n\nCorrect in-degrees: [4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1]\n\n## Step 9: Identify nodes with in-degree 0\nUpon correcting, we see that there are no nodes with in-degree 0 initially because all nodes have some prerequisites.

If the number of nodes visited equals the total number of courses (10), then it's possible to finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate in-degrees and construct the adjacency list\n- Initialize in-degrees for all courses to 0.\n- For each prerequisite $(a, b)$, increment the in-degree of $a$ and add $b$ to $a$'s adjacency list.\n\n## Step 7: Execute Topological Sorting\nLet's calculate:\n- In-degrees: Course 0 has in-degree 1, Course 1 has in-degree 0, Course 2 has in-degree 1, Course 3 has in-degree 2, Course 4 has in-degree 2, Course 5 has in-degree 2, Course 6 has in-degree 5, Course 7 has in-degree 0, Course 8 has in-degree 3, Course 9 has in-degree 0.\n- Adjacency list: {0: [2, 4], 1: [3, 5], 2: [6, 5], 3: [6, 8], 4: [3], 5: [6], 6: [], 7: [8], 8: [6], 9: [8, 4]}.\n- Correcting the above step with actual calculations:\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 3, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 5, 7: 0, 8: 3, 9: 0}.\n- Queue initially: [1, 7, 9].\n\n## Step 8: Perform Topological Sorting\n1. Start with nodes in the queue: [1, 7, 9].\n2. Visit each node, reduce in-degree of its neighbors, and add them to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0.\n- Visit 1: Reduce in-degree of 3 and 5. In-degrees: {3: 2, 5: 1}.\n- Visit 7: Reduce in-degree of 8. In-degrees: {8: 2}.\n- Visit 9: Reduce in-degree of 8 and 4. In-degrees: {8: 1, 4: 1}.\n- Queue: [1, 7, 9] -> [5, 4, 8] after visiting 1, 7, 9.\n- Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed Topological Sorting\n- Initial Queue: [1, 7, 9].\n- After visiting 1: Queue = [7, 9, 5] because 5's in-degree becomes 0.\n- After visiting 7: Queue = [9, 5] because 8's in-degree becomes 2, not 0.\n- After visiting 9: Queue = [5, 4, 8] because 4's and 8's in-degrees become 1 and 1 respectively (for 8, it was 2, now 1; for 4, it was 2, now 1).\n- After visiting 5: Queue = [4, 8, 2] because 6's in-degree becomes 4, and 2's in-degree was 1, now 0 (for 2).\n- After visiting 4: Queue = [8, 2, 3] because 3's in-degree becomes 2, not 0 (for 3), so it stays the same.\n- After visiting 8: Queue = [2, 3] because 6's in-degree becomes 4 (no change for 6).\n- After visiting 2: Queue = [3] because 5 and 6's in-degrees don't become 0.\n- After visiting 3: Queue = [] because 6 and 8's in-degrees don't become 0 (8 is already visited or not, but its neighbors are considered).\n- Total visited = 10.\n\n## Step 10: Check if all courses can be finished\nSince we visited 10 nodes (all courses), it's possible to finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' indicates that course 'a' requires course 'b'. The given prerequisites are: [(0, 2), (2, 6), (9, 8), (2, 5), (5, 6), (7, 8), (8, 6), (3, 6), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 8), (4, 3), (9, 4), (0, 4)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty graph as a dictionary where each key represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of its prerequisites. However, for detecting cycles, it's more convenient to directly store the courses that each course is a prerequisite for. So, we create a graph where the key is the course and the value is a list of courses that depend on it. The in-degree of each node (course) will also be tracked to identify nodes with no prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and in-degree dictionary\nWe initialize the graph and in-degree dictionary. For each prerequisite (a, b), 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a', so 'b' will be a key in the graph with 'a' in its list of values. The in-degree of 'a' will be incremented by 1.\n\n## Step 5: Populate the graph and calculate in-degrees\nFor each pair (a, b) in the prerequisites: [(0, 2), (2, 6), (9, 8), (2, 5), (5, 6), (7, 8), (8, 6), (3, 6), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 8), (4, 3), (9, 4), (0, 4)], we update the graph and in-degrees accordingly.\n\n## Step 6: Perform Topological Sorting\nTo check if all courses can be finished, we perform a topological sort. We start with courses that have an in-degree of 0 (no prerequisites), and gradually decrease the in-degree of their neighboring nodes (courses that depend on them) as we \"take\" them. If we can take all courses (i.e., reduce their in-degree to 0 at some point), then we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 7: Implement Topological Sorting\n1. Initialize a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, and for each of its neighbors (courses that it is a prerequisite for), decrease their in-degree by 1. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n3. Count the number of nodes dequeued. If it's equal to the total number of courses (10), then all courses can be finished.\n\n## Step 8: Execute the Topological Sorting\nLet's execute the steps with the given prerequisites.\n\n## Step 9: Calculation\nGiven prerequisites: [(0, 2), (2, 6), (9, 8), (2, 5), (5, 6), (7, 8), (8, 6), (3, 6), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 8), (4, 3), (9, 4), (0, 4)].\n\n- Graph: {2: [0], 6: [2, 5, 8, 3], 8: [9, 7, 3], 5: [2, 1], 3: [1, 4], 4: [9, 0]}\n- In-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 4, 7: 0, 8: 3, 9: 2}\n\nInitial queue: [1, 7] because they have an in-degree of 0.\n\n## Step 10: Topological Sorting Process\n1. Dequeue 1, decrease in-degree of 3 and 5. Now, in-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 0, 6: 4, 7: 0, 8: 3, 9: 2}. Queue: [7, 5].\n2. Dequeue 7, decrease in-degree of 8. Now, in-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 0, 6: 4, 7: 0, 8: 2, 9: 2}. Queue: [5].\n3. Dequeue 5, decrease in-degree of 2 and 6.

Now, in-degrees remain the same for its neighbors since we directly look at the courses it is a prerequisite for. Queue: [4].\n7. Dequeue 4, decrease in-degree of 0 and 9.

After taking 3, decrease in-degree of 1 by 1 (now 0).\n3. Now, courses with in-degree 0 are {1}.\n4. After taking 1, decrease in-degree of 0 and 4 by 1. So, 0 becomes 0 and 4 becomes 1.\n5. Now, courses with in-degree 0 are {0}.\n6. After taking 0, decrease in-degree of 4 by 1. So, 4 becomes 0.\n7. Now, courses with in-degree 0 are {4}.\n\n## Step 7: Check if all courses can be taken.\nWe were able to take all courses in the order: 2, 3, 1, 0, 4.

We have a list of prerequisites where each pair (a, b) means course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Create a graph representation of the courses and their prerequisites\nTo solve this, we need to create a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' represents that course 'a' requires course 'b'. The given prerequisites are [(0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)]. So, the graph will be constructed as follows:\n- Course 0 requires course 4.\n- Course 1 requires course 4 and course 0.\n- Course 3 requires course 1.\n- Course 2 requires course 0.\n\n## Step 3: Initialize the graph and in-degree array\nWe initialize an adjacency list to represent the graph and an array to keep track of the in-degree of each node (course). The graph and in-degree array are constructed based on the given prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Populate the graph and calculate in-degrees\nFor each prerequisite (a, b), we add an edge from 'b' to 'a' in the graph and increment the in-degree of 'a'. The graph will be:\n- Course 0: [4]\n- Course 1: [4, 0]\n- Course 2: [0]\n- Course 3: [1]\n- Course 4: []\n\nAnd the in-degrees are:\n- Course 0: 2 (requires 4 and indirectly 0 is required by others, but directly it's required by 2 and 1)\n- Course 1: 1\n- Course 2: 0\n- Course 3: 1\n- Course 4: 0\n\nLet's correct this step by actually populating the graph and in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [4], 1: [4, 0], 2: [0], 3: [1], 4: []} translates to an adjacency list representation where the keys are the courses and the values are lists of their prerequisites. However, for the algorithm, we actually need the reverse: {0: [2, 1], 1: [3], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [0, 1]}.\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 2} is incorrect based on the initial description. Correctly, it should be calculated as:\n- Course 0 is required by 2 and 1, so its in-degree is 2.\n- Course 1 is required by 3, so its in-degree is 1.\n- Course 2 is not required by anyone, so its in-degree is 0.\n- Course 3 is not required by anyone, so its in-degree is 0.\n- Course 4 is required by 0 and 1, so its in-degree is 2.\n\nCorrect in-degrees:\n- Course 0: 2\n- Course 1: 1\n- Course 2: 0\n- Course 3: 1\n- Course 4: 2\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting\nWe start with courses that have an in-degree of 0, which are Course 2 and Course 3. We use a queue to keep track of these courses. We then decrement the in-degree of their neighbors and add them to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the Topological Sorting algorithm\n1. Initialize a queue with courses having in-degree 0: [2, 3].\n2. While the queue is not empty:\n- Dequeue a course.\n- For each neighbor of the dequeued course, decrement its in-degree.\n- If the in-degree of a neighbor becomes 0, enqueue it.\n\nLet's execute this:\n- Queue = [2, 3]. In-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 2}.\n- Dequeue 2, decrement in-degree of 0. In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 2}. Queue = [3].\n- Dequeue 3, decrement in-degree of 1. In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 2}. Queue = [1].\n- Dequeue 1, decrement in-degree of 0 and 4. In-degrees: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 1}. Queue = [0].\n- Dequeue 0, decrement in-degree of 4. In-degrees: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0}. Queue = [4].\n- Dequeue 4, no more decrements. Queue = [].\n\n## Step 7: Check if all courses can be finished\nWe have visited all 5 courses (2, 3, 1, 0, 4), so it's possible to finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), where 'a' is the course that requires 'b' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this problem, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' indicates that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are: [(0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (5, 3), (4, 0), (5, 1), (2, 3), (6, 0)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nTo create the adjacency list, we iterate over the prerequisites. For each pair (a, b), we add 'a' to the list of nodes that 'b' points to. Initially, we have an empty graph: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: []}. After adding the edges based on the prerequisites: {0: [4, 6], 1: [0, 2, 3, 5], 2: [1], 3: [2, 5], 4: [], 5: [], 6: []} is incorrect because it represents the reverse. The correct representation should be based on the prerequisites given, so for (a, b), 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a', meaning 'b' should point to 'a'. Thus, the correct graph should be constructed as: {0: [4, 6], 1: [0, 2, 3, 5], 2: [], 3: [2, 5], 4: [], 5: [], 6: []} is still not correctly representing the given data. Let's correctly represent it: For (0,1), 1->0; for (2,1), 1->2; for (3,1), 1->3; for (5,3), 3->5; for (4,0), 0->4; for (5,1), 1->5; for (2,3), 3->2; for (6,0), 0->6.

Simplifying this with the correct interpretation: The graph should be {1: [0, 2, 3, 5], 0: [4, 6], 3: [5, 2], 5: [], 2: [], 4: [], 6: []}.\n\n## Step 4: Apply Topological Sorting to check if all courses can be finished\nTo check if all courses can be finished, we need to perform a topological sort on the graph. If there's a cycle in the graph, it means we cannot finish all courses. The steps involve calculating the in-degree of each node, then using a queue to process nodes with an in-degree of 0.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the in-degree of each node\nThe in-degree of a node is the number of edges pointing to it. For the given prerequisites: (0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (5, 3), (4, 0), (5, 1), (2, 3), (6, 0), we calculate the in-degree as follows:\n- Course 0 has in-degree 1 (from 1),\n- Course 1 has in-degree 0,\n- Course 2 has in-degree 2 (from 1 and 3),\n- Course 3 has in-degree 1 (from 1),\n- Course 4 has in-degree 1 (from 0),\n- Course 5 has in-degree 2 (from 3 and 1),\n- Course 6 has in-degree 1 (from 0).\nSo, in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1}.\n\n## Step 6: Perform Topological Sorting\nStart with nodes having an in-degree of 0. Here, course 1 has an in-degree of 0. We add it to the queue. Then, we process the queue, reducing the in-degree of neighboring nodes and adding them to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0.\n\n## Step 7: Execute the Topological Sorting\n1. Queue = [1] because 1 has an in-degree of 0.\n2. Process 1: Reduce in-degree of 0, 2, 3, 5. Now, in-degrees are: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1}. Queue = [0, 3].\n3. Process 0: Reduce in-degree of 4, 6. Now, in-degrees are: {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 1, 6: 0}. Queue = [3, 4, 6].\n4. Process 3: Reduce in-degree of 2, 5.

The steps involve calculating the in-degree of each node, then using a queue to process nodes with an in-degree of 0.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the in-degree of each node\nThe in-degree of a node is the number of edges pointing to it. For the given prerequisites: (0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (5, 3), (4, 0), (5, 1), (2, 3), (6, 0), we calculate the in-degree as follows:\n- Course 0 has in-degree 1 (from 1),\n- Course 1 has in-degree 0,\n- Course 2 has in-degree 2 (from 1 and 3),\n- Course 3 has in-degree 1 (from 1),\n- Course 4 has in-degree 1 (from 0),\n- Course 5 has in-degree 2 (from 3 and 1),\n- Course 6 has in-degree 1 (from 0).\nSo, in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1}.\n\n## Step 6: Perform Topological Sorting\nStart with nodes having an in-degree of 0.

In-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1}.\n- Start with node 1 (in-degree = 0).\n- Process node 1, decrease in-degrees of its neighbors: {0: 0, 2: 1, 3: 0, 5: 1}.\n- Now, nodes 0 and 3 have in-degree 0. Process them.\n- After processing 0: {4: 0, 6: 0}.\n- After processing 3: {2: 0, 5: 0}.\n- Now, nodes 4, 6, 2, 5 have in-degree 0. Process them.\n\n## Step 9: Finalize Topological Sorting\n- Process nodes in the order they become available (in-degree 0): 1, 0, 3, 4, 6, 2, 5.\n- All 7 courses are processed, indicating there's no cycle.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure.\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' indicates that course 'a' requires course 'b'. The given prerequisites are: [(3, 0), (4, 3), (2, 0), (1, 2)]. This translates to a graph where the edges are (0, 3), (3, 4), (0, 2), and (2, 1).\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph.\nTo create the adjacency list, we start with an empty graph and add edges based on the prerequisites. The graph will be represented as an adjacency list where each index represents a course, and its corresponding value is a list of courses that it is a prerequisite for. However, for detecting cycles, it's more useful to represent it as a list of prerequisites for each course. So, for course 0, the prerequisites are []; for course 1, the prerequisites are [2]; for course 2, the prerequisites are [0]; for course 3, the prerequisites are [0]; and for course 4, the prerequisites are [3]. Thus, the in-degree (number of prerequisites) for each course is: course 0 = 0, course 1 = 1, course 2 = 1, course 3 = 1, course 4 = 1.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the topological sorting algorithm to check for cycles.\nTopological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. If there's a cycle, topological sorting is not possible. We start by identifying nodes with an in-degree of 0 (no prerequisites), which are the starting points.\n\n## Step 5: Initialize the in-degree of each course and build the graph.\nThe in-degrees are as follows: course 0 = 0 (since no course requires 0), course 1 = 1 (requires 2), course 2 = 1 (requires 0), course 3 = 1 (requires 0), course 4 = 1 (requires 3). The graph represented as a list of courses that each course is a prerequisite for is not directly needed; instead, we focus on the in-degrees and the actual prerequisites for each course: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [0], 3: [0], 4: [3]}. The correct representation for our purpose is the in-degree count and the graph where each course is associated with its prerequisites.\n\n## Step 6: Perform topological sorting.\nFirst, identify courses with 0 in-degree: course 0. Then, iteratively remove these courses from the graph, reducing the in-degree of their neighboring courses (courses that require them). Initially, the queue contains course 0. After processing course 0, courses 2 and 3 will have their in-degrees reduced. So, the queue will be updated to include them if their in-degree becomes 0.\n\n## Step 7: Execute the topological sorting.\n1. Start with course 0 (in-degree = 0), so queue = [0]. After processing 0, the in-degrees of 2 and 3 become 0. So, queue = [0, 2, 3].\n2. Process 0: queue = [2, 3], in-degrees of 2 and 3 are 0.\n3. Process 2: queue = [3], in-degree of 1 becomes 0. So, queue = [3, 1].\n4. Process 3: queue = [1], in-degree of 4 becomes 0. So, queue = [1, 4].\n5. Process 1 and 4: Both have no more courses depending on them, so they are just removed from the queue.\n\n## Step 8: Check if all courses can be finished.\nWe started with 5 courses and were able to process them in the order that respects the prerequisites: 0, 2, 3, 1, 4.

The graph is represented as an adjacency list, and in-degrees are stored in a separate list. For each prerequisite (a, b), we add an edge from 'b' to 'a' in the graph and increment the in-degree of 'a'.\n\n## Step 4: Detect cycles using topological sorting\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we need to detect if there's a cycle in the graph. We use topological sorting for this. We start by adding all nodes with an in-degree of 0 to a queue. Then, we iteratively remove nodes from the queue, decrease the in-degree of their neighbors, and add neighbors with an in-degree of 0 to the queue. If we can remove all nodes, there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 5: Implement the topological sorting\nLet's implement the steps:\n- Initialize the graph and in-degrees.\n- For each prerequisite (a, b), add 'b' to the list of 'a's prerequisites in the graph and increment 'a's in-degree.\n- Add all courses with in-degree 0 to a queue.\n- While the queue is not empty, remove a course, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors, and add them to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0.\n- Count the number of courses removed. If it equals the total number of courses, return True; otherwise, return False.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the given prerequisites to the steps\nGiven prerequisites: [(4, 1), (0, 6), (0, 1), (3, 6), (5, 6), (6, 5), (2, 6), (5, 0), (1, 2), (0, 3), (5, 2), (1, 6)].\nLet's build the graph:\n- Course 0 requires 6, 1, 3.\n- Course 1 requires 2, 6.\n- Course 2 requires 6.\n- Course 3 requires 6.\n- Course 4 requires 1.\n- Course 5 requires 6, 0, 2.\n- Course 6 requires 5.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate in-degrees and initialize the queue\nIn-degrees: [0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4].\n- Course 4 has an in-degree of 1.\n\n## Step 8: Perform topological sorting\nStart with courses having in-degree 0. None initially, but we can start with those having the lowest in-degree and proceed.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed topological sorting\nLet's directly analyze the graph for cycles:\n- The presence of (6, 5) and (5, 6) indicates a cycle between courses 5 and 6.\n- This cycle makes it impossible to finish all courses because it creates a dependency loop.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion based on cycle detection\nSince there's a cycle (between 5 and 6), we cannot finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

We need to analyze these to understand the dependencies between courses.\n\n## Step 3: Create a graph from the prerequisites\nTo analyze the dependencies, we create a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' represents that course 'a' requires course 'b'. The graph based on the given prerequisites is:\n- Course 4 requires course 1\n- Course 0 requires courses 6, 1, 3\n- Course 3 requires course 6\n- Course 5 requires course 6\n- Course 6 requires course 5\n- Course 2 requires course 6\n- Course 5 requires courses 0, 2\n- Course 1 requires courses 2, 6\n\n## Step 4: Detect cycles in the graph\nTo determine if all courses can be finished, we need to check for cycles in the graph because a cycle indicates a set of courses that depend on each other, making it impossible to finish all of them.\n\n## Step 5: Build the adjacency list representation of the graph\nLet's construct the adjacency list:\n- Course 0: [6, 1, 3]\n- Course 1: [2, 6]\n- Course 2: [6]\n- Course 3: [6]\n- Course 4: [1]\n- Course 5: [6, 0, 2]\n- Course 6: [5]\n\n## Step 6: Apply Topological Sorting or Cycle Detection\nWe'll use cycle detection. First, let's correctly represent the graph as an adjacency list:\n- 0: [1, 3, 6]\n- 1: [2, 6]\n- 2: [6]\n- 3: [6]\n- 4: [1]\n- 5: [0, 2, 6]\n- 6: [5]\n\n## Step 7: Perform Cycle Detection using DFS\nTo detect a cycle, we can use DFS. We mark nodes as visited and check if we ever revisit a node that's currently being visited (i.e., in the current DFS path). If so, there's a cycle.\n\n## Step 8: Implement DFS for Cycle Detection\nLet's simplify the process by directly analyzing the presence of a cycle:\n- The presence of (6, 5) and (5, 6) directly indicates a cycle because they depend on each other.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the cycle\nCourses 5 and 6 are in a cycle because 5 requires 6 and 6 requires 5. This means it's impossible to take both courses.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nSince there's a cycle (between courses 5 and 6), and given that course 0, 2, and 3 also depend on course 6, and course 5 depends on course 6, and course 1 depends on course 6 (either directly or indirectly), the cycle involving 5 and 6 is critical. Other dependencies further complicate the graph but the direct cycle between 5 and 6 is sufficient to conclude that not all courses can be finished due to this cyclic dependency.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

So, the graph will be represented as an adjacency list where each index represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of its prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nThe in-degree of a node represents the number of prerequisites it has.

We use BFS to perform topological sorting. We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0 (no prerequisites), add them to a queue, and then iteratively remove nodes from the queue, reducing the in-degree of their neighbors. If we can remove all nodes, the graph is acyclic, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Implement the BFS algorithm\nFirst, we initialize the graph and in-degrees. The graph is represented as an adjacency list where graph[i] contains the courses that have 'i' as a prerequisite.

We will create an adjacency list to represent this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, initialize an empty adjacency list for 8 courses: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [], 7: []}. Then, populate it based on the prerequisites. For each (a, b), add 'b' to the list of 'a'. So, the adjacency list will be populated as follows:\n- For (6, 2), add 2 to 6's list: {6: [2], ...}\n- For (3, 7), add 7 to 3's list: {3: [7], ...}\n- Continuing this process for all pairs: (7, 5), (0, 2), (1, 5), (3, 2), (0, 7), (4, 7), (6, 5), (2, 5), (7, 2).\n\n## Step 4: Populate the adjacency list completely\nAfter going through all the prerequisites:\n- (6, 2): {6: [2]}\n- (3, 7): {3: [7]}\n- (7, 5): {7: [5]}\n- (0, 2): {0: [2]}\n- (1, 5): {1: [5]}\n- (3, 2): {3: [2, 7]}\n- (0, 7): {0: [2, 7]}\n- (4, 7): {4: [7]}\n- (6, 5): {6: [2, 5]}\n- (2, 5): {2: [5]}\n- (7, 2): {7: [5, 2]}\nSo, the adjacency list is: {0: [2, 7], 1: [5], 2: [5], 3: [7, 2], 4: [7], 5: [], 6: [2, 5], 7: [5, 2]}.\n\n## Step 5: Detect cycles in the graph using topological sorting or DFS\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we need to detect if there's a cycle in the graph. One way to do this is by using topological sorting. If we can topologically sort the graph, it means there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Apply topological sorting\nFirst, calculate the in-degree of each node (course):\n- In-degree of 0: 0 (no prerequisites directly listed for 0, but it's listed as having prerequisites)\n- In-degree of 1: 0\n- In-degree of 2: 3 (prerequisite for 0, 3, 6)\n- In-degree of 3: 0\n- In-degree of 4: 0\n- In-degree of 5: 4 (prerequisite for 1, 6, 2, 7)\n- In-degree of 6: 0\n- In-degree of 7: 4 (prerequisite for 0, 3, 4)\n\nLet's correctly calculate the in-degrees based on the given prerequisites:\n- 0 has prerequisites 2 and 7, so its in-degree is 2.\n- 1 has prerequisite 5, so its in-degree is 1.\n- 2 has prerequisites 5 and 7, so its in-degree is 2.\n- 3 has prerequisites 7 and 2, so its in-degree is 2.\n- 4 has prerequisite 7, so its in-degree is 1.\n- 5 has no prerequisites listed directly for it, but it's a prerequisite for others, so its in-degree is 0 (initially), but we need to count the edges pointing to it: (7, 5), (2, 5), so its in-degree is 2.\n- 6 has prerequisites 2 and 5, so its in-degree is 2.\n- 7 has prerequisites 5 and 2, so its in-degree is 2.\n\nCorrect in-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 2}.\n\n## Step 7: Perform topological sorting\nStart with nodes having an in-degree of 0. Here, none of the nodes have an in-degree of 0 initially, but we can still proceed by identifying nodes with the lowest in-degree and using a queue to process them.\n\n## Step 8: Check for cycles using the in-degree and adjacency list\nSince there are no nodes with in-degree 0, we directly check for cycles. The presence of a cycle can be detected by trying to reduce the in-degrees of nodes as we \"remove\" them from the graph. If at any point we cannot reduce the in-degree of any node to 0, it indicates a cycle.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the process by directly checking for cycles\nLet's directly analyze the graph for cycles. A cycle exists if there's a path that starts and ends at the same node. Looking at the prerequisites and the adjacency list, we can see potential cycles, such as 2 -> 5 -> 7 -> 2.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the specific cycle\nThe cycle 2 -> 5 -> 7 -> 2 indicates that there's a circular dependency.

The given prerequisites are: [(3, 0), (3, 1), (6, 4), (4, 5), (1, 2), (3, 2), (5, 3), (1, 5), (0, 4), (6, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (1, 0)].\n\n## Step 3: Build the graph and calculate the in-degree of each node\nFirst, we build the graph and calculate the in-degree of each node.\n- For each prerequisite (a, b), we add a directed edge from 'b' to 'a'.\n- The in-degree of a node 'a' is the number of edges pointing to 'a'.\n\n## Step 4: Apply Topological Sorting\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we apply topological sorting.\n- We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0 (no prerequisites).\n- We remove these nodes from the graph and decrease the in-degree of their neighbors.\n- We repeat this process until we have processed all nodes or we cannot proceed further because there are nodes remaining with an in-degree greater than 0.\n\n## Step 5: Implement the Topological Sorting\nLet's implement the steps:\n1. Build the graph: G = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: []}.\n2. Populate the graph based on prerequisites and calculate in-degrees.\n- (3, 0): G[0].append(3), in-degree[3] += 1.\n- (3, 1): G[1].append(3), in-degree[3] += 1.\n- (6, 4): G[4].append(6), in-degree[6] += 1.\n- (4, 5): G[5].append(4), in-degree[4] += 1.\n- (1, 2): G[2].append(1), in-degree[1] += 1.\n- (3, 2): G[2].append(3), in-degree[3] += 1.\n- (5, 3): G[3].append(5), in-degree[5] += 1.\n- (1, 5): G[5].append(1), in-degree[1] += 1.\n- (0, 4): G[4].append(0), in-degree[0] += 1.\n- (6, 5): G[5].append(6), in-degree[6] += 1.\n- (2, 0): G[0].append(2), in-degree[2] += 1.\n- (2, 5): G[5].append(2), in-degree[2] += 1.\n- (1, 0): G[0].append(1), in-degree[1] += 1.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate in-degrees\nAfter populating the graph:\n- in-degree[0] = 3 (from 1, 2, 4)\n- in-degree[1] = 3 (from 3, 5, 0)\n- in-degree[2] = 2 (from 1, 3)\n- in-degree[3] = 3 (from 0, 1, 2)\n- in-degree[4] = 2 (from 5, 0)\n- in-degree[5] = 3 (from 4, 1, 2)\n- in-degree[6] = 2 (from 4, 5)\n\nLet's correct the graph representation and in-degree calculation:\nG = {0: [3, 2, 1], 1: [3], 2: [1, 3], 3: [5], 4: [6, 0], 5: [4, 1, 2], 6: []}\nin-degree = {0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 1, 5: 3, 6: 2}\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\nStart with nodes having in-degree 0.\n- Initially, in-degree = {0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 1, 5: 3, 6: 2}.

The prerequisites are given as pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the Prerequisites as a Graph\nTo solve this, we need to represent the given prerequisites as a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' represents that course 'a' is a prerequisite of course 'b', or in other words, 'b' must be taken before 'a'. The given list is [(3, 0), (3, 1), (6, 4), (4, 5), (1, 2), (3, 2), (5, 3), (1, 5), (0, 4), (6, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (1, 0)]. We will correct the representation to reflect that (a, b) means 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'.\n\n## Step 3: Build the Graph\nFirst, let's correctly interpret the given prerequisites and build the graph. The graph will be represented as an adjacency list where graph[i] contains all the courses that have 'i' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate In-Degree of Each Node\nTo detect if there's a cycle, we'll use the concept of in-degree. The in-degree of a node (course) is the number of edges pointing to it, i.e., the number of prerequisites it has.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting\nWe'll apply topological sorting using a queue. Courses with an in-degree of 0 are added to the queue first because they have no prerequisites. As we process each course in the queue, we decrease the in-degree of its neighbors (courses that it is a prerequisite for) by 1. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, it's added to the queue.\n\n## Step 6: Check for Cycle\nIf we can process all courses (i.e., the size of the queue plus the courses processed equals the total number of courses), then there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses. Otherwise, there's a cycle, and we cannot finish all courses.\n\n## Step 7: Implement the Solution\nLet's implement the steps:\n- Create a graph and calculate in-degrees.\n- Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0.\n- Perform topological sorting.\n\nGiven prerequisites = [(3, 0), (3, 1), (6, 4), (4, 5), (1, 2), (3, 2), (5, 3), (1, 5), (0, 4), (6, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (1, 0)], let's build the graph and in-degrees.\n\n## Step 8: Execution\nLet's execute the plan with the given data:\n- Total courses = 7.\n- Prerequisites = [(3, 0), (3, 1), (6, 4), (4, 5), (1, 2), (3, 2), (5, 3), (1, 5), (0, 4), (6, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (1, 0)].\n\n## Step 9: Detailed Calculation\n1. Build the graph and calculate in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [3, 2, 1], 1: [3, 1], 2: [1, 3], 3: [5], 4: [6, 0], 5: [4, 1, 2, 6], 6: []}\n- Correcting for the actual representation: For each (a, b), 'a' depends on 'b', so we adjust our understanding to build the graph correctly.\n\nLet's directly calculate:\n- In-degrees: [3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 2] for courses [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] respectively.\n\n## Step 10: Topological Sorting\n- Initialize queue with courses having in-degree 0. None have in-degree 0, so we start with the given in-degrees.\n\n## Step 11: Actual Implementation\nLet's simplify:\n- The given list implies the following dependencies:\n- Course 3 depends on 0, 1, 2.\n- Course 6 depends on 4, 5.\n- Course 1 depends on 2, 5, 0.\n- Course 4 depends on 5.\n- Course 5 depends on 3.\n\nLet's directly check for cycles or apply topological sorting.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to 'a' indicates that 'a' requires 'b'. The given prerequisites are: [(3, 0), (3, 1), (6, 4), (4, 5), (1, 2), (3, 2), (5, 3), (1, 5), (0, 4), (6, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (1, 0)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, initialize an empty adjacency list for 7 courses: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: []}. Then, populate it based on the given prerequisites. For each pair (a, b), add 'b' to the list of 'a'. So, the adjacency list will be populated as follows:\n- For (3, 0), add 0 to 3's list: {3: [0], ...}\n- For (3, 1), add 1 to 3's list: {3: [0, 1], ...}\n- Continuing this process for all pairs: (3, 0), (3, 1), (6, 4), (4, 5), (1, 2), (3, 2), (5, 3), (1, 5), (0, 4), (6, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (1, 0).\nThe resulting adjacency list is:\n{0: [4], 1: [2, 5, 0], 2: [0, 5], 3: [0, 1, 2], 4: [5], 5: [3], 6: [4, 5]}.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nTo detect cycles, we calculate the in-degree of each node. The in-degree is the number of edges pointing to a node. For the given graph:\n- Course 0 has in-degree 3 (from 3, 2, 1).\n- Course 1 has in-degree 1 (from 3).\n- Course 2 has in-degree 2 (from 1, 3).\n- Course 3 has in-degree 1 (from 5).\n- Course 4 has in-degree 2 (from 6, 0).\n- Course 5 has in-degree 4 (from 4, 1, 2, 6).\n- Course 6 has in-degree 0.\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sorting using Kahn's Algorithm\nKahn's algorithm is used to check if a graph is acyclic (and thus if we can finish all courses). It works by:\n1. Initializing a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n2. For each node in the queue, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors by 1. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n3. Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty.\n4. If the number of nodes visited (i.e., the number of times we've dequeued a node) is equal to the total number of nodes, then the graph is acyclic.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Kahn's Algorithm to the given problem\n1. Start with Course 6 (in-degree = 0).\n2. Decrease in-degree of its neighbors (4, 5). Now, in-degrees are: 4 = 1, 5 = 3.\n3. Since 4's in-degree is now 1, it's not yet 0. Continue.\n4. The initial queue is [6].\n- Dequeue 6, decrease in-degree of 4 and 5. Now, 4 = 0, 5 = 3. Enqueue 4.\n- Dequeue 4, decrease in-degree of 5. Now, 5 = 2.\n- The queue is empty, but we haven't visited all nodes.\n\nLet's correct and simplify the steps for Kahn's algorithm:\n- Initialize queue with nodes having in-degree 0: [6].\n- In-degrees: {0: 3, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 4, 6: 0}.\n- Dequeue 6, neighbors are 4 and 5. Decrease their in-degrees: 4 = 1, 5 = 3. Enqueue 4 because its in-degree is now 1, not 0, so it waits.\n- Correcting the process: After dequeuing 6, we have 4 and 5 with decreased in-degrees. 4 is enqueued because its in-degree becomes 1, but it should be enqueued when its in-degree is 0.\n\n## Step 7: Correct the in-degree calculation and apply Kahn's Algorithm properly\nLet's directly calculate the in-degrees correctly and apply Kahn's algorithm:\n- In-degrees: {0: 3, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 4, 6: 0}.\nThe correct steps involve:\n1. Queue = [6] because 6 has an in-degree of 0.\n2. Dequeue 6, and for its neighbors (4, 5), decrease their in-degrees. Now, 4 = 1, 5 = 3. Since 4 is not 0, it's not added to the queue yet.\nLet's directly check for cycles or apply the algorithm correctly.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the process by directly checking for the possibility of finishing all courses\nTo simplify, let's directly analyze the graph for cycles or use the topological sorting.\n\nThe final in-degrees are:\n- 0: 3\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 2\n- 5: 4\n- 6: 0\n\nStarting with 6 (in-degree 0):\n- Dequeue 6. Neighbors: 4, 5. In-degrees: 4 = 1, 5 = 3.\n- Enqueue 4 (when its in-degree is 0). Currently, it's 1.\n\nLet's analyze the presence of a cycle directly:\nThere's a cycle if we cannot visit all nodes.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the graph for cycles\nUpon closer inspection:\n- The presence of a cycle can be detected by checking if there's a path that starts and ends at the same node.\n- A cycle exists: 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 (or other similar cycles).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The given prerequisites are [(4, 6), (3, 6), (1, 0), (0, 6), (0, 3), (2, 3), (5, 4)]. We will construct an adjacency list to represent this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Construct the adjacency list\nTo construct the adjacency list, we iterate over the prerequisites.

The graph will be represented as an adjacency list where graph[i] contains all the courses that are prerequisites for course 'i'.

The in-degree of a node is the number of edges entering it. We calculate the in-degree for each course:\n- in-degree[0] = 1 (because 1 requires 0)\n- in-degree[1] = 0\n- in-degree[2] = 1 (because 2 requires 3)\n- in-degree[3] = 2 (because 0 and 2 require 3)\n- in-degree[4] = 1 (because 5 requires 4)\n- in-degree[5] = 0\n- in-degree[6] = 4 (because 4, 3, 0 require 6 directly or indirectly, but directly: 0, 3, 4 require 6)\n\nCorrecting the understanding of in-degree calculation based on direct prerequisites:\n- For (4, 6), in-degree[6] += 1\n- For (3, 6), in-degree[6] += 1\n- For (1, 0), in-degree[0] += 1\n- For (0, 6), in-degree[6] += 1\n- For (0, 3), in-degree[3] += 1\n- For (2, 3), in-degree[3] += 1\n- For (5, 4), in-degree[4] += 1\nSo, the correct in-degrees are:\n- in-degree[0] = 1\n- in-degree[1] = 0\n- in-degree[2] = 0\n- in-degree[3] = 2\n- in-degree[4] = 1\n- in-degree[5] = 0\n- in-degree[6] = 3\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sorting\nWe start by adding all nodes with an in-degree of 0 to a queue.

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), where 'a' is the course that requires 'b' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the prerequisites as a graph\nTo solve this, we need to represent the given prerequisites as a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from 'b' to 'a' indicates that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are [(4, 6), (3, 6), (1, 0), (0, 6), (0, 3), (2, 3), (5, 4)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nTo create the adjacency list, we iterate through the prerequisites:\n- For (4, 6), add 6 to the list of 4's prerequisites, so 6 -> 4.\n- For (3, 6), add 6 to the list of 3's prerequisites, so 6 -> 3.\n- For (1, 0), add 0 to the list of 1's prerequisites, so 0 -> 1.\n- For (0, 6), add 6 to the list of 0's prerequisites, so 6 -> 0.\n- For (0, 3), add 3 to the list of 0's prerequisites, so 3 -> 0.\n- For (2, 3), add 3 to the list of 2's prerequisites, so 3 -> 2.\n- For (5, 4), add 4 to the list of 5's prerequisites, so 4 -> 5.\n\nThe correct interpretation is that we are building a graph where the edge is from the prerequisite to the course. So, the graph will be represented as:\n- Course 0 has prerequisites [6, 3]\n- Course 1 has prerequisites [0]\n- Course 2 has prerequisites [3]\n- Course 3 has prerequisites [6]\n- Course 4 has prerequisites [6]\n- Course 5 has prerequisites [4]\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nTo detect if there's a cycle, we'll use the concept of in-degree. The in-degree of a node is the number of edges pointing to it.\n- Course 0: in-degree = 2 (from 1 and indirectly, but directly from none; it has 6 and 3 as prerequisites)\n- Course 1: in-degree = 1 (from 0)\n- Course 2: in-degree = 1 (from 3)\n- Course 3: in-degree = 2 (from 0 and 2)\n- Course 4: in-degree = 1 (from 5)\n- Course 5: in-degree = 0\n- Course 6: in-degree = 3 (from 4, 3, and 0)\n\nLet's correct the understanding of in-degree based on the given prerequisites:\n- The actual in-degrees based on the given pairs are calculated by counting the occurrences of each course as 'a_i' (the second element in the pair (a_i, b_i)).\n\n## Step 5: Correctly calculate the in-degree of each course\nLet's directly calculate the in-degree:\n- Course 0 is 'a_i' in (1, 0), so its in-degree = 1.\n- Course 1 is not 'a_i' in any pair, so its in-degree = 0.\n- Course 2 is 'a_i' in (2, 3), so its in-degree = 1 (from 3, but actually, it's the other way around, 3 is a prerequisite for 2, so 2's in-degree is 1 because of (2,3)).\n- Course 3 is 'a_i' in (0, 3) and (2, 3), so its in-degree = 2.\n- Course 4 is 'a_i' in (5, 4), so its in-degree = 1.\n- Course 5 is not 'a_i' in any pair, so its in-degree = 0.\n- Course 6 is 'a_i' in (4, 6), (3, 6), and (0, 6), so its in-degree = 3.\n\nCorrect in-degrees:\n- Course 0: 1\n- Course 1: 0\n- Course 2: 1\n- Course 3: 2\n- Course 4: 1\n- Course 5: 0\n- Course 6: 3\n\n## Step 6: Perform Topological Sorting\nStart with courses that have an in-degree of 0. We have Course 1 and Course 5 with in-degree 0.\n- Initially, queue = [1, 5]\n- Dequeue 1, decrease in-degree of 0 by 1. Now, 0's in-degree = 0.\n- Dequeue 5, decrease in-degree of 4 by 1. Now, 4's in-degree = 0.\n- Enqueue 0 and 4. Queue = [0, 4]\n- Dequeue 0, decrease in-degree of 1 (already done), 3 by 1. Now, 3's in-degree = 1.\n- Dequeue 4, decrease in-degree of 6 by 1. Now, 6's in-degree = 2.\n- Enqueue 3 (since its in-degree is now 1, it's not ready yet). We actually enqueue it after its in-degree becomes 0.\n- Continue this process.\n\nLet's simplify:\n- Queue = [1, 5]\n- After processing 1 and 5, we have 0 and 4 ready. So, queue = [0, 4].\n- After 0, we have 3's in-degree = 1. After 4, 6's in-degree = 2.\n- So, queue = [3, 2] is not correct because 2's in-degree is still 1. We actually have queue = [2] after 3 is processed (but 3 is not ready yet).\n- Correct sequence: After 1 and 5, we have 0 and 4. After 0, 3 is not ready. After 4, 6 is not ready.\n\nLet's directly apply the topological sorting:\n1. Start with courses having in-degree 0: 1, 5.\n2. Process them, and update in-degrees.\n\n## Step 7: Execute Topological Sorting\n1. Queue = [1, 5]. Count = 2.\n2. Dequeue 1, in-degree[0]--. Queue = [5, 0] (after processing 1).\n3. Dequeue 5, in-degree[4]--. Queue = [0, 4] (after processing 5).\n4. Dequeue 0, in-degree[3]--. Queue = [4, 2] (after processing 0, because 3's in-degree becomes 1 and 2 is already ready).\n5. Dequeue 4, in-degree[6]--. Queue = [2, ?] (after processing 4).\n6. Dequeue 2, in-degree[3]--. Now, 3's in-degree = 0. Queue = [3].\n7. Dequeue 3, in-degree[6]--. Now, 6's in-degree = 1. Queue = [6].\n8. Dequeue 6. Count = 7.\n\nThe final count is 7, which means all courses can be finished.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The given prerequisites are [(4, 5), (4, 1), (1, 5), (3, 5), (0, 4), (2, 4), (4, 3), (5, 0)].\n\n## Step 3: Build the Graph and Calculate In-Degrees\nFirst, we build the graph and calculate the in-degree of each node (course). The in-degree of a node is the number of edges pointing to it, representing the number of prerequisites for that course.\n\n- For (4, 5), (4, 1), (1, 5), (3, 5), (0, 4), (2, 4), (4, 3), (5, 0), the graph and in-degrees are calculated as follows:\n- Graph: {0: [4], 1: [5], 2: [4], 3: [5], 4: [1, 3], 5: [0]}\n- However, to correctly represent the given prerequisites: \n- 4 requires 5 and 1, \n- 1 requires 5, \n- 3 requires 5, \n- 0 requires 4, \n- 2 requires 4, \n- 4 requires 3 (and 1, and 5 indirectly through 3 and 1),\n- 5 requires 0.\nSo, the correct graph should be represented as an adjacency list where the key is the course and the value is a list of its prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Correctly Build the Adjacency List and In-Degree Dictionary\nLet's correctly build the graph:\n- Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n- Prerequisites: [(4, 5), (4, 1), (1, 5), (3, 5), (0, 4), (2, 4), (4, 3), (5, 0)]\n\nThe adjacency list (where each course is a key and its value is a list of courses it requires) is:\n- 0: [4]\n- 1: [5]\n- 2: [4]\n- 3: [5]\n- 4: [5, 1, 3]\n- 5: [0]\n\nAnd the in-degree dictionary:\n- 0: 1 (because 5 requires 0)\n- 1: 1 (because 4 requires 1)\n- 2: 0\n- 3: 1 (because 4 requires 3)\n- 4: 3 (because 0, 2, and indirectly others require 4, but directly it's required by 0 and 2)\n- 5: 3 (because 4, 1, and 3 require 5)\n\nCorrecting the understanding:\n- The graph should be represented as: {4: [5, 1, 3], 1: [5], 3: [5], 0: [4], 2: [4], 5: [0]}\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3}\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting\nTo check if all courses can be finished, we apply topological sorting.

Initialize a queue with course 2.\n2. As we process each course in the queue, we decrease the in-degree of its neighboring courses (the courses that require it) by 1.\n3.

We calculate it by iterating through the prerequisites:\n- 0 has an in-degree of 1 (from 5).\n- 1 has an in-degree of 1 (from 4).\n- 2 has an in-degree of 0.\n- 3 has an in-degree of 1 (from 4).\n- 4 has an in-degree of 3 (from 0, 2, and implicitly from the prerequisites given).\n- 5 has an in-degree of 3 (from 1, 3, and 4).\n\nLet's correctly count the in-degrees based on the given prerequisites:\n- 0: 1 (5->0)\n- 1: 1 (4->1)\n- 2: 1 (no, it's 1 because of 2->4 is not counted, but there's (2,4), so 4 has an edge from 2, meaning 2 has 0 in-degree directly related to its own prerequisites, but it has 1 edge pointing to it from nowhere, actually it has 0)\n- 3: 1 (4->3)\n- 4: 3 (0->4, 2->4, 4 has 3 prerequisites: 0, 2, and none directly, but it has 1, 3, 5 as prerequisites, so let's recount: 0->4, 2->4, so 4 has at least 2, and indeed (4,1), (4,3) imply 1 and 3 are prerequisites, but we count the edges pointing to 4: (0,4), (2,4), so 2)\n- 5: 3 (1->5, 3->5, 4->5)\n\nCorrecting the understanding:\n- The correct in-degrees based on the given list are calculated as follows:\n1.

We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0, and gradually decrease the in-degree of neighboring nodes as we \"visit\" them.\n\n## Step 6: Perform Topological Sorting\n1. Start with nodes having in-degree 0. Here, node 2 has an in-degree of 0.\n2. Decrease the in-degree of neighboring nodes of 2. So, 4's in-degree becomes 1 (from 2).\n3. Now, nodes with in-degree 0 are 2. After visiting 2, we have 2 as visited, and 4's in-degree is 1. So, we can visit 4 next because its in-degree is now 1, and after visiting 4, we decrease the in-degree of its neighbors (0, 1, 3).\n\nLet's continue the process:\n- Visit 2 (in-degree 0), decrease in-degree of 4 to 1.\n- Now, we have 2 visited. The in-degrees are: 0:1, 1:1, 2:0 (visited), 3:1, 4:1, 5:3.\n- Visit 4 (in-degree 1), decrease in-degree of 0, 1, 3. So, 0:0, 1:0, 3:0.\n- Now, we can visit 0, 1, 3 because their in-degrees are 0.\n- After visiting 0, 1, 3, we decrease the in-degree of their neighbors. So, 4's in-degree was already counted, 5's in-degree decreases by 3 (because 1, 3, and 4 are prerequisites of 5 or have an edge to it directly or indirectly, but directly it's just 1 and 3 and 4).\n\nLet's simplify and directly analyze the graph for cycles or apply the algorithm correctly:\n- The nodes with 0 in-degree initially are 2.\n- After visiting 2, we have 4 with in-degree 1.\n- Visiting 4, we decrease the in-degree of 0, 1, 3.\n- Then, we can visit 0, 1, 3.\n- After visiting 0, 1, 3, we look at 5. It has an in-degree of 3 (from 1, 3, 4).\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the presence of cycles\nUpon closer inspection, there's a cycle: 0->4, 4->1, 1->5, 5->0.

First, calculate the in-degree of each node (course):\n- In-degree of 0 = 1 (since 5 requires 0)\n- In-degree of 1 = 1 (since 4 requires 1)\n- In-degree of 2 = 1 (since no course directly requires 2, but 2 requires 4)\n- In-degree of 3 = 1 (since 4 requires 3)\n- In-degree of 4 = 3 (since 0, 2 require 4)\n- In-degree of 5 = 3 (since 1, 3, 4 require 5)\n\nLet's correct the in-degree calculation based on the given prerequisites:\n- 0 requires 4 and 5 requires 0, so 0 has in-degree 1.\n- 1 requires 5, and 4 requires 1, so 1 has in-degree 1.\n- 2 requires 4, so 2 has in-degree 0.\n- 3 requires 5, and 4 requires 3, so 3 has in-degree 1.\n- 4 requires 1, 3, and 5, and 0, 2 require 4, so 4 has in-degree 3.\n- 5 requires 0, and 1, 3, 4 require 5, so 5 has in-degree 1.\n\nCorrect in-degrees:\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 0\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 3\n- 5: 3 (since 4, 1, 3 require 5)\n\n## Step 6: Perform Kahn's algorithm\n1. Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0. Here, it's course 2.\n2. Dequeue a node, reduce the in-degree of its neighbors by 1, and enqueue any neighbor that now has an in-degree of 0.\n- Start with course 2 (in-degree 0). Reduce in-degree of 4 by 1. So, 4's in-degree becomes 2.\n- Queue = [2], visited = 1.\n\n## Step 7: Continue Kahn's algorithm\n- Dequeue 2. Neighbors: 4. In-degree of 4 = 2.\n- Now, queue is empty, but we have other nodes with in-degree 0 or potentially becoming 0. Let's directly analyze the graph for cycles or continue the algorithm properly.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given graph for simplicity:\nThe graph has the following edges based on prerequisites: (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0).\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the analysis by directly checking for cycles\nUpon closer inspection, there's a cycle: 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 0. This indicates that it's impossible to finish all courses because of the cyclic dependency.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The given prerequisites are [(4, 2), (6, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 5), (1, 5), (5, 0), (3, 6)]. We will represent this as an adjacency list.\n\n## Step 3: Build the adjacency list\nFor each prerequisite (a, b), we add an edge from 'b' to 'a' in our graph. So, the graph will be constructed as follows:\n- Course 0 has no prerequisites directly given, but it's a prerequisite for others.\n- Course 1 requires 0 and 5.\n- Course 2 requires 0.\n- Course 3 requires 5 and 6.\n- Course 4 requires 2.\n- Course 5 requires 0.\n- Course 6 requires 5.\n\nLet's construct the graph:\n- 0: [1, 2, 5]\n- 1: []\n- 2: [4]\n- 3: []\n- 4: []\n- 5: [1, 3, 6]\n- 6: [3]\n\nCorrecting the understanding of the graph construction based on the given prerequisites:\n- For (4, 2), (6, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 5), (1, 5), (5, 0), (3, 6), the correct graph is:\n- 0: [1, 2, 5]\n- 1: []\n- 2: [4]\n- 3: []\n- 4: []\n- 5: [1, 3, 6]\n- 6: [3]\n\n## Step 4: Apply the correct method to construct the graph\nLet's correctly construct the graph based on the given prerequisites:\n- The graph should be {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: []} initially.\n- For each (a, b), add 'a' to the list of nodes that 'b' points to.

We also need to calculate the in-degree of each node (course), which is the number of edges pointing to it.\n\n## Step 4: Apply Topological Sorting\nTopological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. If we can topologically sort the graph, it means we can finish all courses. We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0, add them to the sorted list, and then decrease the in-degree of their neighbors. We repeat this process until we've processed all nodes or we can't proceed further.\n\n## Step 5: Check for cycles by verifying the number of visited nodes\nIf the graph contains a cycle, we won't be able to visit all nodes (courses) because a cycle means there's a course that depends on another course which in turn depends on the first course, either directly or indirectly, creating an impossible situation. The number of visited nodes should be equal to the total number of courses if there's no cycle.\n\n## Step 6: Implement the solution\nLet's construct the graph and apply topological sorting:\n- Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n- Prerequisites: [(4, 2), (6, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 5), (1, 5), (5, 0), (3, 6)]\n\nFirst, we initialize the graph and in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [1, 2, 5], 1: [], 2: [4], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [1, 3, 6], 6: [3]}\n- In-degrees: {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1}\n\nCorrecting the graph and in-degrees based on the given prerequisites:\n- The correct graph is: {0: [1, 2, 5], 1: [0, 5], 2: [4], 3: [5, 6], 4: [], 5: [1, 3, 6], 6: [3]}\n- Correct in-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 2}\n\nLet's correct the understanding of the graph and in-degrees:\n- The graph should be constructed as follows:\n0 -> 1, 0 -> 2, 0 -> 5 (because (1,0), (2,0), (5,0))\n1 -> None\n2 -> 4 (because (4,2))\n3 -> None\n4 -> None\n5 -> 1, 5 -> 3, 5 -> 6 (because (1,5), (3,5), (6,5))\n6 -> 3 (because (3,6))\n\nSo, the correct adjacency list is:\n- 0: [1, 2, 5]\n- 1: []\n- 2: [4]\n- 3: []\n- 4: []\n- 5: [1, 3, 6]\n- 6: [3]\n\nAnd the in-degrees are:\n- 0: 0\n- 1: 2 (because of 0 and 5)\n- 2: 1 (because of 0)\n- 3: 2 (because of 5 and 6)\n- 4: 1 (because of 2)\n- 5: 1 (because of 0)\n- 6: 1 (because of 5)\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\nStart with nodes having in-degree 0. Here, 0 is the only node with in-degree 0.\n- Visit 0, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (1, 2, 5). Now, in-degrees are: 1:1, 2:0, 5:0.\n- Next, visit nodes with in-degree 0, which are now 2 and 5. After visiting them, update in-degrees.\n- After visiting 2, its neighbor 4's in-degree decreases to 0.\n- After visiting 5, its neighbors (1, 3, 6)'s in-degrees decrease. Now, 1:0, 3:1, 6:0.\n- Continue this process.\n\n## Step 8: Execute Topological Sorting\n1. Start with 0 (in-degree = 0), decrease in-degrees of 1, 2, 5.\n- In-degrees: 1:1, 2:0, 3:2, 4:1, 5:0, 6:1\n2.

We initialize a queue with these nodes.\n\n## Step 8: Perform Topological Sorting\nWe dequeue a node, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors by 1, and enqueue any neighbor that now has an in-degree of 0. We repeat this until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 9: Check if All Courses Can Be Finished\nIf we've visited (or dequeued) 9 nodes (all courses), it means we can finish all courses. Otherwise, there's a cycle, and we cannot finish all courses.\n\n## Step 10: Execution\nLet's execute the topological sorting:\n- Initial queue: [4, 5, 8]\n- In-degrees: {0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 0}\n- Dequeue 4, decrease in-degree of 0: {0: 3, ...}\n- Dequeue 5, decrease in-degree of 0 and 6: {0: 2, 6: 1, ...}\n- Dequeue 8, decrease in-degree of 0 and 1: {0: 1, 1: 2, ...}\n- Queue: [0] after processing 4, 5, 8.\n- Continue this process.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed Topological Sorting\n- Queue: [4, 5, 8]\n- Dequeue 4: {0: 3}, enqueue none.\n- Dequeue 5: {0: 2, 6: 1}, enqueue none.\n- Dequeue 8: {0: 1, 1: 2}, enqueue none.\n- Queue: [0]\n- Dequeue 0: {1: 1, 2: 0}, enqueue 2.\n- Queue: [2]\n- Dequeue 2: {3: 0}, enqueue 3.\n- Queue: [3, 1]\n- Dequeue 3: {6: 0}, enqueue 6.\n- Queue: [1, 6]\n- Dequeue 1: {}, enqueue none.\n- Dequeue 6: {7: 0}, enqueue 7.\n- Queue: [7]\n- Dequeue 7: {}, enqueue none.\n\n## Step 12: Count Visited Nodes\nWe've dequeued: 4, 5, 8, 0, 2, 3, 1, 6, 7.

Initialize a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, decrease the in-degree of all its neighbors by 1, and enqueue any neighbor whose in-degree becomes 0.\n3. If we can dequeue all nodes (i.e., the size of the visited set or the number of nodes dequeued equals the total number of nodes), then the graph has no cycles, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Kahn's algorithm to the given problem\nLet's apply Kahn's algorithm:\n- Total courses = 9.\n- Prerequisites = [(5, 6), (4, 0), (6, 3), (8, 0), (0, 2), (3, 2), (2, 1), (7, 6), (0, 1), (5, 0), (8, 1)].\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the in-degree and create the adjacency list\nCreating the adjacency list and calculating in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [4, 5, 8], 1: [0, 2, 8], 2: [0, 3], 3: [2, 6], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [5, 7], 7: [], 8: []} is incorrect based on the given prerequisites.

The correct representation should be derived directly from the given prerequisites.\n\nLet's directly calculate:\n- In-degrees: {0: 3, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 0}.\n\n## Step 7: Execute Kahn's algorithm\n1. Queue = [4, 8] because they have an in-degree of 0.\n2. Dequeue 4, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (0), so 0's in-degree becomes 2.\n3. Dequeue 8, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (0, 1, 5), so 0's in-degree becomes 1, 1's becomes 2, and 5's becomes 1.\n4. Queue = [0, 5] after step 3 (since 4 and 8 are dequeued), but actually, it should be [5] because 0's in-degree is still not 0.\n5.

Queue = [0] (since 5 is dequeued and its neighbor 6's in-degree is decreased), 0's in-degree is 1, dequeue 0, decrease in-degree of 1 and 2, so 1's becomes 1, and 2's becomes 1.\n7.

The given prerequisites are: [(5, 6), (4, 0), (6, 3), (8, 0), (0, 2), (3, 2), (2, 1), (7, 6), (0, 1), (5, 0), (8, 1)].

For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a's prerequisites. So, the graph will be represented as {course: [list of prerequisites]}.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nThe in-degree of a node represents how many prerequisites it has. We need this to identify courses that have no prerequisites and can be taken first.\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sorting using BFS\nTopological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. We use BFS to perform topological sorting. We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0, add them to a queue, and then iteratively remove nodes from the queue, decreasing the in-degree of their neighbors. If we can remove all nodes, the graph is a DAG, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Implement the Topological Sorting\nFirst, we initialize the graph and in-degrees. Then, we populate the graph and calculate in-degrees based on the given prerequisites. We use a queue to store nodes with in-degree 0 and perform BFS.\n\n## Step 7: Check if all courses can be finished\nIf the count of visited nodes (or the number of nodes removed from the queue) equals the total number of courses, it means we can finish all courses.

Otherwise, we return False.\n\nThe final steps involve actual calculation:\n- Initial queue: [4, 5, 7, 8] because their in-degrees are 0.\n- Processing these, we update in-degrees and add new nodes to the queue as their in-degrees become 0.\n\nLet's directly calculate:\n- In-degrees: {0: 3, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 0}\n- Queue: [4, 5, 7, 8]\n- Processing 4: in-degree of 0 becomes 2.\n- Processing 5: in-degree of 0 becomes 1, in-degree of 6 becomes 1.\n- Processing 7: in-degree of 6 becomes 0.\n- Processing 8: in-degree of 0 becomes 1, in-degree of 1 becomes 2.\n- Queue now: [6] because its in-degree is now 0.\n- Processing 6: in-degree of 3 becomes 0.\n- Queue now: [3, 0] (after processing 6).\n- Processing 3: in-degree of 2 becomes 0.\n- Queue now: [0, 2] (after processing 3).\n- Processing 0: in-degree of 2 becomes -1 (but we stop at 0), in-degree of 1 becomes 1.\n- Processing 2: in-degree of 1 becomes 0.\n- Queue now: [1].\n- Processing 1: No more nodes to process.\n\nCount of visited nodes = 9.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are represented as pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the Prerequisites as a Graph\nTo analyze the prerequisites, we represent them as a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' represents that course 'a' requires course 'b'. So, for each prerequisite (a, b), we add a directed edge from 'b' to 'a'.\n\n## Step 3: Build the Graph\nLet's build the graph based on the given prerequisites:\n- (3, 1) => 1 -> 3\n- (4, 0) => 0 -> 4\n- (5, 0) => 0 -> 5\n- (5, 1) => 1 -> 5\n- (0, 5) => 5 -> 0\n- (3, 2) => 2 -> 3\n- (4, 2) => 2 -> 4\n- (0, 3) => 3 -> 0\n- (1, 5) => 5 -> 1\n- (0, 1) => 1 -> 0\n- (2, 1) => 1 -> 2\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the Graph for Cycles\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we need to detect if there's a cycle in the graph.

This is a classic problem of detecting a cycle in a directed graph, where courses are represented as nodes, and prerequisites are represented as directed edges.\n\n## Step 1: Create a Graph Representation\nFirst, we create a graph where each node represents a course, and a directed edge from node $b$ to node $a$ indicates that course $b$ is a prerequisite for course $a$. The given prerequisites are: [(3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (0, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (0, 3), (1, 5), (0, 1), (2, 1)]. We will represent the graph as an adjacency list.\n\n## Step 2: Populate the Adjacency List\nTo populate the adjacency list, we iterate over each prerequisite. For each prerequisite $(a, b)$, we add an edge from $b$ to $a$ in our graph. So, the adjacency list will be populated as follows:\n- For course 0: [4, 5, 0, 3, 1] (since (4,0), (5,0), (0,5) implies a cycle, and (0,3), (0,1))\n- For course 1: [3, 5, 1, 2] (since (3,1), (5,1), (1,5), and (2,1))\n- For course 2: [3, 4, 1] (since (3,2), (4,2), and (2,1))\n- For course 3: [0] (since (0,3))\n- For course 4: [0] (since no course is a prerequisite for 4 directly from the list, but (4,0) indicates 0 is a prerequisite for 4, so we actually look at the reverse)\n- For course 5: [0, 1] (since (0,5) and (1,5))\n\nLet's correct the understanding of how to populate the graph:\n- Course 3 has prerequisites 1, 2.\n- Course 4 has prerequisites 0, 2.\n- Course 5 has prerequisites 0, 1.\n- Course 0 has prerequisites 5, 3, 1.\n- Course 1 has prerequisites 5, 2.\n\n## Step 3: Correctly Represent the Graph\nLet's correctly represent the graph:\n- Course 0: [4, 5, 0, 3, 1] is incorrect.

We need to keep track of the nodes we're currently visiting (in the current DFS path) and the nodes we've already visited.\n\n## Step 4: Implement DFS\nLet's implement DFS:\n1. Create a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n2. Create a set to keep track of nodes in the current DFS path.\n3.

The presence of such cycles indicates that it's impossible to finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Checking for Cycles\nLet's directly check for cycles using the given prerequisites without explicitly drawing the graph:\n- There's a cycle between 0 and 5 (0->5 and 5->0 directly or indirectly).\n- The exact graph representation isn't necessary; we can directly apply cycle detection.\n\nThe final step is to determine if there's a cycle.

Queue = [1, 7] because they have an in-degree of 0.\n2. Dequeue 1: Decrease in-degree of 2 and 3. Queue = [7]. In-degrees: {2: 2, 3: 0}.\n3. Dequeue 7: Decrease in-degree of 0 and 5. Queue = [3]. In-degrees: {0: 0, 5: 3}.\n4. Dequeue 3: Decrease in-degree of 2 and 6. Queue = [0]. In-degrees: {2: 1, 6: 0}.\n5. Dequeue 0: Decrease in-degree of 4 and 2. Queue = [6]. In-degrees: {4: 0, 2: 0}.\n6.

Queue = [5].\n\n## Step 7: Check if all nodes are visited\nWe've dequeued 1, 7, 3, 0, 6, 4, 2, 5 - a total of 8 nodes.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), where 'a' is the course that requires 'b' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to 'a' indicates that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are: [(3, 6), (1, 2), (0, 4), (7, 5), (3, 2), (1, 3), (7, 0), (0, 2), (6, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty graph as a dictionary where each key represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of its prerequisites or neighbors. Then, we populate this graph based on the given prerequisites.\n\nFor each pair (a, b), 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a', so 'b' will be added to the list of nodes that have an edge to 'a'. However, to detect cycles, it's more convenient to directly count the in-degrees of nodes and build the graph.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node and build the graph\nWe create a graph where each key is a course and its value is a list of courses that it is a prerequisite for. We also count the in-degree of each course.\n\n- For (3, 6), the graph will have 6: [3], and in-degree of 3 will be 1.\n- For (1, 2), the graph will have 2: [1], and in-degree of 1 will be 1.\n- Continuing this process for all pairs, we get the graph and in-degrees.\n\nLet's directly implement this:\n- Graph = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [], 7: []}\n- In-degrees = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0}\n\nAfter processing the prerequisites:\n- Graph = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [1, 3, 0], 3: [1], 4: [0], 5: [7, 6, 2, 4, 0], 6: [3], 7: []} is incorrect representation. Correct representation should be based on prerequisites.\n- Correct Graph representation should be: {2: [1, 3, 0], 3: [1], 4: [0], 5: [7, 2, 4, 6], 6: [3], 0: [7]}\n- In-degrees = {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 4, 6: 1, 7: 1}\n\nLet's correct the understanding:\n- The correct way to represent the graph is to have the course as the key and the list of courses that depend on it as the value. So, for (a, b), 'b' is the key and 'a' is added to its list.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting to check for cycles\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we apply topological sorting. We start with courses that have an in-degree of 0, as they have no prerequisites.\n\n## Step 6: Initialize the queue with nodes having in-degree 0\nWe identify courses with 0 in-degree. Initially, In-degrees = {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 4, 6: 1, 7: 1}. So, none of the courses have 0 in-degree initially except possibly those not listed.\n\nLet's correctly calculate in-degrees and build the graph:\n- For each (a, b), increment in-degree of 'a' and add 'a' to the list of 'b' in the graph.\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\nLet's directly calculate:\n- Graph = {0: [7], 1: [], 2: [1, 3, 0], 3: [1], 4: [0], 5: [], 6: [3], 7: [5]}\n- In-degrees = {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0, 5: 1, 6: 0, 7: 1}\n\nQueue = [2, 4, 6] because they have 0 in-degree.\n\n## Step 8: Process the queue\nWe dequeue a course, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors, and enqueue them if their in-degree becomes 0.\n\n## Step 9: Check if all courses can be finished\nIf we can visit all nodes (courses), then there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses.\n\nLet's simplify:\n- Initial Queue = [2, 4, 6]\n- Process 2: Decrease in-degree of 1, 3, 0. In-degrees = {0: 0, 1: 0, 3: 1}. Queue = [4, 6, 1, 0]\n- Process 4: Decrease in-degree of 0. In-degrees = {0: -1}. Queue = [6, 1, 0]\n- Process 6: Decrease in-degree of 3. In-degrees = {3: 0}. Queue = [1, 0, 3]\n- Process 1: No neighbors. Queue = [0, 3]\n- Process 0: Decrease in-degree of 7. In-degrees = {7: 0}. Queue = [3, 7]\n- Process 3: Decrease in-degree of 1 (already 0). Queue = [7]\n- Process 7: Decrease in-degree of 5. In-degrees = {5: 0}. Queue = [5]\n- Process 5: No neighbors.\n\nWe've processed all 8 courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

We can use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. First, we identify all nodes with an in-degree of 0 (courses with no prerequisites) and add them to a queue.

Repeat until no more courses can be removed or all courses are removed.\n\n## Step 7: Execute the algorithm with the given data\nFirst, let's construct the graph and in-degrees:\n- Courses: 0 to 9\n- Prerequisites: [(8, 9), (2, 5), (5, 6), (9, 2), (3, 6), (5, 4), (0, 9), (2, 6), (7, 2), (1, 5), (7, 5), (0, 8), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 2), (1, 3), (9, 6)]\n\nLet's calculate the in-degrees and construct the adjacency list:\n- The adjacency list (prerequisites for each course) is as follows:\n- Course 0: [8, 9]\n- Course 1: [5, 3]\n- Course 2: [5, 6, 2]\n- Course 3: [6, 3, 2]\n- Course 4: [2, 3]\n- Course 5: [6, 4, 5]\n- Course 6: []\n- Course 7: [2, 5]\n- Course 8: [9]\n- Course 9: [2, 6]\n\nCorrecting the understanding of the adjacency list:\n- For each course $a$, the list contains $b$ if $(a, b)$ is a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 8: Actual calculation of in-degrees and adjacency list\nLet's correctly calculate the in-degrees and the adjacency list.\n- Adjacency list (for each course, list its prerequisites):\n- 0: [9, 8]\n- 1: [5, 3]\n- 2: [5, 6, 2, 3]\n- 3: [6, 3, 2]\n- 4: [5, 2, 3]\n- 5: [4]\n- 6: [6]\n- 7: [2, 5]\n- 8: []\n- 9: [2, 6, 9]\n\nAnd in-degrees:\n- 0: 2\n- 1: 2\n- 2: 4\n- 3: 3\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 3\n- 6: 4 (including self-loop or multiple edges)\n- 7: 0\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 3\n\n## Step 9: Simplify and directly apply Kahn's algorithm\nLet's directly apply Kahn's algorithm with the correct understanding:\n1. Initialize queue with nodes having in-degree 0.\n2. Process nodes in the queue, reducing in-degrees of their neighbors.\n\n## Step 10: Execution\nIn-degrees:\n- 0: 2\n- 1: 2\n- 2: 4\n- 3: 3\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 3\n- 6: 4\n- 7: 0 (Queue: [7])\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 3\n\nQueue: [7]\n\nProcessing:\n- Dequeue 7, decrease in-degree of 2 and 5.\n- 2: 3, 5: 2\n- Queue: still [7] is processed, now [8] can be added if its in-degree becomes 0.\n\nLet's correctly initialize and process:\n- Correct in-degrees and adjacency list:\n- 0: [8, 9], in-degree = 2\n- 1: [3, 5], in-degree = 2\n- 2: [3, 5, 9, 2], in-degree = 4 (self-loop)\n- 3: [2, 6, 1], in-degree = 3\n- 4: [2, 3, 5], in-degree = 3\n- 5: [4, 1, 7, 2], in-degree = 4\n- 6: [5, 3, 2, 9], in-degree = 4\n- 7: [], in-degree = 0 (Start with 7)\n- 8: [0], in-degree = 1\n- 9: [0, 8, 6], in-degree = 3\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the graph construction and directly check for cycles\nUpon closer inspection, we see that there's a cycle: $2 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 2$ (among others), indicating that we cannot finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The given prerequisites are: [(1, 2), (0, 1), (4, 3), (3, 2), (5, 4), (5, 3), (0, 3), (4, 1)]. We will create an adjacency list to represent this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nTo create the adjacency list, we iterate over the prerequisites. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a's prerequisites. The graph will be represented as an adjacency list where graph[i] contains all the courses that are prerequisites for course 'i'. However, for detecting cycles, it's more intuitive to directly count the in-degrees of nodes and use a queue for topological sorting.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course) and build the graph\nWe initialize a graph as an adjacency list and calculate the in-degree of each node. For each prerequisite (a, b), we increment the in-degree of 'a' and add 'b' to the adjacency list of 'a'. The graph and in-degrees will be calculated based on the given prerequisites.\n\n## Step 5: Perform topological sorting using a queue\nWe start by adding all nodes with an in-degree of 0 to a queue. Then, we iteratively remove nodes from the queue, decrease the in-degree of their neighbors, and add neighbors with an in-degree of 0 to the queue. If we can visit all nodes (i.e., all courses), then there's no cycle, and we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the topological sorting algorithm to the given problem\nFirst, let's initialize the graph and in-degrees:\n- Courses: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n- Prerequisites: [(1, 2), (0, 1), (4, 3), (3, 2), (5, 4), (5, 3), (0, 3), (4, 1)]\n\nLet's calculate in-degrees and build the graph:\n- In-degrees: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] initially\n- For (1, 2), in-degree[1] += 1, graph[2].append(1)\n- For (0, 1), in-degree[0] += 1, graph[1].append(0)\n- For (4, 3), in-degree[4] += 1, graph[3].append(4)\n- For (3, 2), in-degree[3] += 1, graph[2].append(3)\n- For (5, 4), in-degree[5] += 1, graph[4].append(5)\n- For (5, 3), in-degree[5] += 1, graph[3].append(5)\n- For (0, 3), in-degree[0] += 1, graph[3].append(0)\n- For (4, 1), in-degree[4] += 1, graph[1].append(4)\n\nAfter processing:\n- In-degrees: [2, 2, 0, 3, 2, 0]\n- Graph: {0: [], 1: [0, 4], 2: [1, 3], 3: [0, 4, 5], 4: [3], 5: [4, 3]}\n\n## Step 7: Execute the topological sorting\nQueue initially contains nodes with in-degree 0: [2, 5]\n- Dequeue 2, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (1, 3). In-degrees: [2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0]. Add 1 and 3 to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0. Since 3's in-degree is 2, only none are added now.\n- Dequeue 5, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (4, 3). In-degrees: [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Add 4 and 3 to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0. 3's in-degree is 1, so none are added now.\n- Continue this process: Dequeue 1 (in-degree of 0 after previous steps is not true, it's 1), decrease in-degree of 0. In-degrees: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0].\n- Dequeue 3 (after previous steps, its in-degree becomes 0), decrease in-degree of 0 and 4. In-degrees: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Now, 0 and 4 are added to the queue.\n- Dequeue 0, decrease in-degree of none (since it has no neighbors). \n- Dequeue 4, decrease in-degree of none.\n\n## Step 8: Check if all courses can be finished\nWe count the number of nodes visited. If it's equal to the total number of courses (6), then we can finish all courses.\n\nThe queue operations:\n1. Start with [2, 5], visited = 2\n2. Dequeue 2, visited = 3 (after visiting 1 and 3 if they were added)\n3. Dequeue 5, visited = 4 (if 3 and 4 were added)\n4.

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), indicating that course 'a' can be taken only after completing course 'b'.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' indicates that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are: [(1, 2), (0, 1), (4, 3), (3, 2), (5, 4), (5, 3), (0, 3), (4, 1)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty graph as a dictionary where each key represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of its prerequisites or an empty list if there are no prerequisites. However, for detecting cycles, it's more convenient to represent the graph where the key is the course and the value is a list of courses that depend on it. So, we adjust our approach to build the graph where each course is associated with the courses that have it as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 4: Build the graph and calculate the in-degree of each node\nWe build the graph and calculate the in-degree of each course. The in-degree of a course represents the number of prerequisites it has.\n\n- For the given prerequisites: [(1, 2), (0, 1), (4, 3), (3, 2), (5, 4), (5, 3), (0, 3), (4, 1)], we create the graph and in-degree count.\n- Graph: {0: [], 1: [0, 4], 2: [1, 3], 3: [4, 5, 0], 4: [5], 5: []} is not the correct representation. Instead, we should directly count in-degrees and build the graph as: {2: [1, 3], 1: [0, 4], 3: [4, 0, 5], 4: [5]}.\n- Correctly, the in-degrees are calculated as: in-degree[0] = 1 (because of (0,1) and (0,3)), in-degree[1] = 2 (because of (1,2) and (4,1)), in-degree[2] = 0, in-degree[3] = 3 (because of (4,3), (3,2), and (0,3) is not a prerequisite for 3 but (3,2) is), in-degree[4] = 2 (because of (5,4) and (4,3) is not but (4,1)), in-degree[5] = 2.\nLet's correct this step: The correct in-degrees are calculated based on the prerequisites: in-degree[0] = 1, in-degree[1] = 2, in-degree[2] = 1, in-degree[3] = 3, in-degree[4] = 1, in-degree[5] = 2.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting to check for cycles\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we apply topological sorting. We start with courses that have an in-degree of 0, as they have no prerequisites.\n\n## Step 6: Initialize the queue with nodes having in-degree 0\nWe identify courses with in-degree 0. From the given prerequisites, course 2 has no prerequisites directly listed for it, so in-degree[2] = 0.\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\n1. Initialize a queue with course 2 since it's the only one with in-degree 0.\n2. As we process each course in the queue, we decrease the in-degree of its neighboring courses (courses that it is a prerequisite for) by 1.\n3. If a neighboring course has its in-degree reduced to 0, it is added to the queue.\n\nLet's calculate the in-degrees properly and proceed:\n- in-degree[0] = 1 (from (0,1) and (0,3)), so it's 2.\n- in-degree[1] = 2 (from (1,2) and (4,1)).\n- in-degree[2] = 0.\n- in-degree[3] = 3 (from (3,2), (4,3), and (0,3)).\n- in-degree[4] = 2 (from (4,3) and (5,4)).\n- in-degree[5] = 2 (from (5,4) and (5,3)).\n\n## Step 8: Execute Topological Sorting\nQueue initially contains course 2.\n1. Process course 2: Decrease in-degree of 1 and 3. in-degree[1] = 1, in-degree[3] = 2. Queue = [2].\n2. Add 1 and 3 to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0. Since 1's in-degree is 1, it's not added. 3's in-degree is 2, so it's not added either.\n3. Continue this process. After processing 2, Queue = [1] because 1's in-degree becomes 0 after processing its prerequisite isn't directly done here, we need to correctly update in-degrees and queue.\n\nLet's directly apply the correct topological sorting:\n- Start with course 2 (in-degree = 0).\n- After taking 2, in-degree[1] = 1, in-degree[3] = 2. So, queue = [2].\n- Then, take 1 (after 2), in-degree[0] = 1 (because of (0,1)), in-degree[4] = 1 (because of (4,1)). So, queue = [2, 1].\n- Then, take 0 and 4. For 0, in-degree of no course is affected directly by (0,3) as 0 is the course. For 4, in-degree[5] = 1 (because of (5,4)) and in-degree[3] = 2.\n- Continuing, after 1: queue = [2, 1, 4] (since 4's in-degree becomes 0 after 1), then in-degree[3] = 2, in-degree[5] = 1.\n- After 4: queue = [2, 1, 4, 3] (since 3's in-degree becomes 1 after 4, but it's still not 0), then in-degree[5] = 0 (because of (5,3) and (5,4)), so queue = [2, 1, 4, 5, 3].\n- The correct order can be achieved by properly updating in-degrees.\n\n## Step 9: Check if all courses can be finished\nIf we can process all 6 courses, it means we can finish all courses.

The given prerequisites are: [(2, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (0, 1), (3, 1), (0, 2), (2, 4)].

Each course is a node, and a directed edge from 'b' to 'a' indicates that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are: [(2, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (0, 1), (3, 1), (0, 2), (2, 4)]. We will construct the graph based on these pairs.\n\n## Step 3: Construct the graph\nLet's construct the graph:\n- Course 0 has prerequisites: 1, 2 (from (0, 1) and (0, 2))\n- Course 1 has no prerequisites directly given, so: None (but it's a prerequisite for others)\n- Course 2 has prerequisites: 0, 4 (from (2, 0) and (2, 4))\n- Course 3 has prerequisites: 0, 1 (from (3, 0) and (3, 1))\n- Course 4 has prerequisites: 1, 2, 0 (from (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 0))\n\nCorrecting the understanding of the graph construction:\n- The graph should be represented as an adjacency list where each index represents a course, and its corresponding value is a list of courses that it is a prerequisite for.\n- The correct adjacency list based on the given prerequisites is:\n- Course 0 is a prerequisite for: 2, 3, 4, 0 (courses that have 0 as a prerequisite are 2, 3, 4)\n- Course 1 is a prerequisite for: 0, 3, 4\n- Course 2 is a prerequisite for: 0, 4\n- Course 3 has no courses that it is a prerequisite for directly listed, so we look at the pairs: it's not a prerequisite for any course directly.\n- Course 4 is a prerequisite for: 2\n\nLet's correctly represent the graph:\n- For each pair (a, b), 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a', so we add an edge from 'b' to 'a'.\n- The graph is: {0: [2, 3, 4], 1: [0, 3, 4], 2: [0, 4], 3: [], 4: [2]}\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nTo detect cycles, we calculate the in-degree of each node.\n- In-degree of 0 = 2 (since 1 and 2 are prerequisites for 0)\n- In-degree of 1 = 0\n- In-degree of 2 = 2 (since 0 and 4 are prerequisites for 2)\n- In-degree of 3 = 2 (since 0 and 1 are prerequisites for 3)\n- In-degree of 4 = 3 (since 1, 2, and 0 are prerequisites for 4)\n\nLet's correctly count the in-degrees based on the given prerequisites:\n- Course 0: has prerequisites 1, 2 (2 edges into 0)\n- Course 1: has no prerequisites listed directly (0 edges into 1)\n- Course 2: has prerequisites 0, 4 (2 edges into 2)\n- Course 3: has prerequisites 0, 1 (2 edges into 3)\n- Course 4: has prerequisites 1, 2, 0 (3 edges into 4)\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we apply topological sorting.\n1.

It's required by 1 and 2, so in-degree = 2.\n- 1 is required by 0, 3, 4, so it has edges to 0, 3, 4. It's required by none directly mentioned, so in-degree = 0 is incorrect; it should be counted based on the prerequisites given: (0, 1) means 1 is a prerequisite for 0, so 1 has an in-degree of 0, but it's actually required by 0, 3, and 4. Let's directly count: 1 is required by 0, 3, 4, so its in-degree is 3.\n- 2 is required by 0, 4, so it has edges to 0, 4. It's required by 4 and 0, so in-degree = 2.\n- 3 is required by none, so its in-degree = 2 (requires 0 and 1).\n- 4 is required by 2, so it has an edge to 2. It's required by none directly, so let's count: 4 is required by 2, so its in-degree = 3 (1, 2, 0).\n\nCorrecting the understanding:\n- The actual graph and in-degrees based on the given list:\n- (2, 0): 0 -> 2\n- (4, 1): 1 -> 4\n- (4, 2): 2 -> 4\n- (3, 0): 0 -> 3\n- (4, 0): 0 -> 4\n- (0, 1): 1 -> 0\n- (3, 1): 1 -> 3\n- (0, 2): 2 -> 0\n- (2, 4): 4 -> 2\n\nLet's correctly calculate in-degrees:\n- 0: (1, 2) -> in-degree = 2\n- 1: (0, 3, 4) -> in-degree = 3\n- 2: (0, 4) -> in-degree = 2\n- 3: (1) -> in-degree = 1\n- 4: (1, 2, 0) -> in-degree = 3, and 2 -> 4, so actually, 4 has an in-degree of 3.\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sort\nTo perform a topological sort, we start with nodes having an in-degree of 0. If there's a cycle, we won't be able to finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the Graph for Cycles\nLet's directly analyze the given prerequisites for a cycle:\n1. The prerequisites given are [(2, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (0, 1), (3, 1), (0, 2), (2, 4)].\n2. Upon closer inspection, we see a potential cycle: 0 -> 2 (because 2 requires 0), 2 -> 0 (because 0 requires 2), indicating a cycle between 0 and 2.\n3. Furthermore, examining the prerequisites closely: 0 requires 1 and 2, 1 is required by none directly but is a prerequisite for 0, 3, 4; 2 requires 0 and 4; 3 requires 0 and 1; 4 requires 1, 2, and 0. There's a cycle: 0 -> 2, 2 -> 4, 4 -> 0 (0 requires 1, 1 -> 0, 0 -> 2, 2 -> 0 directly or indirectly), and directly, 0 <-> 2 is not the only relation; 4 -> 2, 2 -> 0, 0 -> 4 is a cycle (0 -> 2, 2 -> 4, 4 -> 0).\n\n## Step 7: Check for Cycle Using In-Degree\nLet's directly check the in-degrees and perform a topological sort:\n- Correct in-degrees are:\n- 0: 2 (1, 2)\n- 1: 0\n- 2: 2 (0, 4)\n- 3: 2 (0, 1)\n- 4: 3 (1, 2, 0)\n\nStarting with in-degree 0:\n- Start with 1 (in-degree = 0), then decrease in-degrees of its neighbors (0, 3, 4).\n- After processing 1: in-degrees become 1 for 0, 1 for 3, and 2 for 4.\n- Now, 0 has in-degree 1, so we can process it, decreasing in-degrees of 2, 3, 4.\n- After 0: 2 becomes 1 (was 1 because of 4), 3 becomes 0, 4 becomes 1.\n- Process 3 (in-degree = 0), no neighbors to decrease.\n- Now, we have 2 and 4 with in-degrees 1.\n\n## Step 8: Continue Topological Sort\nContinuing:\n- Process 2 or 4 (both have in-degree 1 now, but actually, 4 has in-degree 1 after 0 and 1 are processed, and 2 has in-degree 1 after 0 is processed).\n- If we process 4, it decreases 2's in-degree to 0.\n- Then, process 2 (in-degree = 0), which decreases no one's in-degree since it has no outgoing edges to other nodes with in-degree > 0.\n\n## Step 9: Determine If All Courses Can Be Finished\nUpon detailed examination, there's a cycle: 0 -> 2, 2 -> 4, 4 -> 0. This indicates we cannot finish all courses because of the cyclic dependency.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>False</answer>",

The graph will be represented as an adjacency list where each index represents a course, and its corresponding value is a list of courses that it is a prerequisite for.\n\n## Step 3: Correctly construct the adjacency list representation of the graph\nGiven prerequisites[i] = (a_i, b_i), indicating that to take course a_i, you must first take course b_i, we construct the graph such that b_i is a prerequisite for a_i.

The in-degree of a course is the number of courses that are prerequisites for it.\n- Course 0 has in-degree 1 (required by 2) and is a prerequisite for 5 and indirectly others, directly for 2.\n- Course 1 has in-degree 1 (required by 3).\n- Course 2 has in-degree 0.\n- Course 3 has in-degree 0.\n- Course 4 has in-degree 3 (required by 1, 0, and indirectly, but directly by 1 and has a prerequisite cycle).\n- Course 5 has in-degree 1 (required by 0).\n- Course 6 has in-degree 1 (required by 4).\n- Course 7 has in-degree 0.\n\nLet's correct the understanding of in-degrees based on the given prerequisites:\n- The in-degrees are calculated based on the given pairs: [(5, 7), (0, 5), (4, 7), (1, 4), (6, 7), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 6), (0, 4)].\n- Course 7: in-degree = 3 (5, 4, 6).\n- Course 5: in-degree = 1 (0).\n- Course 4: in-degree = 2 (1, 0).\n- Course 1: in-degree = 1 (3).\n- Course 6: in-degree = 1 (4).\n- Course 0: in-degree = 2 (2, 4).\n- Course 3: in-degree = 0.\n- Course 2: in-degree = 1 (0).\n\nCorrecting the in-degrees:\n- Course 0: 2\n- Course 1: 1\n- Course 2: 1\n- Course 3: 0\n- Course 4: 2\n- Course 5: 1\n- Course 6: 1\n- Course 7: 3\n\n## Step 6: Apply Topological Sorting\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we apply topological sorting. We start with courses that have an in-degree of 0.\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\n1. Initially, courses with in-degree 0 are 3 and 7 is not (since its in-degree is 3), so we start with 3.\n2. We decrease the in-degree of course 1 (since 3 is a prerequisite for 1), so its in-degree becomes 0.\n3. Now, courses with in-degree 0 are 3, 1 (after processing 3), and potentially others as we process them.\nLet's correctly initialize and process:\n- Courses with in-degree 0: 3, 2 is not (since 0 is a prerequisite for it, and 0 has in-degree 2), so we actually start with 3.\n- After processing 3, course 1's in-degree becomes 0.\n- So, we have 3, 1 as initial courses with in-degree 0 after processing 3.\n\nLet's correctly process the graph:\n1. Start with courses having in-degree 0: {3}.\n2. Process 3, decrease in-degree of 1 to 0.\n3. Now, {3, 1} have in-degree 0. Process 1, decrease in-degree of 4.\n4. {3, 1, 4} are considered if 4's in-degree becomes 0 after processing its prerequisites. But 4 has in-degree 2, so it needs both 1 and 0 to be processed.\n5. Continuing this process: after 1 is processed, 4's in-degree is 1. After 0 is processed (which requires 5 and 2 to be processed first, and 5 requires 7), we see a dependency chain.\n\nLet's directly calculate:\n- In-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 3}.\n- Start with 3 (in-degree 0), then 1 (after 3), then potentially 4 if its prerequisites are met.\n\n## Step 8: Detailed Topological Sorting\n1. Start with 3 (in-degree = 0), decrease in-degree of 1 to 0.\n2. Now, 1 has in-degree 0. Process 1, decrease in-degree of 4 to 1.\n3. Next, process 2 (in-degree = 1 after considering its prerequisite 0 is not yet processed, but 2 is a starting point because it has no prerequisites other than 0), but actually, we should start with courses that have in-degree 0 or become 0. So, we process 2 after its prerequisite is done, but first, we need to process 0's prerequisites.\nLet's simplify:\n- The correct order to start is with in-degree 0 courses: 3.\n- After 3, we have 1.\n- The chain continues, and we need to check for cycles by verifying if all courses can be processed.\n\n## Step 9: Checking for Cycles and Completing Topological Sorting\nTo simplify, let's directly analyze the prerequisites for cycles:\n- The given prerequisites are [(5, 7), (0, 5), (4, 7), (1, 4), (6, 7), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 6), (0, 4)].\n- There's a cycle if we can find a path that starts and ends at the same node.\n\nLet's directly check for a cycle:\n- 7 -> 5 -> 0 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 is a cycle (7 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 or 7 -> 5 -> 0 -> 4 -> 7).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

Thus, the in-degrees are:\n- Course 0: 0 (initially), incremented 0 times (since it's 'a' in (0, 3) and (0, 1)), so in-degree = 0.\n- Course 1: incremented for (2, 1), (3, 1), (0, 1), so in-degree = 3.\n- Course 2: incremented for (1, 2), (4, 2), so in-degree = 2.\n- Course 3: incremented for (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), so in-degree = 3.\n- Course 4: 0 (since it's 'a' in (4, 2)), so in-degree = 0.\nCorrecting the understanding: The in-degrees should be calculated based on being the 'b' in (a, b), so:\n- Course 1 is 'b' in (2, 1), (3, 1), (0, 1), so its in-degree is 3.\n- Course 2 is 'b' in (1, 2), (4, 2), so its in-degree is 2.\n- Course 3 is 'b' in (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), so its in-degree is 3.\nThe correct in-degrees are: {0: 0, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 0}.\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\nWe start with courses having an in-degree of 0, which are 0 and 4. We process these courses, reduce the in-degree of their neighbors, and continue this process until we've processed all courses or we can't process any more.\n\n## Step 8: Execute the Topological Sorting\nInitially, courses 0 and 4 have an in-degree of 0. So, we start with them.\n- Processing course 0: It has prerequisites 3 and 1. Reducing their in-degrees: in-degree of 3 becomes 2, in-degree of 1 becomes 2.\n- Processing course 4: It has prerequisite 2. Reducing its in-degree: in-degree of 2 becomes 1.\nNow, the in-degrees are: {0: 0 (processed), 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 0 (processed)}.\nNext, we can process course 2 since its in-degree is 1. Its prerequisites are 1 and 3. Reducing their in-degrees: in-degree of 1 becomes 1, in-degree of 3 becomes 1.\nNow, the in-degrees are: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0 (processed), 3: 1, 4: 0}.\nWe can now process course 1 or 3 since their in-degrees are 1.\n- Processing course 1: Its prerequisites are 2 and 3. Reducing their in-degrees: in-degree of 2 is already 0, in-degree of 3 becomes 0.\nNow, the in-degrees are: {0: 0, 1: 0 (processed), 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0}.\n- We can then process course 3.\n\n## Step 9: Determine if all courses can be finished\nWe've processed all courses (0, 4, 2, 1, 3) in a valid order without encountering any course that has a non-zero in-degree and hasn't been processed, indicating there's no cycle that prevents us from finishing all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The prerequisites are represented as pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a graph data structure, specifically a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' represents that course 'a' requires course 'b'.\n\n## Step 3: Create the graph from the given prerequisites\nGiven prerequisites: [(2, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 3), (0, 1), (1, 3), (4, 2)]. We will create a graph where each key is a course and its corresponding value is a list of its prerequisites.\n\n## Step 4: Build the graph\nLet's build the graph:\n- Course 2 requires 1.\n- Course 0 requires 3.\n- Course 1 requires 2.\n- Course 3 requires 1.\n- Course 2 requires 3.\n- Course 0 requires 1.\n- Course 1 requires 3.\n- Course 4 requires 2.\n\nThe graph will be represented as an adjacency list where the key is the course and the value is a list of its prerequisites.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nTo detect if there's a cycle, we'll use the concept of in-degree. The in-degree of a node is the number of edges pointing to it. We calculate the in-degree for each course.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Topological Sorting\nTopological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. If there's a cycle, topological sorting is not possible.\n\n## Step 7: Implement Topological Sorting using BFS (Kahn's Algorithm)\n1. Create a graph and calculate in-degrees.\n2. Enqueue all nodes with in-degree 0.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors, and enqueue any neighbor whose in-degree becomes 0.\n4. If the number of nodes dequeued equals the total number of nodes, there's no cycle, and it's possible to finish all courses.\n\n## Step 8: Execute Kahn's Algorithm\nFirst, let's correctly represent the graph and in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [3, 1], 1: [2, 3], 2: [1, 3], 3: [1], 4: [2]}\n- In-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 1}\n\nLet's correct the understanding of the graph representation:\nThe correct representation should be based on the prerequisites given.\n\n## Step 9: Correct the graph representation and calculate in-degrees\nLet's directly calculate the in-degrees and build the graph correctly:\n- For each prerequisite (a, b), 'a' is dependent on 'b', so 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'.\n- The graph should be {course: [prerequisites]}.\n- In-degrees should count how many courses are dependent on each course.\n\n## Step 10: Actual Calculation\nLet's directly apply the steps:\n1. Initialize in-degrees = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0} and graph = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: []}.\n2.

The given prerequisites are: [(2, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 3), (0, 1), (1, 3), (4, 2)]. We will create an adjacency list to represent this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nFirst, we initialize an empty adjacency list for 5 courses: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: []}. Then, we populate it based on the given prerequisites. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a'. So, the adjacency list will be populated as follows:\n- For (2, 1), add 1 to the list of 2.\n- For (0, 3), add 3 to the list of 0.\n- For (1, 2), add 2 to the list of 1.\n- For (3, 1), add 1 to the list of 3.\n- For (2, 3), add 3 to the list of 2.\n- For (0, 1), add 1 to the list of 0.\n- For (1, 3), add 3 to the list of 1.\n- For (4, 2), add 2 to the list of 4.\nThis results in: {0: [3, 1], 1: [2, 3], 2: [1, 3], 3: [1], 4: [2]}.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node (course)\nTo detect if there's a cycle, we'll use the concept of in-degree. The in-degree of a node is the number of edges pointing to it. We calculate the in-degree for each course:\n- Course 0 has prerequisites 3 and 1, so its in-degree is 2.\n- Course 1 has prerequisites 2 and 3, so its in-degree is 2.\n- Course 2 has prerequisites 1 and 3, so its in-degree is 2.\n- Course 3 has prerequisite 1, so its in-degree is 1.\n- Course 4 has prerequisite 2, so its in-degree is 1.\nThus, the in-degrees are: {0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1}.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting using BFS\nWe start by adding all nodes with an in-degree of 0 to a queue. Since there are no courses with an in-degree of 0, the queue is initially empty. However, we can still proceed with the algorithm to check for cycles.\n- Initialize a count of visited nodes to 0.\n- For each node with in-degree 0, add it to the queue. In this case, we don't have any.\n- While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, increment the count of visited nodes, and decrease the in-degree of its neighbors. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the actual Topological Sorting\nGiven the in-degrees {0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1}, we see that course 4 has an in-degree of 1, so it's a potential starting point. However, to simplify, let's directly analyze the graph for cycles or use the in-degrees to simplify the process.\n- We notice that course 1, 2, and 3 are heavily interconnected. Let's directly check if there's a cycle by attempting to perform topological sorting or by analyzing the graph structure.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the graph for cycles\nUpon closer inspection, the prerequisites form a graph where there's a cycle involving courses 1, 2, and 3. For example, 1->2, 2->3, 3->1 is a cycle. The presence of a cycle indicates that it's impossible to finish all courses because the cycle creates a dependency loop.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the presence of a cycle and its implications\nSince there's a cycle (e.g., 1->2, 2->3, 3->1), it's not possible to finish all courses. The cycle means that to take one course, you must first take another, which in turn requires the first course, creating an impossible situation.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

The graph will be represented as an adjacency list, and we'll use a list to store the in-degrees of the nodes.\n\nGiven prerequisites: [(1, 4), (1, 0), (0, 3), (5, 3), (0, 5), (2, 1), (5, 1), (3, 2), (5, 2), (3, 4), (0, 1)]\n\nLet's initialize the graph and in-degrees:\n- Graph: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: []}\n- In-degrees: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n## Step 3: Populate the Graph and In-Degrees\nNow, we populate the graph and update the in-degrees based on the prerequisites.\n\nFor each prerequisite (a, b), we add an edge from 'b' to 'a' in the graph and increment the in-degree of 'a'.\n\n- (1, 4): Graph = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [1], 5: []}, In-degrees = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> In-degrees[1] = 1\n- (1, 0): Graph = {0: [1], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [1], 5: []}, In-degrees = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> In-degrees[1] = 2\n- (0, 3): Graph = {0: [1], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [0], 4: [1], 5: []}, In-degrees = [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> In-degrees[0] = 1\n- (5, 3): Graph = {0: [1], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [0, 5], 4: [1], 5: []}, In-degrees = [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> In-degrees[3] = 1\n- (0, 5): Graph = {0: [1], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [0, 5], 4: [1], 5: [0]}, In-degrees = [1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0] -> In-degrees[5] = 1\n- (2, 1): Graph = {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [], 3: [0, 5], 4: [1], 5: [0]}, In-degrees = [1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1] -> In-degrees[2] = 1\n- (5, 1): Graph = {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [], 3: [0, 5], 4: [1], 5: [0, 1]}, In-degrees = [1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1] -> In-degrees[1] = 3\n- (3, 2): Graph = {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [0, 5], 4: [1], 5: [0, 1]}, In-degrees = [1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1] -> In-degrees[2] = 2\n- (5, 2): Graph = {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [0, 5], 4: [1], 5: [0, 1, 2]}, In-degrees = [1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1] -> In-degrees[2] = 3\n- (3, 4): Graph = {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [0, 5], 4: [1, 3], 5: [0, 1, 2]}, In-degrees = [1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 1] -> In-degrees[3] = 2, In-degrees[1] = 4 (since 4 is now a prerequisite for 1, but we already counted 1's prerequisites)\n- (0, 1): Graph = {0: [1], 1: [2, 0], 2: [3], 3: [0, 5], 4: [1, 3], 5: [0, 1, 2]}, In-degrees = [1, 4, 3, 2, 0, 1] -> In-degrees[1] = 5 (correcting for the actual operation: we add an edge from 1 to 0, so In-degrees[0] = 2)\n\nCorrecting the above step with actual calculations:\n- Graph: {0: [1], 1: [2, 0], 2: [3], 3: [0, 5], 4: [1, 3], 5: [0, 1, 2]}\n- In-degrees: [2, 5, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n\n## Step 4: Perform Topological Sorting\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we perform a topological sort. We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n\n1. Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0. Here, it's node 4.\n2. Dequeue a node, reduce the in-degree of its neighbors by 1, and enqueue any neighbor that now has an in-degree of 0.\n3. Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty.\n\n## Step 5: Execute Topological Sorting\nStarting with node 4 (since it's the only one with in-degree 0):\n- Dequeue 4, reduce in-degree of 1 and 3. In-degrees = [2, 4, 3, 1, 0, 1]. Now, 3 has in-degree 1.\n- Enqueue 3. Queue = [3]\n- Dequeue 3, reduce in-degree of 0 and 5 (and 2, but 2's in-degree is already 3). In-degrees = [1, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0]. Now, 5 has in-degree 0.\n- Enqueue 5. Queue = [5]\n- Dequeue 5, reduce in-degree of 0, 1, and 2. In-degrees = [0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0]. Now, 0 has in-degree 0.\n- Enqueue 0. Queue = [0]\n- Dequeue 0, reduce in-degree of 1. In-degrees = [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0].\n- No new nodes are added to the queue.\n- Continue this process until the queue is empty. We cannot reduce the in-degrees of 1 and 2 to 0 because they have too many prerequisites.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the Result of Topological Sorting\nAfter performing the topological sorting, we check if all nodes have been visited (i.e., their in-degrees have been reduced to 0 at some point). If a node remains with an in-degree greater than 0, it means there's a cycle, and we cannot finish all courses.\n\nThe final count of visited nodes (or nodes with in-degree reduced to 0) is less than the total number of courses, indicating a cycle.\n\nThe answer is <answer>False</answer>.",

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), where 'a' is the course that requires 'b' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure.\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' indicates that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are: [(0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (2, 0), (4, 1)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph.\nFrom the given prerequisites, the adjacency list can be constructed as follows:\n- Course 0 is required by courses 1 and 4 and 2, so 0 has edges to 1, 4, and 2. Thus, the edges are (3, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), and (0, 2).\n- Course 3 is required by courses 0 and 1, so 3 has edges to 0 and 1. Thus, the edges are (3, 0) and (3, 1).\nThe correct representation should be:\n- Course 3 is a prerequisite for 0 and 1.\n- Course 0 is a prerequisite for 1, 4, and 2.\n- Course 1 is a prerequisite for 4.\n\n## Step 4: Correctly construct the graph.\nLet's correctly construct the graph:\n- For (0, 3), 3 -> 0\n- For (1, 3), 3 -> 1\n- For (1, 0), 0 -> 1\n- For (4, 0), 0 -> 4\n- For (2, 0), 0 -> 2\n- For (4, 1), 1 -> 4\n\nSo, the graph is:\n- 3 -> 0, 1\n- 0 -> 1, 2, 4\n- 1 -> 4\n\n## Step 5: Apply the topological sorting algorithm to check for cycles.\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we'll apply topological sorting. First, we calculate the in-degree of each node (course):\n- Course 0 has an in-degree of 1 (from 3).\n- Course 1 has an in-degree of 2 (from 3 and 0).\n- Course 2 has an in-degree of 1 (from 0).\n- Course 3 has an in-degree of 0.\n- Course 4 has an in-degree of 3 (from 0, 1).\n\n## Step 6: Perform topological sorting.\nWe start with nodes having an in-degree of 0, which is course 3. We decrease the in-degree of its neighbors (0 and 1) by 1.\n- After processing 3: in-degree of 0 = 0, in-degree of 1 = 1.\nNow, course 0 has an in-degree of 0, so we process it next, decreasing the in-degree of its neighbors (1, 2, 4).\n- After processing 0: in-degree of 1 = 0, in-degree of 2 = 0, in-degree of 4 = 2.\nNow, courses 1 and 2 have an in-degree of 0. We process them:\n- After processing 1: in-degree of 4 = 1.\n- After processing 2: no change.\n\n## Step 7: Continue topological sorting.\nWe continue with the nodes having an in-degree of 0. Now, course 4 has an in-degree of 1, so it's not processed yet. But after processing 1, its in-degree is 1. We can process it after decreasing its in-degree to 0 by processing its prerequisite (1).\n- After processing 4: no more nodes to process.\n\n## Step 8: Check if all courses can be finished.\nWe processed courses in the order: 3, 0, 1, 2, 4.

For each prerequisite (a, b), we add an edge from 'b' to 'a' in the graph and increment the in-degree of 'a'.\n\n## Step 4: Apply Topological Sorting\nTo check if we can finish all courses, we apply topological sorting.

So, for (a, b), 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a', so 'b' should point to 'a'. Thus, the correct graph is: {0: [5], 1: [7, 2, 3, 4], 2: [0, 3], 3: [5], 4: [], 5: [3, 6, 7], 6: [4], 7: [1]}.

Initially, none have in-degree 0. Let's proceed with the available data:\n- Initialize queue with courses having in-degree 0. Since there are none, we directly check the graph for cycles or proceed with the understanding that the presence of a cycle (due to non-zero in-degrees after processing) indicates it's impossible to finish all courses.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the graph for potential cycles or valid topological order\nUpon closer inspection, we see that there's a cycle (1 -> 7 -> 1), indicating that it's impossible to finish all courses due to the cyclic dependency.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

Let's correctly represent the graph based on the given prerequisites:\n- For (1, 7), 7 -> 1\n- For (7, 4), 4 -> 7\n- For (2, 1), 1 -> 2\n- For (6, 2), 2 -> 6\n- For (0, 2), 2 -> 0\n- For (2, 4), 4 -> 2\n- For (5, 2), 2 -> 5\n- For (3, 4), 4 -> 3\nSo, the graph is: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [0, 5, 6], 3: [], 4: [2, 3, 7], 5: [], 6: [], 7: []} is still not correctly represented. The correct adjacency list should directly reflect the prerequisites:\n- 1 has prerequisite 7\n- 7 has prerequisite 4\n- 2 has prerequisite 1\n- 6 has prerequisite 2\n- 0 has prerequisite 2\n- 2 has prerequisite 4\n- 5 has prerequisite 2\n- 3 has prerequisite 4\nThus, the in-degree of each node (course) and the graph should be correctly calculated.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node and create the graph\nLet's correctly calculate the in-degree and create the graph.\n- The graph based on prerequisites is represented as an adjacency list where each key is a course and its value is a list of courses that it is a prerequisite for.\n- In-degree is the number of prerequisites a course has.\nFor the given list: [(1, 7), (7, 4), (2, 1), (6, 2), (0, 2), (2, 4), (5, 2), (3, 4)], we have:\n- Course 1 has prerequisite 7 (in-degree = 1)\n- Course 7 has prerequisite 4 (in-degree = 1)\n- Course 2 has prerequisite 1 (in-degree = 1)\n- Course 6 has prerequisite 2 (in-degree = 1)\n- Course 0 has prerequisite 2 (in-degree = 1)\n- Course 2 has prerequisite 4 (in-degree = 1)\n- Course 5 has prerequisite 2 (in-degree = 1)\n- Course 3 has prerequisite 4 (in-degree = 1)\nSo, the in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1}.\nAnd the graph (adjacency list) is:\n{0: [], 1: [2], 2: [0, 5, 6], 3: [], 4: [2, 3, 7], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [1]}.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting to check if all courses can be finished\nTo check if all courses can be finished, we apply topological sorting. We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0, which are the courses with no prerequisites.\n\n## Step 6: Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0\nFrom Step 4, the in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1}. So, course 4 has an in-degree of 0. We initialize the queue with [4].\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\n1. Queue = [4], visited = 0.\n2. Dequeue 4, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (2, 3, 7). Now, in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 0, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 0}. Queue = [4, 3, 7].\n3. Dequeue 3, no neighbors. Queue = [7], visited = 2.\n4. Dequeue 7, decrease in-degree of 1. Now, in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 2, 5: 1, 6: 1}. Queue = [1], visited = 3.\n5. Dequeue 1, decrease in-degree of 2. Now, in-degrees are: {0: 1, 2: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1}. Queue = [2], visited = 4.\n6. Dequeue 2, decrease in-degree of 0, 5, 6. Now, in-degrees are: {0: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0}. Queue = [0, 5, 6], visited = 5.\n7. Dequeue 0, 5, 6, no neighbors to decrease in-degree for. visited = 8.\n\n## Step 8: Check if all nodes have been visited\nWe visited 8 nodes, which means we can finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>True</answer>",

The prerequisites are given as pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' indicates that course 'a' requires course 'b'. The given prerequisites are: [(1, 7), (7, 4), (2, 1), (6, 2), (0, 2), (2, 4), (5, 2), (3, 4)]. We will create an adjacency list to represent this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nTo create the adjacency list, we iterate over the prerequisites. For each pair (a, b), we add 'b' to the list of 'a's prerequisites. So, the graph will be represented as an adjacency list where each index represents a course, and its corresponding value is a list of courses that are prerequisites for it.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and calculate in-degrees\nWe initialize the graph as follows:\n- Course 0: [2]\n- Course 1: [7]\n- Course 2: [1, 6, 0, 5]\n- Course 3: [4]\n- Course 4: [7, 2]\n- Course 5: []\n- Course 6: []\n- Course 7: [4]\n\nAnd calculate the in-degree of each node (course):\n- In-degree of 0: 1\n- In-degree of 1: 1\n- In-degree of 2: 4\n- In-degree of 3: 1\n- In-degree of 4: 3\n- In-degree of 5: 1\n- In-degree of 6: 1\n- In-degree of 7: 1\n\n## Step 5: Apply Topological Sorting\nTopological sorting is used to order the courses such that for every edge (a, b), course 'b' comes before 'a'. If there's a cycle, we can't topologically sort the graph, meaning we can't finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the Topological Sorting algorithm\n1. Start with nodes having in-degree 0. Initially, these are courses with no prerequisites.\n2. Decrease the in-degree of neighboring nodes by 1 for each node we visit.\n3. If a node's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n\nLet's correct and simplify the steps for topological sorting:\n- The graph is: {0: [2], 1: [7], 2: [1, 6, 0, 5], 3: [4], 4: [7, 2], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [4]} is incorrect based on the given prerequisites. The correct representation should directly reflect the prerequisites: (1, 7), (7, 4), (2, 1), (6, 2), (0, 2), (2, 4), (5, 2), (3, 4).\n- Correct graph representation based on prerequisites: The course that is a prerequisite for another is the one that should be pointed to. So, for (a, b), 'a' is dependent on 'b', hence 'b' -> 'a'.\n- Correct in-degrees and graph:\n- Graph: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [0, 5, 6], 3: [], 4: [2, 3, 7], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [1]}\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1}\n\n## Step 7: Execute Topological Sorting\n1. Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0.\n2. For the given graph and in-degrees:\n- Courses with in-degree 0 are: 5, 6, 3 (since they have no prerequisites listed).\n\n## Step 8: Perform the actual Topological Sorting\nQueue = [5, 6, 3] because they have in-degree 0.\n1. Dequeue 5, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (2). In-degree of 2 becomes 2.\n2. Dequeue 6, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (2). In-degree of 2 becomes 1.\n3. Dequeue 3, decrease in-degree of its neighbors (4). In-degree of 4 becomes 2.\n4. Now, Queue = [0] (since its in-degree is 1 and becomes 0 after 2 is processed, but 2 is not yet processed), actually, we should continue with the current queue.\n5. Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n\nLet's directly analyze the graph for cycles or use the in-degree and graph to directly assess feasibility.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the Topological Sorting Process\nLet's directly count and process:\n- Initial in-degrees: 0:1, 1:1, 2:3, 3:1, 4:3, 5:0, 6:0, 7:1\n- Queue initially: [5, 6]\n\n## Step 10: Detailed Topological Sorting\n1. Process 5: Decrease in-degree of 2. (2:2)\n2. Process 6: Decrease in-degree of 2. (2:1)\n3. Now, Queue = [5, 6, 3] (after processing 5 and 6, and initially 3 is also 0 or becomes relevant)\n4. Process 3: Decrease in-degree of 4. (4:2)\n5. Queue = [0] is not directly added, but after processing 2 (which becomes 0 after 1 is processed), 0 can be processed.\n- Actual sequence and checking for cycles or completion.\n\nThe final step involves checking if all nodes can be visited. If the count of visited nodes equals the total number of nodes (8 courses), then it's possible to finish all courses.\n\nThe answer is <answer>False</answer>.",

The prerequisites are given as a list of pairs (a, b), where 'a' is the course that requires 'b' as a prerequisite.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites in a suitable data structure\nTo solve this problem, we can represent the courses and their prerequisites using a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' indicates that 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'. The given prerequisites are: [(1, 7), (7, 4), (2, 1), (6, 2), (0, 2), (2, 4), (5, 2), (3, 4)]. We will create an adjacency list representation of this graph.\n\n## Step 3: Create the adjacency list representation of the graph\nTo create the adjacency list, we iterate over the prerequisites. For each pair (a, b), we add 'a' to the list of nodes that 'b' points to. Initially, we have an empty graph: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [], 7: []}. After adding the edges based on the prerequisites, the graph becomes:\n- For (1, 7), we add 1 to the list of 7: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [1]}\n- For (7, 4), we add 7 to the list of 4: {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [7], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [1]}\n- For (2, 1), we add 2 to the list of 1: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [7], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [1]}\n- For (6, 2), we add 6 to the list of 2: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [6], 3: [], 4: [7], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [1]}\n- For (0, 2), we add 0 to the list of 2: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [0, 6], 3: [], 4: [7], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [1]}\n- For (2, 4), we add 2 to the list of 4: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [0, 6], 3: [], 4: [7, 2], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [1]}\n- For (5, 2), we add 5 to the list of 2: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [0, 5, 6], 3: [], 4: [7, 2], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [1]}\n- For (3, 4), we add 3 to the list of 4: {0: [], 1: [2], 2: [0, 5, 6], 3: [], 4: [7, 2, 3], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [1]}\nThe correct representation should actually be the inverse for our purpose (i.e., 'b' is a prerequisite for 'a'), so we directly build it as: {0: [2], 1: [2, 7], 2: [0, 5, 6], 3: [4], 4: [2, 3, 7], 5: [2], 6: [2], 7: [1, 4]}.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the in-degree of each node\nTo detect cycles, we calculate the in-degree of each node. The in-degree is the number of edges pointing to a node. For the given graph {0: [2], 1: [2, 7], 2: [0, 5, 6], 3: [4], 4: [2, 3, 7], 5: [2], 6: [2], 7: [1, 4]}, we count the occurrences of each node as a prerequisite:\n- 0 is pointed to by 2, so in-degree(0) = 1\n- 1 is pointed to by 2 and 7, so in-degree(1) = 2\n- 2 is pointed to by 0, 5, and 6, so in-degree(2) = 3\n- 3 is pointed to by 4, so in-degree(3) = 1\n- 4 is pointed to by 2, 3, and 7, so in-degree(4) = 3\n- 5 is pointed to by 2, so in-degree(5) = 1\n- 6 is pointed to by 2, so in-degree(6) = 1\n- 7 is pointed to by 1 and 4, so in-degree(7) = 2\nSo, the in-degrees are: {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 2}.\n\n## Step 5: Perform Topological Sorting using Kahn's Algorithm\nWe start with nodes having an in-degree of 0. Initially, there are no nodes with in-degree 0. We will use a queue to store nodes with in-degree 0 and iteratively decrease the in-degree of neighboring nodes.\n\n## Step 6: Initialize the queue with nodes having in-degree 0\nSince there are no nodes with in-degree 0, we directly proceed to check for cycles.\n\n## Step 7: Check for cycles by attempting to perform topological sorting\nGiven that we have in-degrees for all nodes, we can see that there are no nodes with 0 in-degree initially. Let's directly analyze the graph for cycles or use the in-degrees to simplify the process.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the analysis by directly checking for cycles or using the given in-degrees\nUpon closer inspection, we can simplify the steps: We need to check if there's a cycle. If there's a cycle, we cannot finish all courses. Let's directly apply Kahn's algorithm or detect cycles.\n\n## Step 9: Apply Kahn's Algorithm\n1. Initialize a queue with all nodes having an in-degree of 0.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, decrease the in-degree of its neighbors, and enqueue any neighbor whose in-degree becomes 0.\nSince initially, there's no node with in-degree 0, let's directly check the feasibility.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the graph for a cycle\nLet's directly construct the graph and check: The graph is {0: [2], 1: [2, 7], 2: [0, 5, 6], 3: [4], 4: [2, 3, 7], 5: [2], 6: [2], 7: [1, 4]}. To simplify, let's analyze the prerequisites directly for a potential cycle.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the problem by directly analyzing the prerequisites for cycles\nLooking at the prerequisites:\n- 1 requires 7\n- 7 requires 4\n- 2 requires 1\n- 6 requires 2\n- 0 requires 2\n- 2 requires 4\n- 5 requires 2\n- 3 requires 4\nWe can see that 2 and 4 are involved in a potential cycle because 2 requires 4 and 4 requires 2 (through other nodes or directly). Let's directly check the cycle.\n\n## Step 12: Check for the presence of a cycle\nUpon examining the prerequisites closely:\n- 4 -> 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 is a cycle (4 requires 2, 2 requires 1, 1 requires 7, 7 requires 4).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>False</answer>",

If the number of visited nodes equals the total number of nodes (9 courses), then it's possible to finish all courses.\n\n## Step 8: Execute Topological Sorting with the given data\n- Initial in-degrees: {0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 0, 3: 3, 4: 5, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 2, 8: 1}.\n- Queue initially contains {2}.\n- Visiting '2', we decrease in-degrees of '5' and '6'. So, '5' and '6' become {5: 0, 6: 0}.\n- Now, queue = {5, 6}. Visiting '5' and '6', we decrease in-degrees of their neighbors. '5' is a prerequisite for '1' and '2' (already visited), '4'; '6' is a prerequisite for '2' (already visited) and '3'. So, '1': 1, '4': 4, '3': 2.\n- Queue now = {1}. Visiting '1', we decrease '4': 3.\n- Continuing this process: Queue = {1}, then '1' is visited, '4': 2. Then, queue might include nodes like '8', '0' if their in-degrees become 0.\n- Let's correctly track: After '2', we have '5' and '6' in the queue. After visiting '5' and '6', '1', '3', '8', '0' might be considered based on their in-degrees.\n- The correct sequence and in-degree updates need to be tracked precisely.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed Topological Sorting\n1. Start with '2' (in-degree 0). Decrease in-degrees of '5' and '6'. Now, '5' and '6' have in-degree 0.\n2. Visit '5' and '6'. '5' decreases in-degree of '1' and '4'. '6' decreases in-degree of '3'.\n3. '1' has in-degree 1, '4' has in-degree 4, '3' has in-degree 2.\n4. Continue the process: After '5' and '6', we have '1' and potentially others if their in-degrees drop to 0.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the Topological Sorting Process\nLet's simplify by directly checking the feasibility:\n- The graph is: {0: [4, 7], 1: [4, 5], 2: [5, 6], 3: [4, 7, 8], 4: [], 5: [4], 6: [3, 4], 7: [4], 8: [0, 3]}.\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 5, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1}.\n\n## Step 11: Finalize Topological Sorting\nUpon careful examination, we see that '4' has an in-degree of 5, indicating it's a bottleneck.

The prerequisites are given as pairs (a, b), meaning course 'a' requires course 'b' to be taken first.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the prerequisites as a graph\nTo solve this, we need to represent the given prerequisites as a directed graph, where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node 'b' to node 'a' indicates that course 'a' requires course 'b'. The given prerequisites are: [(8, 0), (3, 4), (1, 4), (2, 5), (0, 4), (6, 4), (2, 6), (0, 7), (8, 3), (5, 4), (3, 7), (7, 4), (1, 5), (6, 3)].\n\n## Step 3: Build the graph and calculate in-degrees\nFirst, we build the graph and calculate the in-degree of each node. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, and in-degrees are stored in a separate list. For each prerequisite (a, b), we add an edge from 'b' to 'a' in the graph and increment the in-degree of 'a'.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and in-degrees\nLet's initialize the graph and in-degrees based on the given prerequisites.\n- Graph: {0: [8], 1: [3, 4, 5], 2: [5, 6], 3: [7, 8], 4: [0, 1, 5, 6, 7], 5: [2, 4], 6: [2, 3, 4], 7: [0, 3, 4], 8: [3]}\n- Correcting the understanding: The actual graph should be constructed by iterating through the prerequisites: For (8, 0), (3, 4), (1, 4), (2, 5), (0, 4), (6, 4), (2, 6), (0, 7), (8, 3), (5, 4), (3, 7), (7, 4), (1, 5), (6, 3), we get the adjacency list and in-degrees.\n\n## Step 5: Correctly build the adjacency list and in-degrees\nLet's correctly build the adjacency list and calculate in-degrees:\n- For each (a, b), add 'b' to the list of 'a's prerequisites in the graph, so the graph is {a: [..., b, ...]}. Thus, the correct graph is constructed by reversing the pairs: {8: [0], 3: [4, 8], 1: [4], 2: [5, 6], 0: [4, 7], 6: [4, 3], 5: [4], 7: [4, 3]}.\n- In-degrees: {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 3, 4: 5, 5: 1, 6: 2, 7: 2, 8: 1}.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Topological Sorting\nTo check if all courses can be finished, we apply topological sorting. We start with nodes having an in-degree of 0, and gradually decrease the in-degree of their neighbors as we \"visit\" them.\n\n## Step 7: Perform Topological Sorting\n1. Initialize a queue with nodes having in-degree 0. From step 5, nodes with in-degree 0 are {2}.\n2. Dequeue a node, and for each of its neighbors, decrease their in-degree by 1. If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n3. Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty.\n4.

So, '5' and '6' become {5: 0, 6: 0}.\n- Now, queue = {5, 6}. Visiting '5' and '6', we decrease in-degrees of their neighbors. '5' is a prerequisite for '1' and '2' (already visited), '4'; '6' is a prerequisite for '2' (already visited) and '3'. So, '1': 1, '4': 4, '3': 2.\n- Queue now = {1}. Visiting '1', we decrease '4': 3.\n- Continuing this process: Queue = {1}, then '1' is visited, '4': 2. Then, queue might include nodes like '8', '0' if their in-degrees become 0.\n- Let's correctly track: After '2', we have '5' and '6' in the queue. After visiting '5' and '6', '1', '3', '8', '0' might be considered based on their in-degrees.\n- The correct sequence and in-degree updates need to be tracked precisely.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed Topological Sorting\n1. Start with '2' (in-degree 0). Decrease in-degrees of '5' and '6'. Now, '5' and '6' have in-degree 0.\n2. Visit '5' and '6'. '5' decreases in-degree of '1' and '4'. '6' decreases in-degree of '3'.\n3. '1' has in-degree 1, '4' has in-degree 4, '3' has in-degree 2.\n4.

This is a classic problem of detecting a cycle in a directed graph, where courses are nodes, and prerequisites are directed edges.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the given prerequisites as a graph\nTo solve this, we first need to represent the given prerequisites as a directed graph.

The graph will be represented as an adjacency list where each index represents a course and its corresponding value is a list of courses that it is dependent on.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize the graph and in-degree array\nWe initialize a graph as an adjacency list and an in-degree array.
