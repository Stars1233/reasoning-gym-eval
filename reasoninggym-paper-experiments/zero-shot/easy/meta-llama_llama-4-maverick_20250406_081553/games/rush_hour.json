The red car (AA) is oriented horizontally and is on the third row. It is currently blocked by 'J' on its right.\n2. 'J' is also oriented horizontally and is blocking 'AA'.

So, 'J' needs to be moved down to clear the path.\n   - 'J' is currently at the third row, third column, and is oriented vertically. It can be moved up or down.\n   - To move 'J', we first need to check if there's any obstruction. 'I' is above 'J', and it's also oriented vertically. So, 'I' needs to be moved up to allow 'J' to move down.\n   - Let's start by moving 'I' up.\n\n4. **Moves:**\n   - 'I' is in the second column and spans across the first and second rows. To move it up, we need to check if there's space. There's a wall ('x') at the top, so 'I' can't move up further than it already is. However, we can still try to maneuver around it.\n   - Let's analyze 'I' and 'J': Since 'I' is stuck due to the wall, let's directly focus on 'C' and 'J'. 'C' is to the right of 'J' and is horizontal. If 'C' moves left, it will clear 'J's right path, but 'J' still can't move down because 'D' is below it and 'D' is also oriented vertically.\n   - Let's directly plan the moves:\n     1.

'J' is vertical, so it can move up or down.\n   - 'J' is currently at `G.IJCC` and `HAAJ.K`, so it can move down to `HAAJ.K` and then further down. However, it is blocked by 'C' on the top and 'D' and 'K' on the bottom is not a concern for 'J', but 'C' is. 'C' needs to be moved first.\n\nLet's start solving:\n- Move 'C' right: `C+2` because it is horizontally oriented and needs to be moved out of 'J's way. The new position for 'C' would be beyond 'K', which is feasible as there are no walls blocking its path on the right.\n- Then, move 'J' down: `J+1` (down), because it is vertically oriented.\n\nNow, let's detail the steps:\n1. `C+2` to move 'C' out of the way.\n2. `J+1` to move 'J' down, freeing 'AA'.\n3. `A+2` to move 'AA' to the exit.\n\nOther cars may need to be moved to allow these movements. Let's analyze further:\n- 'C' is at `G.IJCC`, so `C+2`.\n- Before moving 'C', 'I' needs to be moved out of the way because 'C' is blocked by 'I' indirectly due to being in the same row and 'I' being in the way of 'B' or other potential moves, but directly 'C' can move if 'I' and 'B' are managed.\n- 'I' is vertical, so it can move up or down. Let's move it up: `I-2` (since it's at the second row, it can move up to the first row).\n\nLet's re-evaluate and directly specify the moves needed based on the initial analysis and adjust as necessary.\n\n1. Move 'I' up to free 'C': `I-2`.\n2. Move 'B' right (if necessary) or manage 'C': Since 'B' is blocked by 'x', we directly manage 'C'. So, `C+2`.\n3. Move 'J' down: `J+1`.\n4. Move 'A' right: `A+2`.\n\nLet's directly calculate the required moves with the correct sequence:\n1. `I-2` to clear the upper path.\n2. `C+2` to move 'C' out of the way.\n3. `J+1` to move 'J' down.\n4. `A+2` to move 'AA' to the exit.\n\nThe final sequence is: `I-2 C+2 J+1 A+2`.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>I-2 C+2 J+1 A+2</answer>",

'AA' is currently positioned horizontally in the third row, blocked by 'K' on the right and 'G' on the left.\n\n1. The first step is to analyze the position of 'AA' and the surrounding vehicles.\n- 'AA' is in the third row, and its rightmost end is in the fourth column.\n- 'K' is to the right of 'AA', and 'G' is to the left.\n\n2. To move 'AA' to the right, we need to clear the path by moving 'K'.\n\nLet's start by examining the possible moves:\n- 'K' is blocking 'AA'. 'K' is oriented vertically, so it can move up or down. We need to move it out of the way.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. Move 'K' down to clear the path for 'AA'. To do this, 'K' needs to move down. Currently, 'K' is in the second and third rows. It can move down to the fourth and fifth rows. So, 'K+1' is a valid move if there's space.\n\nLet's check the fourth row for 'K'. It's in the fourth column, and there's 'C' in the fourth row, fifth column, but 'C' is part of 'CC' which is horizontal and can potentially be moved left.\n\n2. Before moving 'K', let's check if 'C' can be moved to give 'K' space to move down.\n- 'CC' is in the fourth row and is horizontal, so it can be moved left or right. It can be moved left to clear the path for 'K' to move down.\n\nLet's start making moves:\n- Move 'C' left: 'C-2' (since it's a 2-space car and we need to clear the fourth column for 'K').\n\nAfter 'C-2', the board changes, and 'K' can potentially move down.\n\nLet's continue this process step by step, analyzing the board and the moves required.\n\nThe initial moves to consider are:\n1. 'C-2' to clear the path for 'K'.\n2. Then, 'K+1' to move 'K' down.\n\nAfter 'C-2', the situation for 'K' improves as 'K' can now move down.\n\nLet's directly formulate the sequence of moves required to free 'AA' and move it out.\n\n1. 'C-2' (Move 'CC' left by 2 spaces)\n2. 'K+1' (Move 'K' down by 1 space)\n3.

It needs to move to the right to exit.\n   - The car is blocked by `J` and `K` and possibly other cars that need to be moved out of the way.\n   - `J` is a vertical car that can move up or down. `K` is also a vertical car and can move up or down.\n   - To move `AA` to the right, we need to clear the path by moving `J` and `K`.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n   - First, let's move `J` down to clear the path for `AA`. `J` is currently at the second and third rows. Moving it down means `J+1`.\n   - To move `J` down, we check its current position and see it's blocked by `I` on top. `I` is a horizontal car, so it can move left or right. We need to move `I` left to free `J`. `I` is at the first row, so `I-3` will move it out of the way.\n   - After moving `I`, we can move `J` down: `J+1`.\n   - Then, we need to deal with `K`. `K` is also vertical and can be moved up or down. To clear the path for `AA`, we should move `K` down as well: `K+1` (since it's below `AA`, moving down will clear the path for `AA` to potentially move further if needed, but actually, we just need to move `AA` right).\n   - Now, let's directly move `AA` to the right. `AA` can be moved right since the path is cleared by adjusting `J` and `K`. So, `AA+1` (or simply `A+1` as per the notation for moving cars).\n\nLet's implement these steps with the correct notation:\n1. Move `I` left: `I-3`\n2. Move `J` down: `J+1`\n3. Move `K` down: `K+1`\n4. Move `AA` right: `A+1`\n\nSo, the moves are: `I-3 J+1 K+1 A+1`\n\nLet's verify if this sequence is correct and sufficient.\n\nAfter `I-3`, the board becomes:\n   ```\n   ....x\n   G.JCC\n   GAAJK.\n   G.DDKL\n   H.xEEL\n   HFFF..\n   ```\n`J+1`:\n   ```\n   ....\n   G..CC\n   GAAJK.\n   G.JDKL\n   H.xEEL\n   HFFF..\n   ```\n`K+1`:\n   ```\n   ....\n   G..CC\n   GAAJ..\n   G.JDKL\n   H.xEEL\n   HKFF..\n   HFFF..\n   ```\n`A+1` (or `AA+1`):\n   ```\n   ....\n   G..CC\n   GAAA..\n   G.JDKL\n   H.xEEL\n   HKFF..\n   HFFF..\n   ```\n\nThe final move to exit `AA` is achieved.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>I-3 J+1 K+1 A+1</answer> \nHowever, to exactly follow the example output format which expects a specific sequence of moves directly related to the vehicles' identifiers as given:\n<answer>I-3 J+1 K+1 A+1</answer> should be directly provided as is, without any further breakdown.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>I-3 J+1 K+1 A+1</answer>",

To move it to the right, we need to clear the path.\n\n3. **Analyze 'AA' Surroundings**: 'AA' is in the third row, and its rightmost end is under 'C' and 'L'. To move 'AA' to the right, 'L' needs to be moved first.\n\n4. **Plan the Moves**:\n   - 'L' is vertically oriented. To clear the path for 'AA', we need to move 'L' up or down. 'L' is between 'J' and '.' (empty space) or 'x' (wall), so it can move up.\n   - Move 'L' up: Since 'L' is in the second and third row, we can move it up by one space. So, 'L+1'.\n\n5. **Detailed Step-by-Step Moves**:\n   - Initially, the board is:\n     ```\n     BBJCC.\n     DDJ.L.\n     HIAAL.\n     HIEELx\n     H..KFF\n     GG.K..\n     ```\n   - 'L' is in the way.

'J' is above 'L', so we need to move 'J' first.\n   - 'J' is horizontally oriented. It's part of 'BJCC' or 'DJ.', so we need to move 'J' (and 'B' or 'D') left or right.\n   - 'B' and 'D' are vertically oriented, so they can't move left or right. 'C' is horizontally oriented and can move.\n   - Move 'C' right: `C+1`. This will allow 'J' to move.\n   - 'J' can now potentially move left since 'C' has moved right.\n\n7. **Actual Moves**:\n   - `C+1` to make space for 'J'.\n   - `J-2` to move 'J' left.\n   - `L+1` to move 'L' up.\n   - `A+2` to move 'AA' to the exit.\n\nLet's translate the plan into the required format:\n- `C+1` (Move 'C' one space to the right)\n- `J-2` (Move 'J' two spaces to the left)\n- `L+1` (Move 'L' one space up)\n- `A+2` (Move 'A' two spaces to the right)\n\nThe sequence is: `C+1 J-2 L+1 A+2`\n\nLet's check if 'B', 'D', 'H', 'I', 'E', 'K', 'F', 'G' need to be moved. 'B', 'D', 'H', 'I', 'E', 'K', 'F', 'G' might need to be moved to facilitate the movement of 'J', 'L', and 'A'.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n- To move 'J', we need to move 'C'. So, `C+1`.\n- Then, `J-2`.\n- 'L' can move up after 'J' is moved, so `L+1`.\n- 'A' can then move right, so `A+2`.\n\nThe final sequence considering the given constraints and upon detailed examination is indeed focused on clearing the path for 'AA'.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>C+1 J-2 L+1 A+2</answer>",

The given board is:\n```\nBBJCC.\nDDJ.L.\nHIAAL.\nHIEELx\nH..KFF\nGG.K..\n```\n\n2. First, we identify the positions and orientations of the cars and the wall.\n- AA is horizontal and at the third row.\n- The wall is at the fourth row, last column.\n\n3. To move AA to the right, we need to clear the path by moving other cars.\n\nLet's start analyzing and moving the cars step by step.\n\n1. The car 'L' is blocking 'AA'. 'L' is vertical, so it can move up or down. We need to move it up to free 'AA'.\n\nInitial 'L' position is at (4,3). To move it up, we need to check if there's a car blocking it. 'J' and 'I' and 'E' are around it, but 'E' is horizontal and cannot move up/down. 'I' is vertical and is blocking 'L'. 'I' is also blocking 'E', and 'E' is blocked by 'x' on its right.\n\nLet's start by moving 'I'. 'I' is at (3,2) and (4,2). It can move up or down. To free 'L', we need to move 'I' down.\n\n'I' is blocked by 'H', which is vertical. So, we need to move 'H' first.\n\n'H' is at (3,0) and (4,0) and (5,0). It can move up or down. Let's move 'H' down.\n\n'H-3' is not possible because it will go out of the grid, but 'H+3' is possible as it will move down.\n\n4. Let's start with 'H+3'.\n\nAfter 'H+3', 'H' will be at (6,0), (7,0), and it is out of the grid, so we actually move it down by 1: 'H+1'.\n\nBoard after 'H+1':\n```\nBBJCC.\nDDJ.L.\nHIAAL.\nHIEELx\nH..KFF\nGG.K..\n```\nbecomes\n```\nBBJCC.\nDDJ.L.\nIIAAL.\nHIEELx\nHIEKFF\nGG.K..\n```\n\nNow, 'I+1' or 'I-2' are the possible moves for 'I'. Let's do 'I+1'.\n\nAfter 'I+1', the board becomes:\n```\nBBJCC.\nDDJ.L.\nIIAAL.\nIIEELx\nHEKFF\nGG.K..\n```\n\nNow 'L' can move up: 'L-1'.\n\nAfter 'L-1', the board becomes:\n```\nBBJCC.\nDDJLL.\nIIAAL.\nIIEELx\nHEKFF\nGG.K..\n```\n\nNow 'A' can move right. 'A+1' is the move.\n\nAfter 'A+1', the board becomes:\n```\nBBJCC.\nDDJLL.\nIIAAA.\nIIEELx\nHEKFF\nGG.K..\n```\n\n'A+1' again.\n\nAfter 'A+1', the board becomes:\n```\nBBJCC.\nDDJLL.\nIIAAA.\nIIEELx\nHEKFF\nGG.K..\n```\n\n'A+1' is not possible because 'A' is blocked by 'L' and then 'x'. We need to move 'L' again.\n\nLet's analyze: 'L' is at (2,3) and (2,4). It can move up or down. Let's move 'L' down: 'L+2'.\n\nAfter 'L+2', the board becomes:\n```\nBBJCC.\nDDJ..\nIIAAL.\nIIEELx\nHELFF\nGGLK..\n```\n\nNow 'A+1'.\n\nAfter 'A+1', the board becomes:\n```\nBBJCC.\nDDJ..\nIIAAA.\nIIEELx\nHELFF\nGGLK..\n```\n\n'A' is now at the exit.\n\nLet's summarize the moves:\n1. 'H+1'\n2. 'I+1'\n3. 'L-1'\n4. 'A+1'\n5. 'L+2'\n6. 'A+1'\n\nThe sequence is 'H+1 I+1 L-1 A+1 L+2 A+1'.\n\n<answer>H+1 I+1 L-1 A+1 L+2 A+1</answer>",

The red car 'AA' is oriented horizontally and is to be moved to the exit on the right.\n\n1. **Identify 'AA' and its position**: 'AA' is on the third row, and its position is between 'I' and 'L'.

'J+2' to move 'J' up.\n2. 'L+2' to move 'L' right.\n3. 'A+2' to move 'AA' to the exit.\n\nSo, the moves are 'J+2 L+2 A+2'.\n\n<answer>J+2 L+2 A+2</answer>",

To move 'AA' to the right, we first need to clear the path by moving 'J' and 'K'.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Movement:**\n   - Let's start by analyzing the vehicles blocking 'AA' and other relevant vehicles.\n   - 'J' is a vertical car. To move 'J', we need to move it up or down. \n   - 'K' is also a vertical car and is blocked by 'x' in the fourth row. We need to move 'K' up.\n\n5. **Detailed Steps:**\n   1. Move 'K' up. 'K' is in the third, fourth, and fifth rows. To move it up, we first need to analyze its current state. 'K+3' is not possible directly because 'K' is blocked by 'x' in the fourth row. We need to free 'K'.\n   2. 'J' is blocking 'AA'. 'J' is a vertical car, so we can move it up or down. 'J-1' is possible as there's no blockage above it.\n   3. After 'J-1', 'AA' can potentially move. Let's examine: after 'J-1', 'AA+1' is possible.\n\nLet's detail the steps with the required format in mind ('F+1 K+1 M-1 C+3 H+2 ...').\n\n1. **Initial Moves:**\n   - 'J' is on the second and third rows. We can move 'J' up by 'J-1'.\n   - So, the first move is 'J-1'.\n\n2. **After 'J-1':**\n   - The board changes, and 'AA' can now move right.

The first step is to analyze the position of the red car (AA) and its possible moves. The red car is horizontally oriented and is blocked by the wall on its left, so it can only move to the right.\n\n2. To move AA to the right, we need to clear the path by moving other cars. The car is currently at `xAAI.L`, so it needs to move 3 spaces to the right to exit.\n\n3.

'L' can move right.\n\nLet's continue with the moves:\n- `L+1` to move 'L' to the right.\n\nAfter analyzing the board and the cars' movements, here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. `I+1` to move 'I' down.\n2. `L+1` to move 'L' to the right, freeing the path for AA.\n3. `AA+3` to move AA to the exit.\n\nOther cars need to be moved to enable these moves.\n\nLet's break it down further:\n- `F-2` to move 'F' up and free 'B' and 'J' and 'K'.\n- `J-2` to move 'J' left.\n- `K-2` to move 'K' left.\n- `B-2` to move 'B' left.\n- `I+1` to move 'I' down as mentioned.\n- `L+1` to move 'L' right.\n- `AA+3` to move AA right.\n\nOther necessary moves to free the cars:\n- `C-1` to move 'C' left, enabling 'H' to move.\n- `H+1` to move 'H' right.\n- `G+1` to move 'G' right.\n\nLet's put it all together in a valid sequence:\n1. `F-2` \n2. `J-2`\n3. `K-2`\n4. `B-2`\n5. `C-1`\n6. `H+1`\n7. `I+1`\n8. `G+1`\n9. `L+1`\n10. `D+1` (To adjust 'D' since 'G' moved right)\n11. `AA+3`\n\nSo, the moves are: `F-2 J-2 K-2 B-2 C-1 H+1 I+1 G+1 L+1 D+1 AA+3`\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>F-2 J-2 K-2 B-2 C-1 H+1 I+1 G+1 L+1 D+1 AA+3</answer>",

To do this, we need to ensure there's space for 'GIJK' to move.\n   - 'GIJK' is blocked by 'HJK' on the top. 'HJK' is also horizontal and can move left or right. We need to move 'HJK' to the left to create space for 'GIJK' to move right.\n\nLet's start solving:\n\n1. Move 'HJK' left: `H-3` (since it's on the first and second rows, we can move it left by 3 spaces to be out of the way of 'GIJK').\n2. Now, 'GIJK' can move right, but first, we need to adjust 'GI' on the third and fourth rows. 'GI' is part of 'GIJK', so moving 'GIJK' right will require checking its path. 'GIJK' can move right by 1 space because it's blocked by being connected and the wall doesn't directly block its immediate move right on the third row but is limited by being a single unit with 'GI' on the fourth row. However, we first need to move 'F' down to allow 'GI' to potentially move.\n   \nLet's directly analyze and provide the moves:\n\n1. `H-3` to move 'HJK' left.\n2. `F+1` (on the third row) is not directly possible because 'F' is vertical. We need to move 'F' down. So, `F+1` (down).\n3. After 'F' moves down, 'GIJK' can potentially move, but we need to ensure 'F' is fully out of the way and other cars are adjusted. \n   - `F+1` again to move it further down.\n\nNow, let's directly solve for 'AA':\n\n1. `B-1` or `B+1` to move 'BB' out of the way. Let's move 'BB' down: `B+2` (since it's vertical and can move down).\n2. Now, 'AA' can potentially move right if 'GIJK' is moved. So, let's directly move 'GIJK' right: `G+1`, `I+1`, `J+1`, `K+1` (all as part of 'GIJK').\n\nLet's simplify and directly give the sequence:\n\nTo simplify, let's directly analyze the necessary moves without detailing every single step due to the complexity and the need for a concise step-by-step guide.\n\nThe solution involves:\n- Moving 'HJK' left.\n- Adjusting 'F' and potentially other cars.\n- Moving 'BB' down.\n- Moving 'GIJK' right.\n- Finally, moving 'AA' right.\n\nLet's directly provide a simplified and corrected sequence of moves.\n\nAfter analyzing the moves:\n`B+2 H-3 F+2 G+1 I+1 J+1 K+1 A+2`\n\n<answer>B+2 H-3 F+2 G+1 I+1 J+1 K+1 A+2</answer>",

The initial state of the board is:\n```\n..BBBI\nx.CCCI\nAA.GHI\n...GH.\n..DDx.\n..EEFF\n```\n2. First, we need to understand the constraints and the orientation of the cars. \n   - 'AA' is a horizontal car, so it can move left or right.\n   - 'BB' is a vertical car, so it can move up or down.\n   - 'C' is a vertical car, so it can move up or down.\n   - 'D' is a vertical car, so it can move up or down.\n   - 'E' and 'F' and 'G' and 'H' and 'I' are cars with different orientations based on their representation on the board.\n\n3. Let's analyze the cars one by one:\n   - 'AA' is blocked by 'B' on the left and there's a wall ('x') below 'C', which is not directly blocking 'AA' but is relevant for 'C'.\n   - To move 'AA' out, we need to clear the path to the right.\n\n4. Let's start by analyzing the necessary moves:\n   - 'B' is a vertical car and is blocking 'AA' indirectly by being on the same row initially but is actually not directly blocking 'AA'. 'B' needs to be moved down to free 'AA' to potentially move right, but 'AA' is already clear to move right if we consider just 'B'. However, 'C' is directly below 'AA' and is blocking the path indirectly because of the wall below it. 'C' needs to move up.\n   - 'C' can move up because it's vertical.\n\nLet's start moving:\n- 'C+1' (move 'C' up by 1 space). The board becomes:\n```\n..BBBI\n.CCCI.\nAA.GHI\n...GH.\n..DDx.\n..EEFF\n```\nHowever, we made an incorrect assumption about 'C' moving directly.

The task is to move the red car 'AA' to the exit on the right. 'AA' is currently positioned at the third row, starting from the left.\n\n2. First, we need to understand the orientation and possible movements of the cars on the board.\n   - 'AA' is horizontal and can move left or right.\n   - 'BBB' is horizontal and can move left or right.\n   - 'F' is vertical and can move up or down. There are two 'F's, but they are considered as one car because they are adjacent and oriented vertically.\n   - 'CCC' and 'DDD' are horizontal and can move left or right.\n\n3. To move 'AA' to the right, we need to clear the path to the right. Currently, 'F' is blocking the path.\n\n4. Let's start by analyzing 'F'. 'F' is vertical and can be moved up or down. To clear the path for 'AA', we need to consider 'F's movement.\n\n5. The steps to solve this:\n   - Move 'F' up to clear the path for 'AA'. Since 'F' is in the second and third row, we can move it up by one space. So, 'F+1' (up by 1 space).\n   - After 'F' is moved up, 'AA' can potentially move right. However, we need to check if 'AA' has enough space to move right. 'BBB' is on the top row and is blocking the potential path for 'F' to move further up if needed, but more importantly, 'CCC' and 'DDD' are below 'AA', and there are no cars to the right of 'AA' on its row except 'F', which we've planned to move.\n   - So, after 'F+1', 'AA' can move right. 'AA' needs to move 3 spaces to the right to exit. So, 'AA+3'.\n\n6. Checking the feasibility:\n   - 'F' is at the 2nd and 3rd row. 'F+1' means moving it up, so it's a valid move because it can go up to the 1st row. Thus, 'F+1'.\n   - After 'F+1', the board changes, and 'AA' can move right. 'AA+3' is needed to reach the exit, but let's check if it's directly possible after 'F+1'.\n\n7. Let's directly examine the moves needed:\n   - 'F+1' is the first move to clear 'F' from 'AA's path.\n   - Then 'AA+3' to move 'AA' out.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that other cars don't block the required moves or that the moves are valid given the constraints of other cars.\n\nLet's directly specify the moves:\n1. 'F+1' to move 'F' up.\n2. Then, 'AA+3' to move 'AA' to the exit.\n\nOther cars like 'BBB', 'CCC', and 'DDD' are not directly in the way for 'AA' to exit after 'F' is moved.\n\nThe sequence of moves is 'F+1 AA+3'.\n\nLet's verify if there are any other necessary moves:\n- 'BBB' is on the top and doesn't directly interfere with 'AA's movement to the right after 'F' is moved.\n- 'CCC' and 'DDD' are below 'AA' and don't interfere.\n\nThe final sequence is: F+1 AA+3\n\nThe answer is: <answer>F+1 AA+3</answer>",

'G' is also blocking 'C' and is on top of 'E'. 'D' is below 'F' and 'C'. 'B' is on the left and is blocking 'F'.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the moves needed:\n\n- 'B' needs to move left to free 'F'. \n- 'F' needs to move up or down.\n- 'G' needs to move right or down to free 'AA'.\n- 'C' needs to move left or right to allow 'G' to move down.\n\nLet's break it down further:\n\n1. Move 'B' left to free 'F': `B-1` (3 times, as it's 3 units long) = `B-3`\n2. Move 'F' up: `F-2` (as it's currently on the 3rd row and needs to go up to the 1st row, but it's blocked by 'B', so it can move up after 'B' is moved) = Not possible directly. Let's start with `B-3`.\n3. After 'B' is moved left, 'F' can be moved up. `F-2`\n4. Now, 'C' can move right: `C+1`\n5. 'G' can move down: `G+1` (in terms of rows, it's moving down, but the notation is based on the column or row it's on and its orientation). Since 'G' is horizontal, it moves right or left. So, it can move right: `G+1`\n6. 'AA' can now move right: `A+1` (twice, as it needs to clear the current position and move further right) = `A+2`\n7. 'AA' is still not out. We need to ensure the path is clear.\n\nLet's sequence the moves properly:\n\n1. `B-3` to move 'B' left.\n2. `F-2` to move 'F' up.\n3. `C+1` to move 'C' right.\n4. `G+1` to move 'G' right.\n5. `A+2` to move 'A' right.\n\nSo, the sequence is: `B-3 F-2 C+1 G+1 A+2`\n\nLet's check if 'A' is out after `A+2`. It should be, as the board is 6 columns wide, and 'A' starts at column 3, so moving 2 columns to the right puts it at column 5, and it's a 2-unit long car, so it will be at columns 5 and 6, thus exiting.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>B-3 F-2 C+1 G+1 A+2</answer>",

First, let's understand the positions and orientations of the cars:\n   - AA is horizontal and needs to move right.\n   - F is vertical.\n   - B is horizontal.\n   - J is vertical.\n   - I is vertical.\n   - C is vertical.\n   - G is vertical.\n   - H is vertical.\n   - D is horizontal.\n   - K is horizontal.\n   - L is vertical.\n\n3. To move AA to the right, we need to clear the path. AA is currently blocked by other cars and possibly walls.\n\nLet's start analyzing and moving the cars step by step:\n\n1. The car 'K' is blocking 'AA'. 'K' is horizontal and can move left or right. To clear 'AA', 'K' needs to move right. However, 'K' is also blocking 'J', and there's another 'K' to its right. So, we first need to move 'J' up to free 'K'.\n\n2. 'J' is vertical and can move up or down. Let's move 'J' up.\n\nLet's start with 'J+2' to move it up and free the space for 'K'. However, we need to check if 'J' can actually move up. 'J' is at the second and first rows, so it can move up.\n\nMove 'J' up: J+2.\n\nAfter J+2:\n   FB.JJ.\n   F.I.K.\n   AAI.K.\n   CCI..L\n   GHDDDL\n   GHEEx.\n\nNow 'K' can move right.

'I' is vertical and can be moved up or down. 'K' is horizontal and can be moved left or right.\n   - To move 'AA' to the right, we need to clear the path by moving 'I' and 'K'.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Movement:**\n\n### Initial Assessment\n- 'AA' is at the third row, spanning the third and fourth columns. It needs to move two spaces to the right to exit.\n- 'I' is blocking 'AA'. 'I' is vertical and is in the second and third rows. It can be moved up or down.\n- 'K' is also on the same row as 'AA' and is blocking its path further to the right.\n\n### Moves\n1. Move 'I' up to clear the path for 'AA'.

'J-2'\n2. 'K-2'\n3. 'AA+2'\n\nAnd the moves to enable these:\n- 'F-1' and 'B-1' to move 'F' and 'B' left, allowing 'J' to move up.\n- The detailed sequence involves moving 'F', 'B', 'J', 'K', and then 'AA'.\n\nLet's simplify:\n1. Move 'F' and 'B' left: 'F-1 B-1'\n2. Move 'J' up: 'J-2'\n3. Move 'C' down: 'C+1' to allow 'K' to move left.\n4. Move 'K' left: 'K-2'\n5.

The given board is:\n```\n..xBBJ\nCCCDDJ\n..AA.K\nG.HEEK\nG.HIFF\n...I..\n```\n2. The task is to move the red car 'AA' to the exit on the right. 'AA' is currently in the third row and is blocked by other cars and possibly walls.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the position of 'AA' and other relevant cars:\n- 'AA' is in the third row and is horizontally oriented, so it can move left or right.\n- 'AA' is blocked on the left by a wall ('x' is in the same column as the leftmost 'A') and on the right by 'K'.\n\nFirst, we need to move 'K' out of the way to allow 'AA' to move right.\n\n1. 'K' is vertically oriented, so it can move up or down. To clear 'AA's path, 'K' needs to move either up or down.\n2. Looking at 'K's position relative to other cars and walls:\n   - 'K' is blocked on the top by 'B' and 'J', and 'B' is further blocked by 'C' on the left and 'x' on the left as well.\n   - 'K' can potentially move down. To do so, we need to clear the path below it.\n\nLet's analyze the moves needed step by step:\n\n1. Move 'I' down to clear some space and potentially allow other cars to move: 'I-2' (since 'I' is vertically oriented and can move up/down).\n2. 'I' is at the bottom, so moving it down is not possible as it is already at the edge. Let's directly examine 'K'. 'K' can move down if 'E' moves out of the way.\n\nTo move 'E' (which is horizontally oriented), we need to consider its movement:\n- 'E' is blocked on the right by 'K'. If 'K' moves down, 'E' can potentially move.\n\nLet's directly analyze and specify the moves:\n1. Move 'K' down: For 'K' to move down, the space below it needs to be clear. 'E' is in the way. 'E' can move right if 'K' is out of the way, but 'K' is blocking 'E'. So, we need to rearrange other cars.\n\nLet's directly plan the moves:\n- 'F' is below 'E' and is horizontally oriented. Moving 'F' right could help.\n- 'H' is above 'G' and is vertically oriented. We can potentially move 'H' up.\n\nLet's start with actual moves:\n1. Move 'H' up: 'H+1' is not possible because 'H' is vertically oriented and can move up/down, so we say 'H-1'.\n2. Then, we can move 'F' right to give space: 'F+1'.\n3. 'E' can now move right: 'E+1'.\n4. Now 'K' can move down: 'K-1'.\n5. With 'K' out of the way, 'AA' can move right: 'AA+2' to reach the exit.\n\nLet's sequence these moves properly and check for any other necessary moves.\n\n1. 'H-1'\n2. 'F+1'\n3. 'E+1'\n4. 'K-1'\n5. 'AA+2'\n\nLet's verify if there are any other necessary moves or if these moves are valid given the constraints of the board.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n- 'H-1' is valid.\n- 'F+1' is valid.\n- 'E+1' is valid because 'K' is still there, so we need to reconsider the order or other moves.\n- Let's directly move 'I' down to start freeing up space: 'I-2'.\n\nRevisiting and directly specifying the sequence with necessary adjustments:\n1. 'I-2'\n2. 'H-1'\n3. 'F+1'\n4. 'E+1'\n5. 'K-1'\n6.

We need to consider other movements.\n\n5. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - First, let's move 'D' right to potentially free 'J' or create space: `D+1`\n   - The board now looks like: \n     ```\n     ..xBBJ\n     CCCDDJ\n     ..AA.K\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n     Becomes:\n     ```\n     ..xBBJ\n     CCC.DJ\n     ..AA.K\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n   - 'J' can move right now because 'D' has moved: `J+1`\n     ```\n     ..xBB.J\n     CCC.DJ\n     ..AA.K\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n     Becomes (after `J+1`):\n     ```\n     ..xBB.J\n     CCC.D.J\n     ..AA.K\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n   - Move 'B' left to free 'J': `B-1`\n     ```\n     ..xB.J\n     CCC.D.J\n     ..AA.K\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n   - Now, 'J' can be moved left: `J-2`\n     ```\n     ..xBJ\n     CCC.DJ\n     ..AA.K\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n     Becomes (after `J-2`):\n     ```\n     ..xBJ\n     CCCDJ\n     ..AA.K\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n   - Move 'C' down to free 'AA': `C+1`\n     ```\n     ..xBJ\n     CCCDJ\n     ..AA.K\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n     Becomes (after `C+1`):\n     ```\n     ..xBJ\n     .CCDJ\n     ..AA.K\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n     And then 'C' is still on the way, so we actually need to directly work on 'AA' and 'K'.\n\n   - Let's directly move 'K' down to free 'AA': `K+1`\n     ```\n     ..xBJ\n     CCCDJ\n     ..AA.K\n     G.HEEK\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n     Becomes (after `K+1`):\n     ```\n     ..xBJ\n     CCCDJ\n     ..AAK\n     G.HE.K\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n   - Now 'AA' can move right: `AA+2`\n     ```\n     ..xBJ\n     CCCDJ\n     ....K\n     G.HEAA\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n     Becomes (after `AA+2`):\n     ```\n     ..xBJ\n     CCCDJ\n     .....K\n     G.HE.AA\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n     And then (after another move):\n     ```\n     ..xBJ\n     CCCDJ\n     ......K\n     G.HE..AA\n     G.HIFF\n     ...I..\n     ```\n\nLet's directly provide a simplified and correct sequence of moves to achieve the task.\n\nThe sequence to solve involves several steps including moving 'D', 'J', 'B', 'C', 'K', and finally 'AA'. Let's directly analyze and simplify:\n\n1. `D+1`, `J+1`, `B-1`, `J-2`, `K+1`, `AA+2`, `AA+1` (if needed, based on the exact position after 'K+1').\n\nLet's directly formulate a valid sequence:\n`D+1 J+1 B-1 J-2 K+1 AA+2`\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>D+1 J+1 B-1 J-2 K+1 AA+2 AA+1</answer> \nHowever, to follow the exact format as requested without directly checking the validity of `AA+1` in the final step due to the lack of intermediate state verification in this response, we simplify to the most direct answer format requested.\n\n<answer>D+1 J+1 B-1 J-2 K+1 AA+3</answer>",

'M' is vertical and is blocked by 'L' at the top and 'E' and 'N' at the bottom. We need to move 'L' and then adjust other cars to free 'M'.\n   - 'L' is horizontal and can be moved left. To move 'L' left, we need to ensure 'J' and 'K' are out of the way. 'J' and 'K' are vertical, so they can move up or down.\n\nLet's start solving:\n- Move 'J' down: J+1\n- 'K' is still in the way, so move 'K' down: K+1\n- Now 'L' can move left: L-2 (since it needs to move past 'J' and 'K' which are now down)\n- 'M' is now free to move up or down. Since 'E' is below it and is part of 'EE' which is horizontal, we need to adjust 'E' or 'M'. Let's move 'M' down: M+1\n- 'E' can move right since it's part of 'EE': E+2 (to make space for 'M' moving down further if needed, but actually, we need to free 'N')\n- To free 'N', we need to look at 'H' and 'G'. 'N' is blocked by 'H' and 'G' indirectly because 'H' is part of 'HHH'. Let's adjust 'H' and 'G'.\n\nLet's continue:\n- Move 'H' down: H+1 (this will help in adjusting 'N')\n- 'G' is vertical and can move up or down. Move 'G' down: G+1 (though this isn't directly necessary, it helps in understanding that 'G' can be moved)\n- 'N' can now potentially move right if 'H' and others are adjusted. Let's directly adjust 'N': N+1 (since 'H' has moved down)\n- 'M' can now move down further: M+1 (since 'E' has moved right)\n- Now 'AA' can potentially move right if 'M' is out of the way. 'M' is below 'AA', so it needs to be moved down further or 'L' needs to be adjusted back.\n\nLet's directly address 'AA':\n- The direct path for 'AA' is blocked by 'M'. We've already moved 'M' down. Let's continue:\n- 'L' can move back right: L+2\n- 'AA' can now move right: A+1 (if the path is clear)\n\nLet's detail the moves:\n1. J+1\n2. K+1\n3. L-2\n4. M+1\n5. E+2\n6. H+1\n7. G+1\n8. N+1 (though this might not be directly necessary with the moves we've planned, it helps 'N')\n9. M+1\n10. L+2\n11. A+1\n12. A+1 (to exit, as the first move only takes it to the edge)\n\nThus, the sequence of moves is: J+1 K+1 L-2 M+1 E+2 H+1 G+1 N+1 M+1 L+2 A+1 A+1\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>J+1 K+1 L-2 M+1 E+2 H+1 G+1 N+1 M+1 L+2 A+1 A+1</answer>",

To move it out, we need to clear the path for it to move right.\n\n2. **Blocking 'AA':** 'K' is to the right of 'AA', blocking its path.\n\n3. **'K' Position and Movement:** 'K' is vertical and spans across the second, third, and fourth rows. To move 'K', we need to move it either up or down.\n\n4. **Clearing 'K':** To move 'K' down, we need to ensure there's space below it. 'K' is on the fourth column. Looking at the fourth column, 'I' is below 'K', and 'I' is also vertical, spanning across the fourth and fifth rows. So, 'K' can be moved down if 'I' is moved down.\n\nLet's start moving vehicles to clear the path for 'AA':\n\n1. **Move 'I' Down:** To move 'I' down, we need to check if there's space. 'I' is on the fourth and fifth rows. We can move 'I' down by 1 space because there's 'E' (which is horizontal and can be moved) below it on the fifth row, and 'E' can be moved to make space for 'I'.\n   \n2. **Initial Moves:**\n   - Move 'E' left to make space for 'I': `E-2` (since 'E' is on the fifth and sixth columns, moving it left by 2 spaces will clear the path for 'I' to move down).\n   - Then, move 'I' down: `I+1`\n   \n3. **Continuing the Moves:**\n   - Now that 'I' is down, 'K' can be moved down: `K+1`\n   - With 'K' moved, 'AA' can move right: `A+1`\n\nLet's detail the steps and formulate the moves:\n\n1. `E-2` to clear the path for 'I'.\n2. `I+1` to move 'I' down.\n3. `K+1` to move 'K' down.\n4. `A+1` to move 'AA' out.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are any other vehicles blocking the path or if there are any dependencies.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n- 'H' is blocking 'K' from being moved down directly without considering 'H'. 'H' is horizontal and can be moved left or right. We need to ensure 'H' doesn't block 'K'.\n\nLet's reassess and directly formulate the required sequence of moves based on the task:\n\n1. **Initial Assessment:**\n   - 'E' needs to be moved left to allow 'I' to move down: `E-2`\n   - 'I' moves down: `I+1`\n   - 'K' moves down: `K+1`\n   - 'AA' moves right: `A+1`\n\n2. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - Before moving 'K', 'H' needs to be out of the way. 'H' can be moved left: `H-1` (on the third row, 'H' is to the left of 'AA', so moving it left clears the path for 'K' to move down).\n\nLet's directly calculate the moves:\n1. Move 'H' left: `H-1`\n2. Move 'E' left: `E-2`\n3. Move 'I' down: `I+1`\n4. Move 'K' down: `K+1`\n5. Move 'AA' right: `A+1`\n\nThe sequence is: `H-1 E-2 I+1 K+1 A+1`\n\n<answer>H-1 E-2 I+1 K+1 A+1</answer>",

It's currently blocked by K, so we need to move K out of the way.\n   - K is vertical, so it can move up or down. Let's examine its possible movements.\n\n4. **Analyzing K's Movement:**\n   - K is on the second and third rows. To move AA to the right, we need to clear K from the third row.\n   - K can move up since there's space on the second row for it to move into (though it's partially blocked by J, we can rearrange J or other cars to facilitate this).\n\n5. **Detailed Steps:**\n   - Let's start by moving J (which is vertical and can move up or down) to create space for K to move.\n   - J is on the second and third rows. If J moves down, it will be on the third and fourth rows, potentially freeing K to move up.\n\n6. **Executing the Plan:**\n   - Move J down by 1: `J+1`\n   - Now K can move up by 1: `K-1`\n   - With K moved, AA can move to the right. Let's move AA to the right by 1: `A+1` (since AA is a single entity for movement purposes, we'll treat it as 'A').\n   - AA is still blocked by the wall on the right (implied by the edge of the grid and the presence of 'x' on the left and bottom left), so it needs to be moved further right until it exits.\n\n7. **Continuing the Movement:**\n   - After `K-1`, AA can move right. So, `A+1`.\n   - To continue, let's analyze the board after `J+1` and `K-1`:\n     - After `J+1`, the board changes, and K moves up.\n   - Let's directly plan the moves:\n     1. `J+1` to move J down.\n     2. `K-1` to move K up.\n     3. `A+2` to move AA to the right, exiting.\n\n8. **Other Necessary Moves:**\n   - Before `A+2`, we need to ensure that the path is clear and other cars are positioned correctly.\n   - Let's directly examine necessary moves:\n     - `H` is blocking `A` on the left; we need to move `H`.\n     - `H` can move up or down. Let's move `H` up: `H-2` (since it's on the third row and can move up to the first row).\n\n8. **Formulating the Moves:**\n   - `H-2` (Move H up by 2 spaces to free AA).\n   - `J+1` (Move J down by 1 space).\n   - `K-1` (Move K up by 1 space).\n   - `A+2` (Move AA to the right by 2 spaces to exit).\n\n9. **Final Move Sequence:**\n   - The moves are `H-2 J+1 K-1 A+2`.\n\nLet's put it all together in the required format:\n<answer>H-2 J+1 K-1 A+2</answer>",

To free 'AA', 'BBB' needs to move up.\n- 'H' and 'I' are on the same row as 'AA' but are not directly blocking it. However, 'H' is between 'AA' and 'J', and 'J' is blocked by 'CC' and 'DD'. 'CC' and 'DD' are horizontally oriented and need to be moved to the left to free 'J', and subsequently 'H'.\n- 'F' is vertically oriented and is blocking 'C'. 'F' needs to move either up or down to potentially free other cars.\n\nLet's start moving the cars:\n1. Move 'BBB' up to free 'AA': `BBB-3` or `B-3` (since 'BBB' is a single entity, we'll refer to it as 'B').\n2. Move 'AA' to the right. Initially, it's blocked, so we need to clear the path.\n\nLet's start with the given state and apply step-by-step movements:\n- 'B' is in the way, so `B-3` (move 'B' up by 3 spaces).\n- After `B-3`, the state becomes:\n```\nB..HI.\n..BHI.\nAA.HJ.\nF.CCJ.\nF.GDD.\nEEG...\n```\nNow 'AA' can potentially move right, but 'H' and 'J' are in the way.\n\n- 'H' is blocked by 'I' on the right. 'I' is horizontally oriented and can move left or right. So, `I+1` to move 'I' right.\n- After `I+1`, 'H' can move right: `H+1`.\n- The state now is:\n```\nB...H.I\n..B.HI\nAAHJ..\nF.CCJ.\nF.GDD.\nEEG...\n```\n- Now 'AA' can move right: `A+2` (since 'AA' is two units long and we are considering it as a single entity 'A').\n\nLet's continue:\n- Before `A+2`, we need to ensure 'J' is out of the way. 'J' is blocked by 'CC'. 'CC' is horizontally oriented, so it can move left or right. `C-2` (or `CC-2`) to move 'CC' left.\n- After `C-2`, 'J' can move down: `J-1` (since moving down is the only viable option to get it out of 'AA's way, considering the grid and other cars).\n\nLet's summarize and directly plan the sequence:\n1. `B-3` to move 'B' up.\n2. `I+1` to move 'I' right, freeing 'H'.\n3. `H+1` to move 'H' right.\n4. `C-2` to move 'C' (or 'CC') left, potentially freeing 'J'.\n5. `J-1` to move 'J' down.\n6. `A+2` or simply `A+4` if directly possible after other cars are moved.\n\nLet's directly construct a feasible sequence:\n1. `B-3`\n2. `C-2`\n3. `J-1`\n4. `I+1`\n5. `H+1`\n6. `A+4`\n\nTranslating this into the required format:\n`B-3 C-2 J-1 I+1 H+1 A+4`\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>B-3 C-2 J-1 I+1 H+1 A+4</answer>",

It needs to move to the right to exit.\n   - The car is blocked by `H` and `J` on its right path. `H` is also blocking `J`'s movement to the right. `J` is blocked by `C` and `C` is blocked by `B` on the left and potentially others on the right or in its path to move up or down.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the moves needed to clear the path for `AA`.\n\n1. **Clearing the Path for `AA`:**\n   - `AA` is on the third row. To move it to the right, we need to clear `H` and `J`.\n   - `H` is on the first, second, and third rows. It's vertically oriented, so it can move up or down. Moving it up is possible as there's space.\n   - `J` is on the third and fourth rows. It's also vertically oriented. To move `J`, we need to consider its path.\n\nLet's start moving vehicles to clear the path.\n\n1. **Move `H` up:**\n   - `H` is in the way. Let's move it up. `H+2` (since it's in the 3rd column and needs to move up 2 spaces to get out of the way).\n\n2. **Other necessary moves:**\n   - Before moving `H`, we need to ensure that `I` (which is next to `H` on the right in the first and second rows) is not blocking its path. `I` can move right as it's horizontally oriented.\n\nLet's analyze and specify the moves step by step.\n\n1. `I` is blocking `H`'s upward movement indirectly because it's next to it, but `I` can move right. So, `I+1` or more if possible.\n\nLet's start with the actual moves based on the initial configuration:\n- `I` is on the first and second rows, third column. It can move right. So, `I+3` to get it out of the way.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. `I+3` (Moving `I` to the right to make space)\n   ```\n   ...HI. -> ....H.I\n   BBBHI. -> BBBH.I\n   ```\n\n   New State:\n   ```\n   ....H.I\n   BBBH.I\n   AA.HJ.\n   F.CCJ.\n   F.GDD.\n   EEG...\n   ```\n\n2. `H-2` (Moving `H` up)\n   ```\n   ....H.I -> ....I\n   BBBH.I -> BBB.I\n   AA.HJ. -> AA.J.\n   ```\n\n   New State:\n   ```\n   ....I\n   BBB.I\n   AA.J.\n   F.CCJ.\n   F.GDD.\n   EEG...\n   ```\n\n3. Now, let's move `J` down to clear the path for `AA`. `J+1`\n   ```\n   AA.J. -> AA..\n   F.CCJ. -> F.CC.\n   F.GDD. -> F.GDD\n   ```\n\n   New State:\n   ```\n   ....I\n   BBB.I\n   AA..\n   F.CC.\n   F.GDD.\n   EEG...\n   ```\n\n4. Move `B` left to give `C` space to move. `B-3`\n   ```\n   BBB.I ->    .I\n   ```\n\n   New State:\n   ```\n   ....I\n      .I\n   AA..\n   F.CC.\n   F.GDD.\n   EEG...\n   ```\n\n5. Move `C` right. `C+2`\n   ```\n   F.CC. -> FCCC.\n   ```\n\n   New State (after adjusting for the actual move):\n   ```\n   ....I\n      .I\n   AA..\n   FCCC.\n   F.GDD.\n   EEG...\n   ```\n\n6. Move `C` down. `C+1`\n   ```\n   FCCC. -> \n   F.GDD. -> \n   ```\n\n   Actual Move:\n   - `C` moves down: \n     ```\n     FCCC.\n     F.GDD.\n     ```\n     becomes\n     ```\n     F..C.\n     FGDD.\n     ```\n\n   New State:\n   ```\n   ....I\n      .I\n   AA..\n   F..C.\n   FGDD.\n   EEG...\n   ```\n\n7. Finally, move `AA` to the right. `A+2`\n   ```\n   AA.. -> AA..\n   ```\n\n   Actual Move:\n   - `AA` is already clear to move right. So, `A+4` (since it needs to exit).\n\nThe sequence of moves is:\n1. `I+3`\n2. `H-2`\n3. `J+1`\n4. `B-3`\n5. `C+2`\n6. `C+1`\n7. `A+4`\n\nLet's simplify and directly provide the final sequence in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>I+3 H-2 J+1 B-3 C+2 C+1 A+4</answer>",

Now, AA can move right: `A+1` (and potentially more if the path remains clear).\n\n4. `A+1` : \n   - AA moves right.\n\nLet's continue this process until AA reaches the exit.\n\nAfter `F+2` and `G+1`, the state is as described.

To do this, AA needs to move to the right until it is out of the grid or reaches the rightmost edge.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the initial position and the necessary steps to free AA and move it out.\n\n1. **Initial State**: AA is blocked by G. To move AA to the right, we first need to clear the path by moving G.\n\n2. **First Moves**: \n   - G is vertical and can be moved up or down. To clear the path for AA, we need to move G either up or down. Since H is on top of G and is horizontal, spanning across the first and second rows at the fourth column, moving G up is not possible without first moving H. So, we should consider moving G down.\n\n3. **Moving G Down**: To move G down, the space below it needs to be clear. The current state of the board below G is 'F' at the fourth row, third column.

The red car (AA) is positioned horizontally at the third row, starting from the third column. To move it to the exit, it needs to move to the right.\n\n2. The car is blocked by car 'G'.

Let's move 'F' to the right: `F+2` (since it needs to clear 'C' which is 3 units long).\n\n2. Before moving 'F', 'C' needs to move out of 'F's way. 'C' is horizontal and can move left or right. Let's move 'C' to the left: `C-3`.\n\n3. Now, let's move 'F' to the right: `F+2`.\n\n4. 'G' is vertical and can move up or down. To free 'AA', let's move 'G' down: `G+2`.\n\n5. Now 'AA' can move.

Move 'G' down: G+1.\n   - Now 'AA' can potentially move. However, 'C' is below 'A', so we need to clear 'C'. 'C' is horizontally oriented and can move left or right. Move 'C' right: C+1 (or more if needed, but first, let's check if +1 is enough).\n   - After 'C' moves right, 'F' is still below 'A'. 'F' is vertically oriented, so it can move up or down. Move 'F' up: F-2 (since it's on the 4th and 5th rows).\n   - Now 'AA' can move right. Move 'AA' right: A+3 (to exit).\n\nLet's formalize these steps into the required format:\n\n1. E+1 (Move 'E' down to free 'H')\n2. H+1 (Move 'H' right)\n3. G+1 (Move 'G' down)\n4. C+2 (Move 'C' right to clear the path for 'A')\n5. F-2 (Move 'F' up to allow 'A' to move)\n6.

'L' can move up or down, and 'D' can potentially be moved.\n\nLet's directly give the sequence:\n`B+1 I-1 K+1 J+1 AA+2`\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that all the moves are valid and that we haven't missed any necessary steps or preconditions for these moves.\n\nThe final sequence after re-evaluating is indeed focused on freeing 'AA'. Let's directly check the validity of the steps and provide the final sequence.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>B+1 I-1 K+1 J+1 AA+2</answer> or a more detailed valid sequence if necessary.\n\nHowever, upon a detailed examination:\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>B+1 I-1 D-1 K+1 J+1 AA+2</answer> is a more accurate representation after re-checking the steps and the board configuration for a valid path.\n\nLet's directly output the final answer in the required format:\n<answer>B+1 I-1 D-1 K+1 J+1 AA+2</answer>",

To exit, it needs to move two spaces to the right.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the initial position and identifying the necessary steps:\n\n1. `AA` is blocked by `J` and `L` on its right. `J` is part of the vehicle `IJ`, and `L` is part of `BBL` or `J.L` and `DDL`. To move `AA` to the right, we need to clear the path by moving `IJ` and `L` (or the cars they are part of) out of the way.\n\n2. `IJ` is a vertical car. To clear the path for `AA`, we need to move `IJ` up or down. Since `I` is at the third row and `J` is at the second row, we can move `IJ` up.\n\n3. Let's analyze the moves step by step.\n\nFirst, observe that `B` and `C` are vertical cars and can be moved up or down. `L` is part of a horizontal car (`J.L` or just consider the movement of `L` as part of `DDL` or `BBL`), and `D` is also part of a horizontal car (`DDL`). \n\nLet's start moving cars to free `AA`:\n\n- Move `IJ` up: `I+1 J+1` is not possible because `J` is already at the top it can be. So, we need to think about other cars.\n\n- Notice that `B` can move down (`B-1`), and `C` can also move down (`C-1`), which will allow `L` (as part of `DDL` or considered with `J`) to potentially move.\n\nLet's think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move `C` down: `C-1`\n2. Move `B` down: `B-1`\n3. Now, `L` (as part of `DDL`) can move right: `D+1 L+1`\n4. `IJ` can move up: `I+1 J+1` is still not an option because `J` is at the top. However, we can move `F` down (`F-1`), then `H` down (`H-1`), and `K` right (`K+1`), but first, we need to free `K`.\n\nLet's directly plan the moves required to free `AA` and move it out.\n\n1. `C-1` (Move `C` down)\n2. `B-1` (Move `B` down)\n3. `D+1 L+1` (Move `D` and `L` right)\n4. Since `J` is part of `IJ` and can't move up further, let's focus on other moves.\n5. `F-1` (Move `F` down)\n6. `H-1` (Move `H` down)\n7. `K+1` (Move `K` right)\n8. `A+2` (Move `A`/`AA` right)\n\nLet's put the moves together in the required format.\n\nThe sequence is: `C-1 B-1 D+1 L+1 F-1 H-1 K+1 A+2`\n\n<answer>C-1 B-1 D+1 L+1 F-1 H-1 K+1 A+2</answer>",

'F' can be moved down to free 'I': `F+1`, and then 'I' can be moved right: `I+1`.\n\nLet's put it all together with the correct sequence and check for any additional required moves.\n\n1. `B-2` to move 'B' up.\n2. `K-2` to move 'K' left.\n3. `D-3` to move 'D' left.\n4. `C-2` to move 'C' left.\n5. `F+1` to move 'F' down.\n6. `I+1` to move 'I' right.\n7. `G+2` to move 'G' right, as 'I' has moved.\n8. `H-1` to move 'H' up.\n9. `J+2` to move 'J' down.\n10. `A+3` to move 'AA' out.\n\nThus, the sequence is: `B-2 K-2 D-3 C-2 F+1 I+1 G+2 H-1 J+2 A+3`\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>B-2 K-2 D-3 C-2 F+1 I+1 G+2 H-1 J+2 A+3</answer>",

'AA' is currently in the third row.\n   - The exit is on the right side, implying 'AA' needs to be moved to the rightmost end of its row.\n\n3. **Analyzing 'AA's Movement:**\n   - 'AA' is in the third row: `HAAJ..`\n   - To move 'AA' to the right, we need to clear the path by moving 'J' out of the way since 'H' is vertical and cannot move horizontally.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Movement:**\n   - First, let's move 'J' down to clear the path for 'AA'.

To move 'J', we first observe 'E' is blocking 'J'. 'E' is horizontal, so it can move left or right. \n   - Move 'E' left: `JEE` -> `JE.` ( Move 'E' left by 1: E-1).\n   - Now 'J' can move down into the space vacated by 'E'. So, `J..` -> `...` and `JE.` -> `J..` ( Move 'J' down by 1: J+1).\n   - After 'J' moves down, 'AA' can move right. Initially, 'AA' is at `HAAJ..`. After 'J' moves down, it becomes `HAA...`. So, 'AA' can move to `HAAA..` is not possible because there's no more space, but it can move right by one: `HAA...` ( Move 'AA' right by 1: A+1).\n\nLet's directly formulate the sequence:\n1. Move 'E' left by 1: E-1\n2. Move 'J' down by 1: J+1\n3. Move 'AA' right by 1: A+1\n\nLet's check if 'AA' has reached the exit. It's not there yet, so we continue.\n\nContinuing this process:\n- After `A+1`, 'AA' is at `..AA..`. We need to continue.\n- To move 'AA' further right, we check the path. Now 'D' is in the way in the second row, and 'K' is also in the way in the first and second rows.\n\nLet's directly calculate the necessary moves:\n1. `K` is vertical, so it can move up or down. Move 'K' up: `K` is in `BBB.xK` and `CCDDDK`, so `K+1` (up) is possible. (K-1)\n2. Move 'D' left: 'D' is in `CCDDDK`, so we can do D-1 (or more if needed).\n3.

'J' and 'K' need to be moved to allow 'AA' to move right.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Movement:**\n   - First, let's move 'K'. 'K' is on the second and third rows, so it's vertical. We can move it up or down. To free 'AA', we need to move 'K' up. 'K' is on the third row, so we can move it up by 1 or 2 steps since it's on the second row as well. Let's move 'K' up by 2 steps: `K-2`.\n   - After `K-2`, 'K' will be on the first row. The state will be:\n     ```\n     BBH.CC\n     .GHA.K\n     .GAA.J\n     DD.IJL\n     ...IxL\n     .EEFFL\n     ```\n   - Now, let's move 'J'. 'J' is vertical and is on the third and fourth rows. We can move it down. Let's move 'J' down by 2 steps: `J+2`.\n   - After `J+2`, 'J' will be on the fifth and sixth rows (if it weren't for 'L' and 'x', it could move further). The state will be:\n     ```\n     BBH.CC\n     .GHA.K\n     .GAA.\n     DD.I.\n     ...IJL\n     .EEFFL\n     ```\n   - Now, 'AA' is free to move. Let's move 'AA' right by 2 steps to exit: `A+2`.\n\n4. **Other Necessary Moves:**\n   - Before moving 'AA', we need to ensure that 'H' is out of the way. 'H' is vertical and is on the first, second, and third rows. Let's move 'H' up by 2 steps: `H-2`.\n   - 'G' is also in the way of 'H'. 'G' is vertical, so let's move 'G' up by 1 step: `G-1`.\n\nLet's sequence these moves properly and check for any other obstacles.\n\n1. Move 'H' up: `H-2`\n2. Move 'G' up: `G-1`\n3. Move 'K' up: `K-2`\n4. Move 'J' down: `J+2`\n5. Move 'AA' right: `A+2`\n\nLet's verify the moves:\n- `H-2` is valid as 'H' moves from the second and third rows to the first row (and off the board, but that's okay as it moves out of the way).\n- `G-1` is valid, 'G' moves up.\n- `K-2` is valid, 'K' moves up.\n- `J+2` is valid, 'J' moves down.\n- `A+2` is valid, 'AA' exits.\n\nThe sequence is: `H-2 G-1 K-2 J+2 A+2`\n\nLet's format it as per the requirement: `H-2 G-1 K-2 J+2 A+2`\n\n<answer>H-2 G-1 K-2 J+2 A+2</answer>",

'AA' is currently positioned horizontally in the third row, between 'G' and 'J'. The steps to move 'AA' out involve clearing a path to the right and then moving 'AA' out.\n\n1. **Initial State**: 'AA' is in the third row, third and fourth columns.\n\n2. **First Observation**: To move 'AA' to the right, we need to clear the space to its right. 'J' is blocking its path.\n\n3. **Moving 'J'**: 'J' is in the fourth and fifth columns of the third and fourth rows. It's oriented vertically, so it can move up or down. To clear 'AA's path, we need to move 'J' down.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the necessary moves:\n\n1. Move 'J' down: 'J' is currently in the way. To move 'J' down, we first observe it's in rows 3 and 4. We can move it down by one row.\n\n   - 'J-1' is not possible because 'J' is vertical and can only move up or down. So, we need to move it down: 'J+1'.\n\n2. Before moving 'J', let's analyze the board again and see if there are any other cars that need to be moved to allow 'J' to move down.\n\n   - 'L' is below 'J' and is oriented horizontally. To move 'J' down, 'L' needs to be moved out of the way. 'L' is in the fourth and fifth rows and is blocked by 'I' and 'x' on its left and 'F' on its right in different rows. 'L' can move left or right.\n\n3. Let's examine 'L's movement:\n   - 'L' is in columns 4 and 5 in row 4 and columns 5 and 6 in rows 5 and 6. 'L' can move left or right. To move 'J' down, 'L' needs to be moved to the right to create space.\n\n4. **Moving 'L' to the right**: 'L+1' is possible if there's space.\n\nLet's break down the steps further and directly specify the moves required to achieve the task.\n\n1. 'L' is blocking 'J's downward movement. 'L' needs to move right. \n   - To move 'L' right, we check its position: 'L' is in column 5 or 6. 'L+1' is a valid move if we can clear the rightmost column or if 'L' is not too far to the right.\n\n2. Before 'L+1', we need to ensure 'F' (which is below 'L' in the last row and is oriented horizontally) is moved out of the way if necessary.\n\nLet's directly analyze and specify the moves:\n- 'L' is in the way for 'J'. 'L' can move right. So, 'L+1'.\n- 'J' can then move down: 'J+1'.\n- Now 'AA' can move right.\n\nLet's start with the actual moves:\n1. Move 'I' up to free 'L': 'I-1'.\n2. Move 'L' right: 'L+1'.\n3. Move 'J' down: 'J+1'.\n4. Move 'AA' right: 'AA+2' (since it can now move two spaces to the right to exit).\n\nOther necessary moves to free the required cars:\n- 'C' is not directly in the way but let's check the initial moves required to free 'AA'.\n- 'H' is above 'AA' and is vertical, so it can move up or down. 'H-1' is possible.\n\nLet's directly write the sequence:\n1. 'H-1' to free some space and potentially help in other moves.\n2. 'I-1' to allow 'L' to move.\n3. 'L+1' to clear 'J's path down.\n4. 'J+1' to clear 'AA's path right.\n5. 'AA+2' to move 'AA' out.\n\nLet's verify and directly give the moves:\nThe sequence is: 'H-1 I-1 L+1 J+1 AA+2'.\n\nLet's put the answer in the required format:\n<answer>H-1 I-1 L+1 J+1 AA+2</answer>",

'AA' is currently in the third row and is oriented horizontally.\n\nFirst, let's identify the positions of all the cars and their orientations:\n- 'AA' is in the third row, horizontally oriented.\n- 'BBB' is in the first row, horizontally oriented.\n- 'CC' is in the second row, vertically oriented.\n- 'G' is in the third, fourth, and fifth rows, vertically oriented.\n- 'D' and 'E' are in the fourth and fifth rows, respectively, horizontally oriented.\n- 'H' is in the fourth and fifth rows, vertically oriented.\n- 'F' is in the sixth row, horizontally oriented.\n- 'I' is in the first, second, and third columns, vertically oriented.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the possible moves for 'AA'. 'AA' needs to move to the right to reach the exit. However, it is blocked by 'I'. So, the first step is to move 'I' out of the way.\n\n1. Move 'I' up. Since 'I' spans across three rows, we need to move it up three times to clear the third row where 'AA' is. However, 'I' is blocked by 'x' at the top, so we can't move it up directly from its current position.\n\nLet's start solving:\n- 'CC' is blocking the path for 'I' to move up directly from its current position in the second row, but 'CC' can move up or down.

'I' is vertical, so it can move up or down.\n   - 'I' is present in the first, second, and third rows. We need to move it out of the way of 'AA', which is in the third row.\n   - To move 'I', we first check if there's any obstruction. 'I' can move up since there's no car blocking it from the top; it's blocked by 'x' in the first row but can still move down.\n\n4. **Moving 'I':**\n   - 'I' can be moved up or down. Since 'I' is in three rows, we need to move it in a way that clears the path for 'AA'. Let's move 'I' up.\n\n5. **Initial Moves:**\n   - To move 'I' up, we first need to check its current position and then decide. 'I' is in columns 5 and its presence is in rows 1, 2, and 3. Let's start by moving 'I' up. However, we need to analyze if 'I' can be moved up directly.\n\n6. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - Let's analyze the positions:\n     - 'I' is at (1,5), (2,5), and (3,5).\n     - To move 'I' up, we need to move it 3 steps up to clear 'AA'. However, we should start by checking the feasibility of moving other cars to facilitate 'I' or 'AA' movement.\n\n7. **Actual Moves:**\n   - Let's start:\n     - 'CC' is blocking 'I' from moving up directly because 'C' is in the second row. We need to move 'C' left to free 'I'.\n     - 'C+2' to move 'CC' left by 2 spaces.\n     - Now, 'I' can move up. 'I+3' to move 'I' up by 3 spaces (since it's vertical and can move up/down).\n     - Now 'AA' can move right. 'A+2' to move 'AA' out.\n\n8. **Calculating the Moves:**\n   - 'C+2' to clear the way for 'I'.\n   - 'I-3' (since moving up is considered negative) to move 'I' up.\n   - 'A+2' to move 'AA' to the exit.\n\n9. **Other Necessary Moves:**\n   - Before 'C+2', we need to ensure 'B' doesn't block 'C'. 'B' is fixed due to 'x', so 'B' can't move left or right significantly, but we need to check the lower cars.\n   - 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H' need to be analyzed for potential moves that could be necessary.\n\n10. **Detailed Analysis and Moves:**\n    - Upon closer inspection, we see that 'F' is blocking 'C' from moving left directly because 'F' is below 'C' and 'C' is horizontal. So, we need to move 'F' down or 'C' needs a clear path.\n    - 'F-1' to move 'F' down.\n\nLet's put it all together with the necessary moves:\n- 'F-1' to move 'F' down.\n- 'C+2' to move 'C' right is not possible due to 'I', so we actually need 'C+2' after 'I' is moved.\n- 'I-3' to move 'I' up.\n- 'A+2' to move 'AA' right.\n\nSo, the sequence is: 'F-1 C+2 I-3 A+2'.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>F-1 I-3 C+2 A+2</answer>",

'A' is 'IAA..', so 'A+2' to move it out.\n\nLet's detail the steps with the required format:\n\n1. **Move 'E' down:** `E+1`\n   - Before: `IEEE.L`\n   - After: `I..E.L` (Assuming it moves down one step, actual board state isn't shown here but it's a hypothetical step)\n\n2. **Move 'L' up:** Since 'L' spans across 3 rows and we need to move it up to get it out of 'A's way, `L-2`.\n\n3. **Move 'A' right:** Once 'L' is moved, 'A' can be moved. `A+2` or more as needed until it exits.\n\nLet's execute the steps with the correct analysis:\n\n1. `E+1` (Move 'E' down)\n   - Board changes: \n     ```\n     H.BBCC\n     HDD..L\n     IAA..L\n     I..E.L\n     FFJKGG\n     ..JK..\n     ```\n\n2. `L-2` (Move 'L' up)\n   - Before: \n     ```\n     HDD..L\n     IAA..L\n     I..E.L\n     ```\n   - After: \n     ```\n     HDD... \n     IAA....\n     I..E.L \n     ```\n\n   Actual board after `L-2`:\n     ```\n     H.BBCC\n     HDD...\n     IAA...\n     I..E.L\n     FFJKGG\n     ..JK..\n     ```\n\n3. `A+3` to move 'A' to the exit.\n\nOther cars need to be moved to facilitate the movement of 'E', 'L', and 'A'. Let's directly formulate the sequence:\n\n1. `D-1` to free 'H' or adjust other cars.\n2. `C-2` to free 'B'.\n3. Adjust 'F', 'J', 'K', 'G' as necessary.\n\nLet's directly analyze and provide a simplified sequence focusing on 'A' and its immediate blockers.\n\nThe sequence involves several steps including moving 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'J', 'K', 'G', 'L', and 'H' to free 'A'. Let's directly provide the final sequence after detailed analysis.\n\nAfter analyzing and simplifying:\nThe final sequence is: `C-2 F+2 E+1 L-2 D-1 A+3`\n\nLet's put it in the required format:\n<answer>C-2 F+2 E+1 L-2 D-1 A+3</answer>",

To move 'AA' out, 'L' needs to be moved.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Movement:**\n   - First, let's move 'L' to clear the path for 'AA'. 'L' is on the third and second rows. We can move 'L' down by moving the instances of 'L' appropriately.\n   - 'L' on the second row is blocking the 'L' on the third row from moving down directly. We need to move the top 'L' first.\n\nLet's start moving vehicles:\n- Move 'L' (on the second row) right: `L+1`\n  - Before: `HDD..L`, `IAA..L`, becomes `HDD...`, `IAAL.L`\n  - After moving 'L' on the second row to the right: `HDD...L`, `IAA.LL`\n- Correct the understanding of 'L' movement: The actual move should directly address the 'L' on the third row. To do that, we need to understand 'L' is on the 2nd and 3rd row. Let's directly analyze the moves required.\n\n1. `L+1` (Move 'L' right on the 2nd row, but it's actually not directly possible due to its current position and the presence of other cars. Let's directly analyze the grid and plan the moves.)\n\nLet's directly plan the moves:\n- The 'L' is vertical and on the 2nd and 3rd row. To move it, we actually need to consider its current position and the fact that it's blocked by other cars or itself being vertical and needing to be moved down or up.\n\nLet's directly analyze and provide the sequence:\n1. Move 'C' right: `C+2` (`C` is on the first row and can be moved right as it's horizontal)\n2. Move 'B' right: `B+2`\n3. The grid becomes: `H..CC`, `HDD..L`, `IAA..L`, `IEEE.L`, `FFJKGG`, `..JK..`\n4. Now, let's focus on 'L': Move 'L' down: This requires understanding that 'L' is vertical. To move 'L' down, the top 'L' needs to be moved down. So, `L-1` is not possible directly as 'L' is vertical and we need to move the top part down, but we actually need to consider moving the entire 'L' down by one, which involves understanding its vertical orientation.\n\nLet's simplify and directly give the moves:\n1. `C+2`\n2. `B+2`\n3. `H-2` (To move 'H' up and potentially free some space or adjust)\n4. `L+1` is not directly feasible due to its orientation and position. We actually need to free 'L' or move it. Let's directly plan for 'AA'.\n\nTo move 'AA' out, let's directly analyze the required steps and simplify:\n- `F-1` (Move 'F' left to potentially free 'J' or 'K')\n- `K+1` (If 'K' can be moved)\n- The actual sequence involves understanding the interdependence of the cars.\n\nLet's directly provide a feasible sequence:\n1. `C+2`\n2. `B+2`\n3. `H-2`\n4. `F-1`\n5. `K+1`\n6. `J+1` (If 'J' can be moved right)\n7. `L-1` (Move 'L' up, this is not directly possible as 'L' is vertical and we need the top part to move)\n\nLet's re-evaluate and simplify:\nThe actual moves are complex and require a detailed step-by-step analysis.

It is blocked by other cars and needs a path to be cleared to move to the right.\n\n2. **First Step**: Let's identify the cars that are blocking the red car (AA) directly or indirectly. The red car is on the third row, and there's a car (L) on the same row to its right. To move AA to the right, we need to clear or move L.\n\n3. **Analyzing L**: L is a vertical car spanning across the second, third, and fourth rows. To move L, we need to move it up or down since it's oriented vertically.\n\n4. **Clearing the Path for L**: \n   - To move L down, we need to check if there's space below it. The fifth row has '.' (empty space) under L, and the sixth row also has '.' under L on the third and fourth columns. So, L can be moved down.\n   - Before moving L, let's check if there's any constraint. The fourth row has 'E' to the left of L, and 'E' is also on the fifth row. 'E' is a horizontal car, so it can move left or right.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Moves**:\n   - First, let's move 'E' to the left to potentially free up some space or adjust the configuration: `E-1`.\n   - Current board state after `E-1` is considered:\n   ```\n   H.BBCC\n   HDD..L\n   IAA..L\n   IDD.E.L (after E-1, 'I' remains the same, 'D' moves to the left)\n   I becomes:  IEEE.L -> ID.E.L (Not a valid move directly, actual move is E-1)\n   Actual state after E-1: \n   H.BBCC\n   HDD..L\n   IAA..L\n   ID.E.L\n   FFJKGG\n   ..JK..\n   ```\n   - Let's directly analyze the moves now.\n\nLet's directly plan the moves:\n1.

It's on the fourth row, and there's space to its right.\n\n7. **Detailed Moves**:\n   - Let's start with 'C'. 'C' can move right because 'K' is to its right and there's space after 'K'. So, 'C+1'.\n   - 'K' is vertical, so it can move up or down. 'K' needs to move down to allow 'C' to move further right. So, 'K+1'.\n   - Now 'C' can move further right. 'C+1'.\n   - 'I' can move right now because 'J' has space to move down. 'I+1'.\n   - 'J' can move down. 'J+1'.\n   - 'AA' can now move right. 'A+1' (since 'AA' is a single unit for movement purposes, we just use 'A').\n\n8. **Continuing the Moves for 'AA' to Exit**:\n   - After 'J' moves down, 'AA' can move right. So, 'A+2' to directly exit.\n\nLet's simplify and directly specify the moves required to achieve the task.\n\n1. Move 'C' right: 'C+1'\n2. Move 'K' down: 'K+1'\n3. Move 'C' right again: 'C+1'\n4. Move 'I' right: 'I+1'\n5. Move 'J' down: 'J+1'\n6. Move 'A' right: 'A+2'\n\nSo, the sequence is: 'C+1 K+1 C+1 I+1 J+1 A+2'\n\n<answer>C+1 K+1 C+1 I+1 J+1 A+2</answer>",

The initial state of the board is:\n```\nBBCC.x\n.DDEEL\n.AA..L\nxFFK..\nI.JKGG\nI.JHH.\n```\n\n2. First, let's identify the positions and orientations of the cars and the wall:\n- AA (red car) is horizontal and needs to move right.\n- BB is horizontal.\n- CC is horizontal.\n- DD is vertical.\n- EE is horizontal.\n- FF is vertical.\n- II is vertical.\n- JJ is vertical.\n- KK is horizontal.\n- GG is horizontal.\n- HH is horizontal.\n- LL is vertical.\n\n3.

To move 'L', we need to create space for it to move.\n   - 'L' can move down into the third row, but 'M' is below it and is also oriented vertically. 'M' needs to be moved down to make space for 'L'.\n   - To move 'M' down, we need to check its current position and the space below it. 'M' is in the fourth and fifth rows. In the fourth row, 'M' is blocked by 'x', but in the fifth row, it can potentially move down if there's space.\n   - Let's start by examining 'M'. 'M' is in the 4th and 5th rows.

'M' can move down into the 6th row because there's '.' available.\n\n5. **Moves**:\n   - Move 'M' down: `M+1`\n   - Now 'L' can move down: `L+1`\n   - 'AA' can move right: `A+1`\n   - Since 'AA' was initially two units long and is now at the third row, third and fourth columns, moving it one step to the right will place it at the fourth and fifth columns. It needs to move further to the exit.\n\nLet's continue the step-by-step process:\n\n1. `M+1` (Move 'M' down)\n   - Before: \n     ```\n     BBBKCC\n     DDJK.L\n     I.JAAL\n     IEE.xM\n     FF...M\n     GG.xHH\n     ```\n   - After: \n     ```\n     BBBKCC\n     DDJK.L\n     I.JAAL\n     IEE.x.\n     FF..MM\n     GG.xHH\n     ```\n\n2. `L+1` (Move 'L' down)\n   - Before: \n     ```\n     BBBKCC\n     DDJK.L\n     I.JAAL\n     IEE.x.\n     FF..MM\n     GG.xHH\n     ```\n   - After: \n     ```\n     BBBKCC\n     DDJKL.\n     I.JAA.\n     IEE.x.\n     FF..MM\n     GG.xHH\n     ```\n\n3. `A+2` (Move 'AA' right)\n   - Before: \n     ```\n     BBBKCC\n     DDJKL.\n     I.JAA.\n     IEE.x.\n     FF..MM\n     GG.xHH\n     ```\n   - After: \n     ```\n     BBBKCC\n     DDJKL.\n     I.J.AA\n     IEE.x.\n     FF..MM\n     GG.xHH\n     ```\n\nLet's directly provide the sequence of moves to achieve the goal.\n\nTo simplify, let's directly analyze and provide the required moves.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n1. `M+1`\n2. `L+1`\n3. `A+2`\n\nThe final sequence in the required format is: `M+1 L+1 A+2`\n\n<answer>M+1 L+1 A+2</answer>",

The initial state of the board is:\n\n```\nBBBKCC\nDDJK.L\nI.JAAL\nIEE.xM\nFF...M\nGG.xHH\n```\n\nFirst, let's identify the positions and orientations of the cars and other relevant elements:\n- 'AA' is a horizontal car, so it can move left or right.\n- The exit is on the right side, so 'AA' needs to move right to exit.\n\nLet's start by examining 'AA's current position and the surrounding cars:\n- 'AA' is on the third row, and its rightmost end is under 'L', which means it is not yet at the exit.\n- To move 'AA' to the right, we need to clear the path by moving other cars if necessary.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\n1. 'AA' is blocked by 'L' on the right. 'L' is a vertical car, so it needs to be moved up or down to clear the path for 'AA'.\n2. 'L' is currently at the third row. To move 'L', we need to check its top and bottom. 'L' is between 'J' (which is to its left and top-left) and 'M' (which is below it). 'L' can move up or down. Since 'J' is to the left and above 'L', and there's another 'J' below it but 'M' is to its right and below, we should check the path for 'L' to move.\n3. 'L' can move down because there's a '.' below it on the fourth row, and 'M' can potentially move to make space.\n\nLet's start moving cars:\n- 'M' is a horizontal car on the fourth and fifth rows. To allow 'L' to move down, we need to check 'M's position. On the fourth row, 'M' is blocked by 'x', so it can't move left on that row. On the fifth row, 'M' can move right because there's a '.' to its right.\n- Move 'M' on the fifth row to the right: M+1.\n\nLet's analyze and continue:\nAfter analyzing the initial moves, we need to start specifying the moves.\n\n1. Move 'M' to the right to potentially free up space or make subsequent moves easier: M+1.\n2. Since 'L' is vertical and can move down, and there's space below it after 'M' moves, we can move 'L' down: L+1.\n3. Now 'AA' can move right because 'L' has moved down: A+2 (since it needs to move past 'L's original position and potentially other cars if they were in the way, but 'L' has moved).\n\nLet's continue this process and directly provide the sequence of moves required to solve the puzzle.\n\nAfter detailed analysis, the sequence of moves is derived as follows:\nThe initial step involves understanding that 'BB', 'DD', 'FF', 'GG', 'II', 'EE', 'K', 'C', 'H' need to be rearranged to let 'AA' out.\n\nThe solution involves multiple steps:\n- Move 'K' left: K-1.\n- Move 'B' left: B-3.\n- Move 'C' left: C-3.\n- Move 'D' up: D-1.\n- Move 'E' down: E+2.\n- Move 'F' down: F+2.\n- Move 'G' down: G+2.\n- Move 'I' down: I+1.\n- Move 'J' up: J-2.\n- Move 'L' down: L+1.\n- Move 'M' right: M+1.\n- Move 'A' right: A+2.\n\nCombining these into the required format: K-1 B-3 C-3 D-1 E+2 F+2 G+2 I+1 J-2 L+1 M+1 A+2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>K-1 B-3 C-3 D-1 E+2 F+2 G+2 I+1 J-2 L+1 M+1 A+2</answer>",

'I' is vertical, so it can move up or down.\n   - 'I' is currently at the third row, fourth column. To move 'AA' right, we need to move 'I' either up or down.\n   - Let's examine 'I's movement.

Since 'B' is in the way if 'H' tries to move up, and there's an 'x' (wall) below 'H', 'H' can actually move up into 'B's position if 'B' moves.\n   - 'B' is horizontal and can move left or right. 'B' is at (0,0) with a length of 2. 'B' can move right, so `B+1` or `B+2` are possible if it doesn't hit anything. Let's start by moving 'B' right: `B+2`.\n\nLet's start solving:\n- `B+2` moves 'B' to the right, making space for 'H'.\n- Then, `H+1` or `H-1` can be considered.

'F' is directly to the right of 'AA' and is also present below 'AA'. 'F' is part of a vertical car ('DF') and can be moved up or down. Moving 'F' down will help clear 'AA's path.\n   - 'G' and 'H' and 'I' are also on the same row as 'AA', and 'G' is to the right of 'F'. 'G' is part of a horizontal car and can be moved left or right.

The initial step involves moving 'F' down (`F+1`).\n2. Then, 'C' needs to be moved left (`C-2`) to allow 'F' to move further down or to create space.\n3. 'H' can move left (`H-2`), allowing 'G' to potentially move.\n4. Detailed step-by-step analysis shows that multiple moves are needed to free 'AA'.\n\nDirect calculation:\n- `C-2` to move 'C' out of the way.\n- `H-2` to move 'H'.\n- `F+1` to move 'F' down.\n- `D+1` or other necessary moves to free the path for 'AA'.\n\nLet's directly solve:\n1. `C-2`\n2. `H-2`\n3. `F+1`\n4. `G-1` (to adjust 'G' and potentially 'D' and 'I')\n5. `D+1` (to adjust 'D')\n\nAfter these moves, 'AA' can potentially move.\n\nLet's simplify and directly give the required moves:\n`C-2 H-2 F+1 G-1 D+1 A+4`\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>C-2 H-2 F+1 G-1 D+1 A+4</answer>",

To do this, we need to move 'I' and 'J'.\n   - 'I' is blocking 'AA', so we need to move 'I' up or down. Since 'C' is to the left of 'I' and is vertically oriented, and there's no immediate blockage above 'I', we can move 'I' up.\n   - To move 'I' up, we first need to create space for 'C' to move since 'C' is blocking 'I's upward movement. 'C' can move up or down. Let's move 'C' down.\n\nLet's start specifying the moves:\n- Move 'C' down by 1: `C+1`\n- Now 'I' can move up by 1 (since 'C' has moved down, making space for 'I' to move up): `I-1`\n- 'J' is still blocking 'AA'. 'J' can move left or right. Since 'AA' needs to move right, 'J' needs to move left to clear the path. 'J' can move left: `J-2` (it needs to move 2 spaces to be out of 'AA's way).\n\nCurrent State after these moves:\n- `C+1`\n- `I-1`\n- `J-2`\n\nLet's analyze further:\n- After `C+1`, `I-1`, and `J-2`, the board will have 'I' moved up, and 'J' moved left, clearing the path for 'AA' to potentially move right.\n\nLet's execute the moves and see the state:\n1. `C+1`: \n   ```\n   ..HBBB\n   ..H.CC\n   .AAIJK\n   .GDDJK\n   .GEEJL\n   FF...L\n   ```\n2. `I-1`:\n   ```\n   ..HBBB\n   ..HI.CC\n   .AAIJK\n   .GDDJK\n   .GEEJL\n   FF...L\n   ```\n   Correcting the understanding: After `C+1`, 'I' moves up into the space vacated by 'C', so `I-1` is valid.\n3. `J-2`:\n   - Before `J-2`, let's correctly analyze the position after `I-1`. 'J' is still to the right of 'AA'. Let's directly apply `J-2`.\n\nThe corrected sequence and further moves:\n1. `C+1`\n2. `I-1`\n3. `J-2`\n4. Now 'AA' can move right. It needs to move 3 spaces to the right to exit: `A+3`\n\nOther necessary moves to facilitate the above steps or subsequent steps might be required, such as moving 'F', 'G', 'H', 'D', 'E', 'L' to create a path or to accommodate other cars' movements.\n\nLet's directly calculate the necessary moves:\n- `C+1`\n- `I-1`\n- `J-2`\n- To move 'AA' right, we need to ensure 'J' is out of the way, which is done by `J-2`.\n- `A+3` to move 'AA' to the exit.\n\nHowever, let's re-examine the initial steps and directly provide a feasible sequence of moves.\n\nUpon a detailed examination, a possible sequence is:\n- `C+1`\n- `I-1`\n- `J-2`\n- `D+1` (to move 'D' right, making 'E' able to move)\n- `E+1` (since 'D' has moved, 'E' can now move right)\n- `L+1` (to make space for 'E' and 'J')\n- `G-1` (to make space for 'F' to potentially move, though 'F' isn't directly in 'AA's path)\n- `F+1` (though not directly necessary for 'AA', let's focus on 'AA's path)\n- `A+3`\n\nLet's directly simplify and provide the final sequence:\n`C+1 I-1 D+1 E+1 J-2 L+1 A+3`\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>C+1 I-1 D+1 E+1 J-2 L+1 A+3</answer>",

It is blocked by the 'K' and 'L' cars on its right side and potentially by other cars or walls on its left side.\n\n3. First, we need to identify the cars that are blocking the red car's path and figure out how to move them out of the way.\n\n4. Looking at the board:\n- 'K' and 'L' are on the right side of 'AA'. 'K' is vertical and can be moved up or down. 'L' is horizontal and can be moved left or right.\n- 'K' is blocked by 'x' (wall) at the top, so it can't move up. It can move down.\n- 'L' is currently blocking 'AA' from moving right. To move 'L' right, we need to clear its right path.\n\n5. Let's analyze the positions and possible moves:\n- 'L' is on the second and third rows. To move 'L' right, we need to ensure there's space. Since 'L' is on the third row with 'AA' and also on the second row, we should first check if we can move it.\n- 'F' and 'C' are on the first and second rows and are not directly blocking 'L' from moving right on the third row, but 'F' is below 'L' on the third row isn't directly blocked by 'F', 'F' is below 'E' and 'L' is to the right of 'E' and 'F'. 'L' can potentially move right if we clear the way.\n\n6. Let's start by moving 'L' down to free 'AA'. 'L' is on the second and third rows. To move 'L' down, we need to check if there's space below it on the third row where 'AA' is. 'L' on the third row can be moved right if 'L' on the second row moves down.\n\n7. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n- Move 'L' down. To do this, we first need to ensure 'L' can move down. 'L' is on the 2nd and 3rd row. We need to move the 'L' on the 2nd row down.\n\nLet's begin with the actual moves based on the analysis:\n\n1. Move 'K' down to free 'L': `K+1`\n2. Now 'L' can move right: `L+2` (since it can move 2 spaces to the right as there are no more 'L's and it's not blocked by other cars or walls directly on its right on the 3rd row, but we actually need to consider its current position and the fact that it is 3 units long).\n   \nLet's directly analyze and specify the moves.\n\n1. `K+1` (Move 'K' down)\n2. `L+2` (Move 'L' right, after 'K' is moved down)\n\nAfter `K+1` and `L+2`, 'AA' can move right.\n\n3. `AA+2` (Move 'AA' to the right, as 'L' has moved out of the way)\n\nOther cars need to be moved to enable these moves.\n\nLet's directly calculate the moves:\n- To move 'K' down: `K+1`\n- 'L' is 3 units long and is on the 2nd and 3rd row. To free 'L', we need to ensure it can move. After `K+1`, `L+2`.\n- 'AA' can then move right: `AA+2` is not possible directly without checking other cars.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the moves step by step with the correct analysis:\n1. `K+1` to move 'K' down.\n2. Before moving 'L', let's check its position and other cars. 'L' is on the 2nd and 3rd rows. To move 'L', we should check if we need to move other cars like 'F'.\n\nTo simplify, let's directly give the moves required after analyzing the grid.\n\nThe correct sequence involves moving several cars. Let's directly specify the moves.\n\nThe final sequence is:\n`K+1 L+2 F-1 E-1 I+1 AA+4`\n\nLet's put it in the required format:\n<answer>F-1 E-1 K+1 L+2 I+1 AA+4</answer> is not directly derived from the above step-by-step due to simplification; however, the exact step-by-step derivation for the given format is complex and involves understanding the relative positions and movements.\n\n<answer>F-1 E-1 K+1 L+2 I+1 AA+4</answer>",

'AA' is horizontally oriented, so it can move left or right.\n2. 'AA' is blocked by 'I' and 'J' on its right.\n\nTo move 'AA' to the right, we need to clear the path by moving 'I' and 'J' out of the way.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the positions of 'I' and 'J':\n\n- 'I' and 'J' are vertically oriented, so they can move up or down.\n- 'I' is at the second and third rows, so it can move up or down.\n- 'J' is also at the second and third rows, so it can move up or down.\n\nTo clear the path for 'AA', we need to move 'I' and 'J'. \n\n1. Move 'I' down: Since 'I' is at rows 1 and 2 (0-indexed), moving it down will place it at rows 2 and 3. However, 'I' is already at row 2 and 3 (1 and 2, 0-indexed for the relevant 'I'), so we need to move it further down. 'I-1' (down by 1) is a valid move because there's space below.\n\nLet's start with 'I-1':\n- 'I' moves down: `I-1`\n\n2. After 'I-1', 'I' is out of the way for 'J'. Now, let's move 'J' down: `J-1`\n\n3. With 'I' and 'J' moved down, 'AA' can now move right. The initial position of 'AA' is column 0 and 1 (0-indexed), so it needs to move to the right until it exits.\n\nLet's move 'AA' to the right: `AA+4` (since it needs to move from column 0-1 to column 4-5).\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that 'D' and 'K' are not in the way.\n\nLet's analyze the moves step by step and specify them in the required format.\n\n1. `I-1` to move 'I' down.\n2. `J-1` to move 'J' down.\n3. Before moving 'AA', we need to check if 'D' is in the way. 'D' is horizontally oriented and can move left or right. We need to move 'D' to the left to give space to 'AA'. `D-2` will move 'D' out of the way.\n4. Now, 'AA' can move right: `AA+4`.\n\nLet's specify the moves:\n\n1. Move 'D' left: `D-2`\n2. Move 'I' down: `I-1`\n3. Move 'J' down: `J-1`\n4. Move 'AA' right: `AA+4`\n\nThe sequence is: `D-2 I-1 J-1 AA+4`\n\n<answer>D-2 I-1 J-1 AA+4</answer>",

'N' can move down as there's space available.\n   - `N+1` is the first move to free 'AA'.\n\n3. **Subsequent Moves**:\n   - After `N+1`, 'AA' is free to move right, so `A+1`.\n\nLet's analyze and write down the steps in detail:\n\n1. `N+1` to move 'N' down.\n2. `A+1` to move 'AA' to the right.\n\nBefore executing `N+1`, let's check if 'N' can actually move down without any obstruction. 'N' is on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th rows. On the 4th row, 'N' is at the 5th column. Below 'N', on the 4th row, there's a '.' (empty space), so 'N' can move down.\n\nLet's now detail the moves:\n- `N+1` (Move 'N' down by 1)\n- `A+1` (Move 'AA' right by 1)\n\nLet's verify if there are any other necessary moves:\n- 'J' and 'K' are blocking the path for 'N' to move down further if needed, but 'N' only needs to move down once.\n- 'J' and 'K' are vertically oriented and can move up or down. However, their movement isn't directly necessary for 'AA' to exit.\n\nThe required moves are:\n1. `N+1`\n2. `A+1`\n\nSo, the solution is: `N+1 A+1`\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>N+1 A+1</answer>",

The red car is 'AA', which is oriented horizontally.\n2. The task is to move 'AA' to the exit on the right.\n\nLet's analyze the position and the possible moves:\n\n1. 'AA' is blocked by 'N' on the right. So, 'N' needs to be moved to allow 'AA' to exit.\n2. 'N' is oriented vertically, so it can move up or down.\n3. To free 'AA', 'N' needs to move down since there's no space for it to move up due to the presence of 'LM' and the wall-like structure formed by other cars.\n\nLet's start solving:\n\n1. The initial position of 'N' is at the 3rd row. It needs to move down to allow 'AA' to exit.\n2. To move 'N' down, we need to clear the path for it.\n\nLet's start making moves:\n\n1. 'N' is at the 3rd row. To move it down, we need to check its current column and the cars around it. 'N' is in the 5th column.\n   \nFirst, let's identify the cars and their orientations:\n- 'G' is vertical.\n- 'B' is horizontal.\n- 'H' is vertical.\n- 'I' is vertical.\n- 'AA' is horizontal.\n- 'C' is vertical.\n- 'J' is vertical.\n- 'K' is vertical.\n- 'N' is vertical.\n- 'D' is horizontal.\n- 'E' is vertical.\n- 'F' is horizontal.\n- 'L' is horizontal.\n- 'M' is horizontal.\n\nLet's start with 'N'. 'N' can move down if the space below it is clear. Currently, '.' is below it in the 4th row, and 'D' is below it in the 5th row. So, 'N' can move down.\n\nLet's analyze and make the necessary moves step by step.\n\n1. Move 'N' down: `N+1`\n   \nCurrent board after understanding the task doesn't directly give us the sequence. Let's analyze further.\n\nThe sequence involves understanding that 'D' is blocking 'N' from moving further down directly. So, we need to adjust 'D' and other cars to facilitate 'N' moving down and then 'AA' moving out.\n\nLet's directly analyze the moves required:\n1. 'D' needs to move right to allow 'N' to move down: `D+1`\n2. 'N' moves down: `N+1`\n3. 'AA' can now move right: `A+2`\n\nHowever, let's directly figure out the steps needed to achieve this.\n\nTo simplify, here's a step-by-step thought:\n- 'D+1' to move 'D' right, making space for 'N' to move down.\n- 'N+1' to move 'N' down.\n- Then 'A+2' to move 'AA' to the exit.\n\nOther cars need to be moved to facilitate these moves.\n\nLet's directly identify the moves:\n1. `F+1` to move 'F' right (initial step to free 'D').\n2. `D+1` to move 'D' right.\n3. `K-1` to move 'K' up (to allow 'J' to move).\n4. `J-1` to move 'J' up (since 'K' moved up).\n5. `N+1` to move 'N' down.\n6. `A+2` to move 'AA' out.\n\nSo, the sequence is: `F+1 D+1 K-1 J-1 N+1 A+2`\n\n<answer>F+1 D+1 K-1 J-1 N+1 A+2</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this, let's analyze the given board and the task step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Board State:**\n   - The given board is:\n     ```\n     GBB.LM\n     GHI.LM\n     GHIAAN\n     CCJK.N\n     ..JKDD\n     .EEFF.\n     ```\n   - The red car is 'AA', which is oriented horizontally.\n\n2. **Understanding the Task:**\n   - We need to move 'AA' to the exit on the right. 'AA' is currently in the third row.\n   - The exit is off the right edge of the grid, so 'AA' needs to be moved to the rightmost position in its row.\n\n3. **Analyzing 'AA's Movement:**\n   - 'AA' is in the third row and is blocked by 'N' on the right. So, 'N' needs to be moved to allow 'AA' to exit.\n   - 'N' is oriented vertically and is currently spanning across the third and fourth rows.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Movement:**\n   - First, we need to move 'N' up or down to clear the path for 'AA'. 'N' can move up or down because it's vertical.\n   - 'N' is currently at the third and fourth rows. To move it, we check its top and bottom. The top is blocked by 'I' and 'A', but it can potentially move down if the space below it is clear or becomes clear.\n   - Let's start by examining the vehicles around 'N' and 'AA'.\n\n5. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - 'N' is blocked from moving up by 'A'. So, we first need to analyze if 'N' can move down.\n   - To check if 'N' can move down, we see that in the fourth row, 'N' is alongside 'J' and 'K', and below 'N' in the fifth row, there's '.' (empty space). So, 'N' can move down.\n   - Move 'N' down by 1: `N+1`\n   - Now, 'AA' can potentially move right. However, we need to check if there's any blockage.\n   - After 'N' moves down, 'AA' is still blocked by other vehicles or the wall is not directly adjacent, so we check the path. 'AA' can move right now because 'N' has moved down.\n\nLet's analyze and specify the moves:\n1. Move 'N' down: `N+1`\n2. Then, 'AA' can move right. It's currently at the third column (0-indexed), so it needs to move right until it reaches the exit.\n\nLet's execute:\n- `N+1` (Move 'N' down)\n- The state becomes:\n  ```\n  GBB.LM\n  GHI.LM\n  GHIAA.\n  CCJKN.\n  ..JKD.\n  .EEFFD\n  ```\n  Corrected to reflect actual movement:\n  ```\n  GBB.LM\n  GHI.LM\n  GHIAAN\n  CCJK.N\n  ..JKDD\n  .EEFF.\n  ```\n  Becomes after `N+1`:\n  ```\n  GBB.LM\n  GHI.LM\n  GHIAA.\n  CCJKN.\n  ..JKD.\n  .EEFFD\n  ```\n  Actually, the correct next state should be analyzed based on the original grid.\n\nAfter `N+1`, 'AA' can move. Let's directly analyze the necessary moves.\n\n1. `N+1`\n2. `AA+2` (Since 'AA' can now move right and needs to move 2 spaces to the right edge)\n\nOther cars may need to move to allow 'N' or 'AA' to move or to clear the path. Let's directly analyze:\n- 'J' and 'K' are blocking 'N' from moving further down directly, but 'N' can move down once. We need to clear 'J' and 'K'.\n- 'J' and 'K' are vertical and can move up or down. 'J' and 'K' are blocked at the top by 'H' and 'I', so they can potentially move down.\n\nLet's directly specify the necessary moves based on the initial analysis and adjust as necessary.\n\nTo simplify:\n1. Move 'J' and 'K' down to free 'N': `J+1 K+1`\n2. Then, 'N' can move down: `N+1`\n3. Now, 'AA' can move right: `AA+2`\n\nSo, the moves are: `J+1 K+1 N+1 AA+2`\n\nLet's verify and directly provide the final sequence.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>J+1 K+1 N+1 AA+2</answer>",
