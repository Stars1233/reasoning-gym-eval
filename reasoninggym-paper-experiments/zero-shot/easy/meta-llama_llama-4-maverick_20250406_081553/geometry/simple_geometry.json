So, (6-2) * 180 = 4 * 180 = 720.\n\n## Step 3: Sum the given interior angles.\nAdd up the measures of the first 5 interior angles: 127.0\u00b0 + 32.0\u00b0 + 42.0\u00b0 + 106.0\u00b0 + 18.0\u00b0 = 325.0\u00b0.\n\n## Step 4: Find the measure of the remaining interior angle.\nSubtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of the interior angles to find the measure of the remaining angle. So, 720 - 325 = 395.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the calculated remaining angle makes the polygon convex.\nA convex polygon has all interior angles less than 180\u00b0. The calculated remaining angle is 395\u00b0, which is greater than 180\u00b0, indicating an error in assuming the polygon is convex with the given angles. However, the task is to calculate the remaining angle based on the given information.\n\n## Step 6: Since the problem states it's a convex polygon, re-evaluate the given information.\nGiven that a convex polygon cannot have an interior angle greater than 180\u00b0, and our calculation yields 395\u00b0, which is not valid for a convex polygon, we must still proceed with the mathematical calculation as per the given problem statement.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>395</answer>",

The calculated remaining angle is 395 degrees, which is not valid for a convex polygon as it exceeds 180 degrees. This indicates a miscalculation or misunderstanding in the context of the given problem. However, following the mathematical procedure: the calculation is correct but the result is not valid for a convex polygon.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluate the calculation for the remaining angle\nGiven that the sum of all interior angles is 720 degrees and the sum of the first 5 angles is 325 degrees, the remaining angle is indeed 720 - 325 = 395 degrees. This result is mathematically correct but contradicts the premise of the polygon being convex since an angle of 395 degrees is not possible in a convex polygon.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>395</answer>",

The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by (n-2) * 180\u00b0, where n is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\nFor a polygon with 4 sides (a quadrilateral), n = 4. So, the sum of the interior angles = (4-2) * 180\u00b0 = 2 * 180\u00b0 = 360\u00b0.\n\nGiven that the measures of the first 3 interior angles are 58.0\u00b0, 148.0\u00b0, and 36.0\u00b0, we can find their sum: 58.0\u00b0 + 148.0\u00b0 + 36.0\u00b0 = 242.0\u00b0.\n\nTo find the measure of the last interior angle, we subtract the sum of the first 3 angles from the total sum of the interior angles: 360\u00b0 - 242.0\u00b0 = 118.0\u00b0.\n\n<answer>118</answer>",

Summing these angles gives \\(78.0 + 34.0 + 155.0 + 143.0 + 130.0 = 540.0^\\circ\\).\n\n## Step 4: Find the measure of the remaining interior angle\nTo find the remaining angle, subtract the sum of the given angles from the total sum of interior angles. So, the remaining angle \\(= 720^\\circ - 540.0^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>180</answer>",
