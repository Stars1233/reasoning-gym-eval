Let's start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2. However, 77 is odd, so 2 won't be a factor.\n\nMoving on to the next prime number, 3, it's not a factor because the sum of the digits of 77 (7+7 = 14) is not divisible by 3.\n\nThe next prime number is 5, but 77 doesn't end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.\n\nThe next prime number is 7. When we divide 77 by 7, we get 11, which is also a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 77 is 7 \u00d7 11.\n\n<answer>7 \u00d7 11</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To find the prime factorization of 561, let's start by checking divisibility by the smallest prime numbers.\n\n1. Checking divisibility by 2: 561 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n2. Checking divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 561 is 5 + 6 + 1 = 12, which is divisible by 3. So, 561 is divisible by 3.\n   - 561 \u00f7 3 = 187\n\n3. Checking divisibility of 187 by 3: The sum of the digits of 187 is 1 + 8 + 7 = 16, which is not divisible by 3. So, 187 is not divisible by 3.\n4. Checking divisibility by 5: 187 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.\n5. Checking divisibility by 7: 187 \u00f7 7 \u2248 26.71, which is not a whole number. So, 187 is not divisible by 7.\n6. Checking divisibility by 11: 187 \u00f7 11 = 17, which is a whole number. So, 187 is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, we have 561 = 3 \u00d7 187 = 3 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 17.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 561 is 3 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 17.\n\n<answer>3 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 17</answer>",
