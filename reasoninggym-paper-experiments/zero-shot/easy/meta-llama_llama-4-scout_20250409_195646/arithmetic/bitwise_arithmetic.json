To do this, we first need to understand that $0x3 = 3$ in decimal. Shifting $0x386e$ to the right by 3 bits is equivalent to dividing by $2^3 = 8$. So, $0x386e$ in decimal is $13966$, and $13966 / 8 = 1745.75$. However, since we're dealing with integers, we take the integer part, which is $1745$. In hexadecimal, $1745$ is $0x6d1$.\n\n## 3: Multiply the results of the shift operations\nNow, multiply the results of the two operations: $0x23e8 * 0x6d1$. First, convert both to decimal for ease of calculation. $0x23e8 = 9216$ in decimal, and $0x6d1 = 1745$ in decimal. Then, $9216 * 1745 = 16081920$.\n\n## 4: Convert the product to hexadecimal\nFinally, convert $16081920$ to hexadecimal. $16081920$ in hexadecimal is $0xf48000$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0xf48000</answer>",
