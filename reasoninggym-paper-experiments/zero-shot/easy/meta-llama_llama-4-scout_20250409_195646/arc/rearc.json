      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given examples and find a common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze Example 1\nLooking at Example 1, we notice that the output grid seems to consist mainly of 0s and 5s. Let's examine the input grid for patterns that could result in this output.\n\n## 2: Identify Patterns in Example 1\nUpon closer inspection, we see that the output grid has 5s in positions where the input grid has numbers greater than a certain threshold or specific patterns, but a clear, simple rule isn't immediately apparent without comparing to other examples.\n\n## 3: Analyze Example 2\nIn Example 2, the output grid consists mainly of 9s and 2s.

Looking closely, it seems that if there's a repetition of the same number in the input grid, especially in a pattern or a row/column, the output could be related to the count or presence of these repetitions.\n\n\n## 2: Detailed Analysis of Example 1\nUpon a detailed examination, we notice that in the input grid, there are many repetitions of the number 5. In the output grid, most cells are 1 or 5. Specifically, areas with repeated numbers in the input grid seem to map to 5 in the output, and areas with less repetition or different numbers seem to map to 1.\n\n\n## 3: Analyzing Example 2\nIn Example 2, the input grid again shows various numbers, but the output grid is simpler, with mostly 2s and 5s. Here, it seems that the rule could be related to the count of different numbers or their distribution.\n\n\n## 4: Detailed Analysis of Example 2\nLooking closely at Example 2, we see that the output grid has a lot of 5s and 2s.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this, let's analyze the given examples to find a common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid.\n\n\n## Step 1: Analyze Example 1\nIn Example 1, the input grid has two distinct values (2 and 3) separated by a band of 2s, and the output grid is entirely 2s except for a small section at the bottom that changes to 2s if it was 3s in the input.\n\n\n## 2: Analyze Example 2\nThe input grid has a clear distinction with 1s on the edges and 4s in the middle, and the output grid changes the 4s to 1s except for the very first row.\n\n\n## 3: Analyze Example 3\nHere, we see a grid with 6s and 4s, and the output grid changes all 4s to 6s.\n\n\n## 4: Analyze Example 4\nThe input grid shows 7s predominantly, with a section of 5s at the bottom, and the output changes that section to 5.\n\n\n## 5: Analyze Example 5\nThe input grid has 9s throughout with a small section of 6s at the bottom, and the output leaves the 6s as is.\n\n\n## 6: Determine the Common Rule\nFrom the examples, it seems the rule could involve changing specific numbers based on their position or neighbors. However, a clear, consistent rule across all examples seems to be that any number that appears in a \"different\" section or not part of the main grid value is changed to match the main grid value.\n\n\n## 7: Apply to Test Input\nGiven the test input:\n7 7 8 8 8 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nThe rule seems to make the grid uniform if there are sections of different numbers. For the given test input, it seems like the rule would make all numbers the same if there's a distinction.\n\n\n## 8: Conclusion\nBased on the pattern observed, if there's a predominant number and a section different from it, the rule seems to make everything the predominant number.\n\n\n## 9: Applying Rule to Test Input\nThe test input grid has 7s predominantly with a section of 8s. The rule seems to change the section of different numbers (in this case, 8) to match the rest of the grid.\n\n\n## 10: Final Output\nGiven the test input and observed rules, the output should be:\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>\n\nHowever, re-evaluating for accuracy in following the exact format required for the answer:\n\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>",

Changing it or numbers around it could be key.\n\n## 10: Specific Output Generation\nGiven the pattern, let's assume the rule makes the number next to or including the smallest number (0 in this case) change to a specific value and spread.\n\n## 11: Determining Output\nIf we follow a pattern similar to examples, the 0 could change to 4 or another specific number and spread.\n\n## 12: Generating Output Grid\nBased on observations, if 0 is a key point, it changes and spreads. Assuming a similar transformation:\n- The 0 could become a focal point for change.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 4 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>\n</end_header_id|end_header_id",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given examples to identify a pattern or rule that is applied to transform the input grid into the output grid.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\nLooking at Example 1, the main change occurs in the second row, second column where the number changes from 6 to 4, and in the last row, the 1 changes to 6 in a pattern that seems to spread or change based on specific cells.\n\n## 2: Detailed Analysis of Changes\nIn Example 1, the output changes the 6 in the input to a 4 in the second row, and then spreads or changes other numbers based on their positions and values.\n\n## 3: Identifying the Rule\nUpon closer inspection, a key observation is that the rule seems to involve changing certain numbers based on their positions and possibly the presence of specific numbers.\n\n## 4: Specific Pattern Observation\nA specific pattern can be observed:\n- In Example 1, the 6 in the input grid becomes 4 in the output grid, and then 6 spreads.\n- In Example 2, a 2 in the input becomes 4 in the output and then 6 spreads.\n- In Example 3, a 3 appears in the output where there was a change from a higher number.\n\n## 5: Generalizing the Rule\nThe rule seems to involve identifying a specific number (often lower than the surrounding numbers) and then changing it and possibly spreading it according to its position.\n\n## 6: Detailed Rule Identification\nA detailed look reveals:\n- The smallest number in the grid often changes first.\n- The change seems to spread to adjacent cells.\n\n## 7: Applying to Test Input\nGiven the test input:\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 0 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n## 8: Finding the Smallest Number and Applying Change\nThe smallest number is 0. It seems that numbers adjacent to or including the smallest number change.\n\n## 9: Applying Observed Rules\nThe number 0 seems to be a focal point. Changing it or numbers around it could be key.\n\n## 10: Specific Output Generation\nGiven the pattern, let's assume the rule makes the number next to or including the smallest number (0 in this case) change to a specific value and spread.\n\n## 11: Determining Output\nIf we follow a pattern similar to examples, the 0 could change to 4 or another specific number and spread.\n\n## 12: Generating Output Grid\nBased on observations, if 0 is a key point, it changes and spreads. Assuming a similar transformation:\n- The 0 could become a focal point for change.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 4 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>\n</end_header_id|end_header_id",

This suggests that the output grid size might be determined by the input, but it's not directly scaling. Instead, it seems to replicate the input into a larger grid.\n\n## 2: Analyzing Example 2\nThe input for Example 2 is a 3x3 grid filled with \"9\"s, and the output is a 6x6 grid filled with \"9\"s. This indicates that the output grid might be twice the size of the input grid in each dimension.\n\n## 3: Analyzing Example 3\nFor Example 3, the input is a 3x3 grid with varying numbers, and the output is an 6x6 grid where the pattern seems to be replicated and possibly rotated or mirrored in some parts. However, a closer look shows that each number in the input grid is replicated into a larger grid, seemingly following a pattern of grid expansion.\n\n## 4: Analyzing Example 4\nThe input for Example 4 is a single number \"1\", and the output is a 6x6 grid filled with \"1\"s.

However, a consistent observation is that each element in the input grid is replicated into a larger grid.

This reinforces the idea that for certain patterns, the output might simply be a copy of the input.\n\n\n## 3: Analyzing Example 3\nExample 3 again shows that the input and output grids are identical, further supporting the observation from Examples 1 and 2.\n\n\n## 4: Identifying the Rule\nGiven that in all examples provided, the output grid is exactly the same as the input grid, it seems the \"rule\" could simply be an identity function where the output is the input.\n\n\n## 5: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nIf the rule is indeed that the output grid is identical to the input grid, then we apply this directly to the test input.\n\n\n## 6: Generating the Output Grid\nThe test input grid is:\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 6 6 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 6 6 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n\nThe output grid, according to the observed rule, would be identical to the input grid.\n\n\n<answer>\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 6 6 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 6 6 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n</answer>",

However, a clear and specific rule isn't directly apparent without a more detailed analysis of how each output cell is generated from its corresponding input cell.\n\n## Detailed Rule Identification\n\n1. **Example 1**: Notice that the output grid changes the input grid by propagating or moving certain numbers (like 1) in a specific pattern.\n2. **Example 2**: The output seems to \"move\" or change the position of certain numbers (like 4 and 7) based on their proximity to other numbers.\n3. **Example 3**: The changes seem to involve moving numbers down or right based on certain conditions.\n\n## Applying Observations to Find a Precise Rule\n\nGiven the complexity and without a straightforward mathematical transformation (like a simple convolution or direct substitution), let's hypothesize that the rule might involve:\n\n- **Diffusion or Movement**: Numbers move or change based on their neighbors or position.\n\n## Test Input Grid Application\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\n## Applying the Rule\n\nBased on visual inspection and given examples, a precise algorithmic rule isn't straightforwardly derived without additional context or a clearer pattern. However, let's consider a basic form of transformation that could apply:\n\nIf we consider a basic movement or change rule based on provided examples:\n\n## Output Grid\n\n```\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\nHowever, given that a clear, specific rule wasn't directly identified through step-by-step logical deduction from the examples due to their complexity and the potential for multiple interpretations, let's assume a simpler form of transformation based on typical grid transformation puzzles:\n\nThe actual process seems to involve subtle changes that aren't directly explained through simple observations. Given this, let's assume the output based on standard transformation logic seen in such puzzles:\n\n```\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n```",

However, a clear and specific rule isn't directly apparent without a more detailed analysis of how each output cell is generated from its corresponding input cell.\n\n## Detailed Rule Identification\n\n1. **Example 1**: Notice that the output grid changes the input grid by propagating or moving certain numbers (like 1) in a specific pattern.\n2. **Example 2**: The output seems to \"move\" or change the position of certain numbers (like 4 and 7) based on their proximity to other numbers.\n3. **Example 3**: The changes seem to involve moving numbers down or right based on certain conditions.\n\n## Applying Observations to Find a Precise Rule\n\nGiven the complexity and without a straightforward mathematical transformation (like a simple convolution or direct substitution), let's hypothesize that the rule might involve:\n\n- **Diffusion or Movement**: Numbers move or change based on their neighbors or position.\n\n## Test Input Grid Application\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\n## Applying the Rule\n\nBased on visual inspection and given examples, a precise algorithmic rule isn't straightforwardly derived without additional context or a clearer pattern. However, let's consider a basic form of transformation that could apply:\n\nIf we consider a basic movement or change rule based on provided examples:\n\n## Output Grid\n\n```\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\nHowever, given that a clear, specific rule wasn't directly identified through step-by-step logical deduction from the examples due to their complexity and the potential for multiple interpretations, let's assume a simpler form of transformation based on typical grid transformation puzzles:\n\nThe actual process seems to involve subtle changes that aren't directly explained through simple observations. Given this, let's assume the output based on standard transformation logic seen in such puzzles:\n\n```\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n```",

According to the observed rule, it should change the numbers below and to the right of it in its column to 3, but that doesn't seem accurate based on previous steps. A more accurate observation shows that numbers different from the dominant grid number change the grid according to their position.\n\n\n## 6: Correct Application of Rule\nUpon re-evaluation, it seems the rule could be related to the propagation of the different number into the grid. For any number that is different from the dominant number in the grid, it affects the grid by changing numbers in its row and column to match this different number but only up to a certain point or specifically for numbers less than the dominant.\n\n\n## 7: Final Analysis\nThe actual rule from the given examples seems to be that any cell with a value different from the dominant value in its row or column will change all cells to its right and below it in that column or row to its value.\n\n\n## 8: Apply Correct Rule\nGiven the input:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n\nThe different numbers are 3 and 2. \n\n## 9: Execution of Rule\nFor 3: Changes the column.\nFor 2: Changes the row and column.\n\n\n## 10: Output Grid\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2",

      "best_full_model_response": "To find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\nIn Example 1, the input grid has a specific pattern with different numbers, but the output grid seems to replace the increased value (8) in the input grid with the surrounding value (4), effectively \"smoothing\" or replacing the anomaly.\n\n\n## 2: Analyzing Example 2\nThe input and output grids in Example 2 are identical, suggesting that if there's no anomaly or specific condition to change, the output remains the same as the input.\n\n\n## 3: Analyzing Example 3\nExample 3 shows that anomalies or specific numbers in the input grid are replaced or changed in the output grid based on their surroundings or specific rules.\n\n\n## 4: Analyzing Example 4\nIn Example 4, a similar smoothing effect is observed where a number that stands out (like 2 or 3) in the input grid is replaced by its surrounding numbers in the output grid.\n\n\n## 5: Identifying the Rule\nFrom the given examples, it seems the rule could be related to replacing an outlier value with its neighboring values. Specifically, if a cell's value is different from its immediate neighbors, it gets replaced by those neighbors.\n\n\n## 6: Applying the Rule to Test Input\nGiven the test input grid:\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 1\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 2 8 8 7 7\n8 8 5 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n\nLet's apply the observed rule:\n- The value 1, 2, and 5 are outliers.\n\n\n## 7: Detailed Application\nLooking closely, the numbers that are different from their surroundings seem to get replaced. For instance, in the third row, the 1 is surrounded by 7s and 8s, and in the output, it should be replaced by 7 or 8 (whichever is consistent with its surroundings).\n\n\n## 8: Specific Changes\n- The 1 in the input grid seems to be an outlier and gets replaced.\n- The 2 and 5 also seem like outliers.\n\n\n## 9: Execution of Rule\nApplying this logic:\n- The 1 in the third row, fifth column of the input grid is replaced by 7 (as it's surrounded by 7s and 8s).\n- The 2 in the fifth row, third column is replaced by 8 (as it's surrounded by 8s).\n- The 5 in the sixth row, third column is replaced by 8.\n\n\n## 10: Output Grid\nThe output grid, following the identified rule, would replace outliers with their neighboring values.\n\n\n## 11: Final Output\nGiven the rule seems to replace outlier numbers with the surrounding dominant number:\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n\n\n<answer>\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\nIn Example 1, the input grid has a specific pattern with different numbers, but the output grid seems to replace the increased value (8) in the input grid with the surrounding value (4), effectively \"smoothing\" or replacing the anomaly.\n\n\n## 2: Analyzing Example 2\nThe input and output grids in Example 2 are identical, suggesting that if there's no anomaly or specific condition to change, the output remains the same as the input.\n\n\n## 3: Analyzing Example 3\nExample 3 shows that anomalies or specific numbers in the input grid are replaced or changed in the output grid based on their surroundings or specific rules.\n\n\n## 4: Analyzing Example 4\nIn Example 4, a similar smoothing effect is observed where a number that stands out (like 2 or 3) in the input grid is replaced by its surrounding numbers in the output grid.\n\n\n## 5: Identifying the Rule\nFrom the given examples, it seems the rule could be related to replacing an outlier value with its neighboring values. Specifically, if a cell's value is different from its immediate neighbors, it gets replaced by those neighbors.\n\n\n## 6: Applying the Rule to Test Input\nGiven the test input grid:\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 1\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 2 8 8 7 7\n8 8 5 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n\nLet's apply the observed rule:\n- The value 1, 2, and 5 are outliers.\n\n\n## 7: Detailed Application\nLooking closely, the numbers that are different from their surroundings seem to get replaced. For instance, in the third row, the 1 is surrounded by 7s and 8s, and in the output, it should be replaced by 7 or 8 (whichever is consistent with its surroundings).\n\n\n## 8: Specific Changes\n- The 1 in the input grid seems to be an outlier and gets replaced.\n- The 2 and 5 also seem like outliers.\n\n\n## 9: Execution of Rule\nApplying this logic:\n- The 1 in the third row, fifth column of the input grid is replaced by 7 (as it's surrounded by 7s and 8s).\n- The 2 in the fifth row, third column is replaced by 8 (as it's surrounded by 8s).\n- The 5 in the sixth row, third column is replaced by 8.\n\n\n## 10: Output Grid\nThe output grid, following the identified rule, would replace outliers with their neighboring values.\n\n\n## 11: Final Output\nGiven the rule seems to replace outlier numbers with the surrounding dominant number:\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n\n\n<answer>\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n</answer>",
