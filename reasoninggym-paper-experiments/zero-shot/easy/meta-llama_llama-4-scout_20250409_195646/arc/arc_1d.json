      "best_full_model_response": "To derive the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Observe the Pattern in Examples\nLooking at the examples provided, the task is to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. \n\n## 2: Analyze Example 1\nIn Example 1, the input grid is:\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 2 0 0 0\nAnd the output grid is:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n## 3: Analyze Example 2\nIn Example 2, the input grid is:\n0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2\nAnd the output grid is:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n## 4: Analyze Example 3\nIn Example 3, the input grid is:\n0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\nAnd the output grid is:\n2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n## 5: Identify the Rule\nFrom the given examples, it seems that the output grid consists of segments of 2s, 1s, and 0s. The 2s seem to appear in the output whenever there's a non-zero value in the input grid, and they form a continuous segment in the output grid that corresponds to the non-zero segment in the input grid but with a different length or position. The 1s in the output grid seem to correspond to segments of non-zero values in the input grid but are shorter. \n\n## 6: Detailed Observation\nUpon a detailed observation, it seems that:\n- Non-zero values in the input grid are mapped to 2s in the output grid if they are not isolated (i.e., part of a group) and to 1s if they seem isolated or at the edges of groups.\n\n## 7: Refine the Rule\nHowever, a simpler and more consistent rule seems to apply:\n- Any non-zero value in the input grid seems to result in a '2' in the output grid for as long as the non-zero values persist in the input grid.\n- Isolated or specific non-zero values might result in '1's in the output, but given the output examples, it seems that primarily '2's are generated for non-zero inputs.\n\n## 8: Apply to Test Input\nGiven the test input:\n2 2 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\n## 9: Predict Output\nThe non-zero values in the test input are 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, and 2. \nFollowing the observed pattern where non-zero inputs result in '2's in the output for their duration and considering isolated or continuous non-zero values result in '2's or '1's respectively but mostly '2's for continuous segments:\nThe output seems to be a sequence of '2's for any sequence of non-zero numbers in the input and '1's or continuation of '2's based on input presence.\n\n## 10: Finalize Rule Application\nThe input grid has sequences of non-zero numbers which should map to '2's in the output grid. Given that all non-zero inputs seem to generate '2's in output grids of examples, and zeros generate zeros or '0's and '1's seem to correspond to trailing or single non-zero inputs.\n\n## 11: Derive Output\nGiven the input:\n2 2 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output, following a pattern where non-zero values in input correspond to '2's in output:\nShould result in a sequence of 2s for the non-zero values.\n\n## 12: Generate Test Output\nApplying this, we get:\n2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</answer>",

The first non-zero value appears at index 3, and the last non-zero value appears until index 9. In the output, it starts from index 1 and ends at index 9, effectively moving one step towards the center from both ends.\n   - In Example 2, the non-zero value is also 7, appearing from index 4 to 8. In the output, it starts from index 2 and ends at index 8, again moving one step towards the center from both ends.\n   - In Example 3, the non-zero value is 4, appearing from index 3 to 9. In the output, it starts from index 1 and ends at index 9.\n\n4. **Applying the Rule**:\n   - The rule appears to be that the output grid fills with the non-zero values starting one position before the first non-zero value in the input grid and ends one position after the last non-zero value in the input grid, effectively symmetrically expanding towards the center.\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the observed rule:\n\n- The first non-zero value in the input grid is at index 2 (considering 0-based indexing), and the last non-zero value is at index 2 as well.\n- According to the pattern, the output should start filling from one position before the first non-zero value (which is index 1) and end one position after the last non-zero value (which would be index 2 + 1 = 3, but since there is only one non-zero value, it simply gets expanded).\n\nThe predicted output grid would thus fill from index 1 to index 3 with the value 3.\n\n<answer>\n0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n</end_header_id|end_header_id",

The first non-zero value appears at index 3, and the last non-zero value appears until index 9. In the output, it starts from index 1 and ends at index 9, effectively moving one step towards the center from both ends.\n   - In Example 2, the non-zero value is also 7, appearing from index 4 to 8. In the output, it starts from index 2 and ends at index 8, again moving one step towards the center from both ends.\n   - In Example 3, the non-zero value is 4, appearing from index 3 to 9. In the output, it starts from index 1 and ends at index 9.\n\n4. **Applying the Rule**:\n   - The rule appears to be that the output grid fills with the non-zero values starting one position before the first non-zero value in the input grid and ends one position after the last non-zero value in the input grid, effectively symmetrically expanding towards the center.\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the observed rule:\n\n- The first non-zero value in the input grid is at index 2 (considering 0-based indexing), and the last non-zero value is at index 2 as well.\n- According to the pattern, the output should start filling from one position before the first non-zero value (which is index 1) and end one position after the last non-zero value (which would be index 2 + 1 = 3, but since there is only one non-zero value, it simply gets expanded).\n\nThe predicted output grid would thus fill from index 1 to index 3 with the value 3.\n\n<answer>\n0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n</end_header_id|end_header_id",

Continuing this way: \n- The 2 stays as 2.\n- The 3 stays as 3.\n- The 4 shifts one place to the left but is blocked by the 2, so it stays.\n- The 1 shifts left past the 4.\n- The 2 shifts left past the 1 and 4.\n- The 9 shifts left past the 2, 1, and 4.\n- The 7 shifts left past the 9.\n- The 1 shifts left past the 7 and 9.\n- The 5 shifts left past the 1, 7, and 9.\n- The 3 shifts left past the 5, 1, 7, and 9.\n- The 6 shifts left past the 3, 5, 1, 7, and 9.\n\nSo applying this rule:\nThe output grid should have its non-zero values shifted left as far as possible.\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0\n</answer>\n</end_header_id|end_header_id>\n\nHowever, applying a more accurate interpretation based on previous steps and ensuring clarity:\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0\n</answer>\n</end_header_id|end_header_id>\n\nGiven a detailed analysis, a final corrected prediction considering accurate shifts would result in a grid that moves all non-zero numbers as far left as possible while maintaining their order relative to each other but ensuring they do not cross zero values to their left.\n\nThe final accurate prediction, taking into account accurate shifts and positions, would reflect moving numbers leftward.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0\n</answer>",

Specifically, we notice:\n- In the input grids, sequences of non-zero numbers seem to dictate the output.\n- The output grid appears to have uniform sections of 2s, 1s, and 0s.\n\n## 5: Detailed Pattern Observation\nUpon closer inspection:\n- The output grid seems to consist of continuous segments of 2s, followed by continuous segments of 1s or 0s, seemingly determined by the presence and values in the input grid.\n- Notably, any non-zero value in the input grid seems to trigger a change or dictate a segment in the output grid.\n\n## 6: Deriving the Rule\nThe rule seems to be that each segment of consecutive non-zero numbers in the input grid corresponds to a segment of the same number in the output grid, but the exact mapping isn't straightforward from the given examples. However, observing the transitions:\n- A sequence or presence of non-zero numbers in the input seems to map to a uniform output value.\n\n## 7: Specific Rule Identification\nA specific rule can be identified as follows:\n- If there's a non-zero number in the input grid, it seems to correspond to a '2' in the output grid for the leading edge of a sequence.\n- Continuous non-zero values seem to result in a '2' in the output for the start of a sequence, then a uniform value.\n\n## 8: Refining the Rule\nHowever, a simpler and more consistent rule appears to be:\n- The output grid changes (or segments) based on the input values. Specifically, any non-zero value seems to contribute to a segment of '2's in the output grid initially, then '1's or '0's based on input transitions.\n\n## 9: Finalizing the Rule\nUpon careful observation, a clear rule can be stated as:\n- For any sequence of numbers in the input grid, if there are any non-zero values, the output starts with '2's for the first sequence of non-zero numbers encountered, then transitions to '1's for subsequent sequences, with '0's elsewhere.\n\n## 10: Applying the Rule to Test Input\nGiven the test input: \n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0\n\n## Step 11: Predicting Output\nThe test input has sequences of non-zero numbers.

When there are different numbers (like 0 and 6), the output seems to change based on the position and possibly the neighborhood of the cell.\n\nHowever, looking closely:\n- In Example 1, the input and output are the same.\n- In Example 2, the input and output are the same.\n- In Example 3, the output shifts two 6s from the ends of the 0 section towards the center but keeps them as 6s.\n\n## Detailed Rule Identification\nUpon closer inspection, a clear rule isn't directly derived from simple visual inspection due to the nature of the examples provided. However, one pattern could be:\n- If all cells in the input grid have the same value, the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n- For grids with multiple values, the rule seems to preserve the original grid structure without altering values based on their positions relative to others of the same or different values.\n\n## Applying to Test Input\nGiven the test input:\n0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we follow the observed pattern where grids with single or uniform values across result in identical outputs, and changes occur based on positional changes or neighborhood, the test input seems to have a clear division.\n\n## Predicting Output\nThe test input grid has a clear division with 0s at the ends and 7s in the middle.

Start with the first row: \n   - The first 4 is non-zero, so it stays 4.\n   - The next 0 is adjacent to a 4 (no, it's at the start), but since there's no non-zero adjacent to it horizontally or vertically within the given grid cells, we check further.\n\n2.

          "full_model_response": "To derive the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\nInput:  8 8 0 0 1 1 0 0 8 8 0 0 7 0 0\nOutput: 8 8 3 3 1 1 3 3 8 8 3 0 7 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\nInput:  1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\nOutput: 1 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 3 0 3 6 6 3 0\n\n### Example 3:\nInput:  5 5 0 0 2 2 0 0 6 0 0 0 1 1 0\nOutput: 5 5 3 3 2 2 3 0 6 0 0 3 1 1 3\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: Looking at the examples, it seems that the rule involves changing the zeros (0s) in the input grid to 3s in the output grid, but only under certain conditions. The non-zero numbers seem to remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Identifying Conditions for Change**: In all examples, zeros (0s) in the input grid are replaced by 3s in the output grid if they are not adjacent to (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) any non-zero number in the input grid.\n\n3. **Understanding Adjacency**: For a zero to be replaced by a 3 in the output grid, it must be surrounded by zeros or non-zero numbers that do not change it to a 3 based on their position.\n\n4. **Rule Identification**: \n    - **Non-zero numbers remain unchanged**: They keep their original values.\n    - **Zeros change to 3s if adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a non-zero number**: If a zero is next to a non-zero number, it gets replaced by a 3.\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n\nGiven the input:\n4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply the rule:\n\n- The zeros adjacent to non-zero numbers (5, 4, 9) will change to 3s.\n- Non-zero numbers remain the same.\n\n### Step-by-Step Application:\n\n1. Start with the first row: \n   - The first 4 is non-zero, so it stays 4.\n   - The next 0 is adjacent to a 4 (no, it's at the start), but since there's no non-zero adjacent to it horizontally or vertically within the given grid cells, we check further.\n\n2. Detailed Check:\n   - The first 0 will become 3 because it's adjacent to a 4.\n   - The next 0 will also become 3 for the same reason.\n\nSo, applying this logic:\n\nInput:\n4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput, considering the rule:\n4 3 3 5 5 3 3 3 9 9 9 3 3 3 0\n\n<answer>\n4 3 3 5 5 3 3 3 9 9 9 3 3 3 0\n</answer>",
