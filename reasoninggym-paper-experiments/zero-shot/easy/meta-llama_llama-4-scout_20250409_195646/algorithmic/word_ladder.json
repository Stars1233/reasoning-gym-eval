A better approach is to change 'S' to 'S' is close to 'T', so let's think of changing 'V' to get a common word. Changing 'V' to 'P' gives 'SHIP', which is a valid word.\n\n## 4: Transform 'SHIP' towards 'TARP'\nFrom 'SHIP', we can change 'S' to 'T' to get 'THIP' or 'SHIP' to 'SHIP' is a good start, but let's try to get closer to 'TARP'. Changing 'SHIP' to 'CHIP' or directly trying to get to 'TARP' by changing one letter at a time: 'SHIP' to 'SHIP' is not helpful, so let's try 'SHIP' to 'SLIP' or directly to 'TARP'. Changing 'SH' to 'TA' directly seems hard, so let's try 'SHIP' to 'SLIP' then to something else.\n\n## 5: Continue transformation\nChanging 'SHIP' to 'SLIP' is one step.

So, 'TRAP' to 'TARP' by changing 'P' is not possible directly, but we see 'TRAP' is one step from 'TARP' if we change 'TRAP' to 'TARP' by swapping or changing one letter which seems direct.\n\n## 8: Detailed transformation\nThe detailed transformation could be: SHIV -> SHIP -> SLIP -> TRIP -> TRAP -> TARP.\n\n## 9: Verify each step is a valid word\n1.

Directly aiming for 'ZITI', let's consider 'ZELL' then change to get closer.\n\n## 8: Finding an optimal path\nA potential path could be: CELL -> SELL -> SILT -> ZILT is not valid since 'ZILT' is not commonly recognized, however, CELL -> ZELL -> ZILT -> ZITI seems promising but 'ZILT' isn't standard. Let's refine: CELL -> WELL -> ZELL -> ZILT -> ZITI doesn't work because 'ZILT' isn't a word. Consider CELL -> PELL -> PELT -> PILT -> ZILT -> ZITI, but again, 'ZILT' isn't standard.\n\n## 9: Refined path\nRefining further, CELL -> CILL is not helpful, but CELL -> DELL -> DILT -> ZILT doesn't work. However, CELL -> SELL -> SILT -> ZILT doesn't directly help. Noticing that, a simpler path could involve: CELL -> ZELL -> ZILL -> ZITI or similar.\n\n## 10: Finalizing the path\nA viable path seems to be: CELL -> ZELL -> ZEAL -> ZILT doesn't work since we need valid words. So let's correct and finalize: \n- CELL to ZELL (change C to Z),\n- ZELL to ZILT doesn't work directly as we seek common words,\n- Consider then CELL -> SELL -> ZELL -> ZILT -> ZITI or similar.\n\n## 11: Actual viable path\nA correct sequence could be:\nCELL, SELL, SILT, ZILT, ZITI or finding a closer relation.\n\n## 12: Specific viable steps\nLet's list and find: \n1. CELL\n2. SELL\n3. SILT\n4. ZILT (not common)\nInstead, \nCELL -> ZELL -> ZILL -> ZITI seems more straightforward.\n\n## 13: Final sequence\nThe sequence could then practically be: \nCELL -> ZELL -> ZILL -> ZITI.\n\n## 14: Convert to required format\nSo, the steps in order are: CELL, ZELL, ZILL, ZITI.\n\n## 15: Write in required format\nCELL,ZELL,ZILL,ZITI\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>CELL,ZELL,ZILL,ZITI</answer>",

A better approach is to change 'L' to 'M' to get 'MOUD', still not common. Changing 'L' to 'T' gives 'TOUD', which is not a word. However, changing 'L' to 'C' gives 'COUD' or more appropriately 'CLOUD', which is a valid word.\n\n## 4: Continue transforming 'CLOUD' towards 'TELL'\nFrom 'CLOUD', we can change 'C' to 'M' to get 'MLOUD', which is not a word. Changing 'C' to 'T' gives 'TLOUD', not a word. A valid step is to change 'CLOUD' to 'CLOOD' by changing 'U' to 'O', but that's not helpful. Changing 'C' to 'S' gives 'SLOUD', not a word. However, changing 'CLOUD' to 'CLOUT' by changing 'D' to 'T' is valid.\n\n## 5: Further transformation\nFrom 'CLOUT', we can change 'C' to 'T' to get 'TLOUT', but a more efficient step would be to change 'CLOUT' to 'CLOUT' to 'TLOUT' or directly find a path. Changing 'CL' to 'TE' isn't straightforward. Instead, notice 'CLOUT' can become 'CROUT' by changing 'L' to 'R'.\n\n## 6: Continue towards 'TELL'\nFrom 'CROUT', changing 'C' to 'T' gives 'TROUT', which is a valid word.\n\n## 7: Get closer to 'TELL'\nFrom 'TROUT', changing 'T' to 'B' isn't helpful, but changing 'T' to 'S' gives 'SROUT', not a word. However, 'TROUT' to 'TROLL' isn't a one-step change to 'TELL'.

Directly from 'TROUT', consider 'TROUT' to 'TROLL' isn't optimal. Instead, 'TROUT' to 'TELL' could be: 'TROUT' to 'TROLL' isn't one step, consider 'CLOUD' to 'CLOUT' to 'CROUT' wasn't optimal. Reconsider: 'LOUD' to 'LOUT' to 'TELL' or similar. 'LOUD' to 'LOUT' by changing 'D' to 'T' gives 'LOUT'. Then 'LOUT' to 'LOT' by changing 'U' to 'O', and 'LOT' to 'TELL' isn't straightforward.\n\n## 9: Efficient path\nAn efficient path could be: 'LOUD' -> 'LOUT' -> 'LOUT' to 'LENT' or similar, directly: 'LOUD' -> 'LOUT' -> 'LUST' -> 'LIST' -> 'TELL' or find a better route. \nDirect route: 'LOUD' -> 'LOOD' -> 'LOOD' to 'TOOD' isn't it, 'LOUD' -> 'MOOD' -> 'MOOL' isn't valid, but 'LOUD' -> 'LOOD' -> 'WOOD' -> 'WOLD' -> 'TOLD' -> 'TELL'.\n\n## 10: Execute the efficient path\n'LOUD' -> 'MOOD' (change L to M), 'MOOD' -> 'MOLD' (change O to L), 'MOLD' -> 'MELL' or similar, actually: 'LOUD' -> 'MOOD' -> 'MOOL' isn't valid. So, directly: \n'LOUD', 'MOOD', 'MOLD', 'MELL', 'TELL'.\n\n## 11: Write down the sequence\nThe sequence could be: LOUD -> MOOD -> MOOL isn't valid. So 'LOUD' to 'MOOD' (L to M), 'MOOD' to 'TOOD' isn't direct. Consider 'LOUD' -> 'HOUD' isn't valid. So directly changing: LOUD to MOOD, MOOD to TOOD isn't valid. LOUD -> CLOUD -> CLOUT -> OUT -> TELL or similar.\n\n## 12: Final sequence\nLOUD -> CLOUD -> CLOUT -> OUT -> TELL or directly valid changes. Actually, LOUD -> MOOD -> TOOD -> TOOL -> TELL isn't it.

Changing 'BEAD' to 'BEAM' then to 'SEAM' to 'SEAN' to 'SAWN' seems plausible but let's correct and simplify: 'BEAD' to 'SEAD' to 'SEAM' to 'SEAN' to 'SAWN' or directly 'BEAD' to 'LEAD' to 'LOAD' to 'LOAN' to 'SAWN' or more directly 'BEAD' to 'HEAD' to 'SEAD' doesn't directly help. A straightforward path is 'BEAD' to 'SEAD' to 'SEAM' doesn't help. Consider 'BEAD' to 'READ' to 'LEAN' doesn't work. Directly: 'BEAD' -> 'SEAD' -> 'SEAN' -> 'SAWN'.\n\n## 6: Execute the transformation\nBEAD -> SEAD -> SEAN -> SAWN or finding a better route: BEAD -> HEAD -> SEAD -> SEAN -> SAWN or more efficiently BEAD -> LEAD -> LOAD -> LOAN -> SAWN.\n\n## 7: Verify each step is a valid word\n- BEAD\n- LEAD\n- LOAD\n- LOAN\n- SAWN\n\nEach step is a valid English word.\n\n## 8: Provide the solution as a comma-separated sequence\nBEAD,LEAD,LOAD,LOAN,SAWN\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>BEAD,LEAD,LOAD,LOAN,SAWN</answer>",

However, changing 'M' to 'R' gives 'RAZE', and then from 'RAZE', we can change 'R' to 'I' to get 'IAZE' which is not a valid word. A better step would be to change 'MAZE' to 'MAZE' > 'MINE' by changing 'Z' to 'N'.\n\n## 5: Continue the transformation\nFrom 'MINE', we can change 'M' to 'L' to get 'LINE', and then from 'LINE', we can change 'L' to 'INNS' by changing 'E' to 'S' but directly getting to 'INNS' from a closer word is needed.\n\n## 6: Refine the steps for accuracy and validity\nA refined step: 'DAZE' > 'DAZE' to 'DINE' by changing 'A' to 'I' and 'Z' to 'N' and 'E' to 'E' which results in 'DINE'. \nThen, 'DINE' to 'INNE' is not valid, but 'DINE' to 'INNE' could be approached by changing 'D' to 'I' and getting 'INE' is not valid, however 'DINE' > 'INNE' is not a single step change to a known word directly. \nDirect change: 'DAZE' > 'DIZE' is not common, 'DAZE' > 'GAZE' > 'GAIN' > 'INNS' or similar paths.\n\n## 7: Execute a valid transformation\nExecuting a valid transformation: \n- 'DAZE' to 'GAZE' (change D to G),\n- 'GAZE' to 'GAIN' (change Z to I, and E to N, but one step at a time: 'GAZE' to 'GAIN'),\n- Then 'GAIN' to 'INNS' by changing 'G' to 'I' and 'A' to 'N'.\n\n## 8: Detailed transformation steps\n1. 'DAZE' > 'GAZE',\n2. 'GAZE' > 'GAIN',\n3. 'GAIN' > 'INNS' by changing 'G' to 'I'.\n\nHowever, detailed examination gives:\n- 'DAZE' to 'GAZE',\n- 'GAZE' to 'GAIN',\n- 'GAIN' to 'INNS'.\n\nLet's adjust for optimal path and validity:\n- 'DAZE' > 'GAZE',\n- 'GAZE' > 'GAIN',\n- 'GAIN' > 'INNS'.\n\nThe optimal and straightforward path seems:\n'DAZE', 'GAZE', 'GAIN', 'INNS' or finding a closer relation.\n\n## 9: Final transformation\nA simpler path could be:\n'DAZE' > 'DINE' > 'LINE' > 'INNS' or similar.\n\nDirect and simple path:\nDAZE > DINE > LINE > INNS or \nDAZE > GAZE > GAIN > INNS.\n\n## 10: Provide the comma-separated sequence\nUsing 'DAZE' > 'DINE' > 'LINE' > 'INNS':\nD,A,Z,E -> D,I,N,E -> L,I,N,E -> I,N,N,S \nSo, DAZE, DINE, LINE, INNS.\n\nThe final answer is: \nDAZE,DINE,LINE,INNS \n\nConverting to comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters: \nDAZE,DINE,LINE,INNS \n\n<answer>DAZE,DINE,LINE,INNS</answer>",
