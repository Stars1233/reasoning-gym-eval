Subtract 3343 from both sides to get $-2520*g = -69737 - 3343$.\n\n## 3: Perform the subtraction on the right side\n$-69737 - 3343 = -73080$. So, the equation becomes $-2520*g = -73080$.\n\n## 4: Solve for $g$\nDivide both sides by $-2520$ to solve for $g$: $g = \\frac{-73080}{-2520}$.\n\n## 5: Perform the division\n$g = \\frac{-73080}{-2520} = 29$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>29</answer>",
