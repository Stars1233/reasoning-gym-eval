The game is played on a grid with various elements: the player (*), the player on a goal (%), boxes (@), boxes on goals ($), goals (X), walls (+), and empty positions (-).\n\n## 2: Analyze the Given Puzzle\nGiven the puzzle:\n```\n+ + + + + +  \n+ + - * - +  \n+ $ $ @ @ +  \n+ X - - X +  \n+ X @ - - +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ - - - - +  \n+ - - @ X +  \n+ + + + + +\n```\nThe player is represented by *, boxes by @, goals by X, a box on a goal by $, and walls by +. The objective is to move all boxes onto the goals.\n\n## 3: Identify the Player, Boxes, and Goals\nThe player is at position (1,1) if we consider the top-left corner as (0,0). There are boxes at positions (2,2) and (2,3), and goals at (1,3) and (3,1).\n\n## 4: Plan the Moves\nTo solve this, we need to push the boxes onto the goals. The most efficient way is to move the boxes to the goals without getting them stuck.\n\n## 5: Determine the Optimal Path\nLooking at the puzzle, one of the boxes is already on a goal ($ at (2,1)). We need to move the other boxes (@ at (2,2) and (2,3)) onto the goals (X at (1,3) and (3,1)).\n\n## 6: Execute the Moves\nThe player starts at (1,1). To move the box at (2,2) to the goal at (3,1), and the box at (2,3) to the goal at (1,3), we have to navigate through the grid carefully.\n\n## 7: Find a Solution Path\nA potential solution involves moving right, then up, then left, and so on, to push boxes onto goals. However, without visual aids or a step-by-step simulation, we deduce logically.\n\n## 8: Logical Deduction for Moves\nGiven the constraints and the goal, one potential sequence could involve:\n- Moving down and right to position boxes on goals.\n\n## 9: Specific Moves\nLet's consider specific moves based on Sokoban logic:\n1.

The puzzle is represented by a grid of characters, each with a specific meaning: `+` for walls, `-` for empty spaces, `X` for goals, `@` for the player, `$` for boxes on goals, `%` for the player on a goal, and `*` is not present but presumably could represent the player in some contexts.\n\n## 2: Identify the Player and Goals\nThe player is represented by `@` and is currently at position `(3, 1)`. The goals are represented by `X` at position `(3, 0)`, and there are boxes represented by `$` at positions `(3, 4)` and `(6, 3)`, `(6, 4)`.\n\n## 3: Determine the Objective\nThe objective is to move all boxes onto the goals. There is one goal at `(3, 0)` and two boxes at `(6, 3)` and `(6, 4)`.\n\n## 4: Plan the Moves\nTo solve this, we need to move the boxes onto the goals. The goal is at `(3, 0)`, and there are two boxes at `(6, 3)` and `(6, 4)`. We should move the boxes to the goals.\n\n## 5: Execute the Plan\nFirst, let's move the player to the box at `(6, 3)`. The player needs to push the box at `(6, 3)` to `(3, 0)` but since we can't move through walls or outside the grid, we plan the moves carefully.\n\n## 6: Detailed Moves\nThe player starts at `(3, 1)`. Let's assume we move right, down, left, up, and so on, to push boxes onto goals.\n\n## 7: Specific Moves\nGiven the complexity, let's analyze:\n- Move the player to `(6, 2)` to be able to push the box at `(6, 3)` towards the goal.\n- Push the box at `(6, 3)` to `(5, 3)`, then to `(4, 3)`, and finally to the goal at `(3, 0)` if possible, or find a suitable path.\n\n## 8: Actual Moves\nLet's consider actual movements:\n1. The player is at `(3, 1)`.\n2. Move down to `(4, 1)`, then down to `(5, 1)`, right to `(5, 2)`, down to `(6, 2)`, right to `(6, 3)`, up to `(5, 3)`, up to `(4, 3)`, left to `(3, 3)`, up to `(2, 3)`, left to `(2, 2)`, left to `(2, 1)`, up to `(2, 0)`, right to `(3, 0)` is not directly possible because of walls and boxes.\n\n## 9: Finding an Efficient Path\nAn efficient path seems to involve moving the boxes to the goals by navigating around walls and using the empty spaces.\n\n## 10: Solution\nAfter analyzing, one potential sequence could be:\n- Move down, right, down, right, up, left, up, left, down, right, down, right, up, left, up.\n\nHowever, providing a step-by-step move in Sokoban requires representing each move as a character (L, R, U, D) which corresponds to left, right, up, and down respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>DDRRURDDLDRRUURRDDL</answer>",

The puzzle is represented by a grid of characters, each with a specific meaning: `+` for walls, `-` for empty spaces, `X` for goals, `@` for the player, `$` for boxes on goals, `%` for the player on a goal, and `*` is not present but presumably could represent the player in some contexts.\n\n## 2: Identify the Player and Goals\nThe player is represented by `@` and is currently at position `(3, 1)`. The goals are represented by `X` at position `(3, 0)`, and there are boxes represented by `$` at positions `(3, 4)` and `(6, 3)`, `(6, 4)`.\n\n## 3: Determine the Objective\nThe objective is to move all boxes onto the goals. There is one goal at `(3, 0)` and two boxes at `(6, 3)` and `(6, 4)`.\n\n## 4: Plan the Moves\nTo solve this, we need to move the boxes onto the goals.

The game state is represented by a grid of characters, each with a specific meaning: `+` for walls, `-` for empty spaces, `*` for the player, `@` for boxes, `X` for goals, and `$` for boxes on goals.\n\n## 2: Identify the Player and Boxes\nThe player's current position is marked by `*`, boxes are marked by `@` or `$` (if on a goal), and goals are marked by `X`. The initial state of the puzzle needs to be analyzed to identify the player's position, the boxes, and the goals.\n\n## 3: Analyze the Initial State\nLooking at the given puzzle:\n```\n+ + + + + + + + +  \n+ - - - X - $ X +  \n+ - - X - - - - +  \n+ - @ @ - @ - - +  \n+ - @ - - @ X + +  \n+ - - - - - - - +  \n+ X @ X - - - - +  \n+ - - * + - $ - +  \n+ + + + + + + + +\n```\nThe player is at `*`, boxes are at `@`, goals are at `X`, and a box on a goal is at `$`.\n\n## 4: Determine the Objective\nThe objective is to move all boxes onto the goals.

The player can move up, down, left, or right, and can push boxes in these directions if they are next to a box.\n\n## 6: Find a Solution\nGiven the complexity of Sokoban puzzles, a step-by-step move plan is required. However, without visual aids or the ability to simulate moves in real-time here, we can deduce logically:\n- The player starts at `(8,1)`.\n- A box is at `(4,3)`, another at `(5,3)`, and a third at `(7,7)`.\n- Goals are at `(2,7)`, `(4,7)`, and `(7,1)`.\n\n## 7: Propose a Sequence of Moves\nA potential sequence could involve moving the player to push boxes onto goals efficiently.

The closest goal to this box seems to be at (3,2) or (3,3), but we need to navigate the player to push it correctly.\n\n## 3: Plan the Moves for the Second Box (@)\nThe second box (@) is at (2,2).

The closest goal to this box seems to be at (3,2) or (3,3), but we need to navigate the player to push it correctly.\n\n## 3: Plan the Moves for the Second Box (@)\nThe second box (@) is at (2,2). We should aim to push it onto a goal as well.\n\n## 4: Strategy\nA possible strategy involves moving the player to position the boxes on the goals. Given that there are two goals and two boxes, we should try to push one box onto a goal and then move to position the second box onto the other goal.\n\n## 5: Detailed Moves\nLet's denote the player's initial position as (1,1), the box $ at (1,2), and the box @ at (2,2). \n\nTo push the $ box onto a goal:\n- Move player right to (1,3) is not possible due to the wall.\n- Move player down to (2,1) then right to (2,2) to be next to @, then move @ down.\n\nHowever, without visual aids and step-by-step trial, we deduce logically:\n- The player needs to push boxes onto X's.\n\n## 6: Solution Approach\nGiven the constraints and aiming for efficiency:\n- Move the player * down to (2,1) \n- Then move right to (2,2) which is occupied by @, push @ down.\n\nLet's assume a sequence that could work given typical Sokoban solving strategies, focusing on moving boxes to goals.\n\n## 7: Actual Moves\nThe optimal sequence can be complex without trial and error, but let's assume and calculate:\n1. Player moves down to (2,1).\n2. Then right to (2,2) and push @ down.\n3. Move player back up and position for $.\n\n## 8: Specific Moves String\nLet's consider a potential move sequence based on standard Sokoban movement (L, R, U, D).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>DDRRUURRDDLLRUUR</answer>",

The goals are at `(2,5)` and `(5,1)`.\n\n## 2: Plan the Moves\nTo solve the puzzle efficiently, we should aim to move the boxes onto the goals in as few moves as possible. \n\n## 3: Move the Box at (2,1) to (2,5) Goal\nFirst, let's focus on moving the box at `(2,1)` towards the goal at `(5,1)`.

Move the box at (6,2) towards a goal.\n\n## 6: Actual Moves\nLet's consider actual moves based on Sokoban rules (pushing boxes):\n- The player is at (3,5).\n- Move up to (3,4) then (3,3), push box at (3,3) to (4,3) if feasible.\n\n## 7: Solution\nThe optimal sequence of moves (up, down, left, right) needs to be determined. Given the grid and Sokoban rules, let's find a feasible path.\n\n<answer>LURRDLDRRUURDDLURR</answer>",

Move down to (2,1): \n   - Player moves down: D\n   - Grid: \n     ```\n     + + + + + + + + + +  \n     + - - * - - - - X +  \n     + @ @ @ @ - - @ - +  \n     + - - - - X - $ - +  \n     + X - - - $ X - - +  \n     + X - - - - - - - +  \n     + + + + + + + + + +  \n     ```\n2. Push box right and then down, adjusting player's position accordingly.\n\n## 6: Actual Moves\nLet's assume a sequence that could work given typical Sokoban solving strategies:\n- The player needs to navigate and push boxes onto goals efficiently.\n\n## 7: Specific Moves Sequence\nAfter analyzing, one potential sequence could be:\n- Move right, then down, push boxes onto goals.\n\n## 8: Solution\nGiven the complexity and without visual aids, a direct computed solution seems challenging. However, let's assume and compute:\nA potential move sequence could be \"DDRURURDRDR\".\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>DRURDDRURDR</answer>",
