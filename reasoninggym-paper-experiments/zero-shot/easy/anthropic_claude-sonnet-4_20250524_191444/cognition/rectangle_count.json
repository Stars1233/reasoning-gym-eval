Next, I see a smaller rectangle in the lower-right area:\n   - It starts around row 75\n   - It's also outlined with '#' characters\n   - This forms a complete rectangle with all four borders\n\nI don't see any '\u2588' characters in the grid, which means there are no overlapping rectangles.\n\nLet me verify by checking the structure:\n\nRectangle 1 (larger):\n```\n###########################################\n#                                         #\n#                                         #\n#                                         #\n###########################################\n```\n\nRectangle 2 (smaller):\n```\n####\n#  #\n#  #\n#  #\n####\n```\n\nBoth are complete rectangles with proper borders made of '#' characters.\n\n<answer>2</answer>",

Large left rectangle\n2. Medium rectangle (upper-middle)\n3. Small rectangle (upper-right)\n4. First overlapping rectangle\n5. Second overlapping rectangle  \n6. Bottom wide rectangle\n7. Small embedded rectangle\n\n<answer>7</answer>",

This is outlined entirely with '#' characters.\n\n2. **Second rectangle**: There's a large rectangle that starts around row 15 and extends down to the bottom of the grid (around row 56). This rectangle spans from approximately column 44 to column 73.\n\n3. **Overlapping area**: I can see '\u2588' characters where these two rectangles overlap.

Additional internal rectangles: Looking more carefully, I can identify more rectangular subdivisions within the main structure.\n\nLet me trace each one more carefully:\n\n- Main large rectangle (leftmost)\n- Upper right rectangle \n- Middle right rectangle with internal subdivisions\n- Small internal rectangle within the left structure\n- Lower left rectangle\n- Bottom spanning rectangle\n- Small rectangle on far right\n- Additional internal rectangles created by the grid divisions\n\nCounting all distinct rectangles (including those that overlap, as indicated by the \u2588 symbols):\n\n1. Main outer left rectangle\n2. Upper right rectangle\n3. Middle right rectangle  \n4. Small internal rectangle (upper middle)\n5. Lower internal rectangle (within left structure)\n6. Bottom horizontal rectangle\n7. Small rectangle (far right)\n8. Additional internal rectangle divisions\n\nAfter carefully tracing all the rectangular boundaries and accounting for overlapping areas marked with \u2588, I count a total of 8 distinct rectangles.\n\n<answer>8</answer>",

Small rectangle nested inside rectangle 3\n5. Small rectangle at the bottom-right corner\n6. Rectangle at the bottom-left that overlaps with rectangle 1\n7. Small rectangle at the far right (appears to be a thin rectangle)\n8. Rectangle at the bottom that overlaps with rectangle 6\n9. Rectangle in the middle-bottom area that overlaps with rectangle 8\n10. Small rectangle that appears to overlap with rectangle 9\n\nLet me trace through more carefully:\n\n- There's a large vertical rectangle on the left\n- A horizontal rectangle that intersects it (creating overlap marked with \u2588)\n- A rectangle in the upper-middle-right area\n- A smaller rectangle nested within that one\n- A small rectangle in the far right\n- A rectangle at the bottom left\n- A rectangle at the bottom that intersects with others\n- A rectangle in the lower middle area\n- A small rectangle at the bottom right\n\nCounting systematically and checking for all distinct rectangular shapes:\n\n1. Main tall rectangle (leftmost)\n2. Wide rectangle that intersects the first one\n3. Rectangle in upper-middle-right\n4. Small rectangle nested in #3\n5. Small rectangle at far right\n6. Rectangle at bottom-left\n7. Rectangle at bottom-center\n8. Rectangle in lower-middle\n9. Small rectangle at bottom-right\n10. Additional rectangle that creates some of the overlaps\n\n<answer>10</answer>",

Small bottom-right rectangle\n\n<answer>6</answer>",

Below that, I can see another smaller rectangle at the bottom:\n   - Top border: a line of '#' characters\n   - Left border: '#' character\n   - Right border: '#' character\n   - Bottom border: a line of '#' characters\n   This forms a second complete rectangle.\n\nI don't see any '\u2588' characters in the grid, which means there are no overlapping rectangles to account for.\n\nThe grid contains exactly 2 rectangles total.\n\n<answer>2</answer>",

Let me trace each rectangle:\n\nRectangle 1: The larger rectangle on the right\n- Starts around column 34, extends to about column 73\n- Starts around row 55, extends down to about row 71\n- This forms a complete rectangle outlined with '#'\n\nRectangle 2: The rectangle on the left\n- Starts around column 14, extends to about column 55\n- Starts around row 60, extends down to about row 80\n- This forms a complete rectangle outlined with '#'\n\n4. The '\u2588' characters appear where these two rectangles overlap:\n   - At the top-right corner of the left rectangle where it meets the right rectangle\n   - At the bottom-left corner of the right rectangle where it meets the left rectangle\n\n5. These '\u2588' characters indicate overlapping areas but don't create additional rectangles - they're part of the two main rectangles I've identified.\n\nTherefore, I count 2 distinct rectangles total.\n\n<answer>2</answer>",

I don't see any '\u2588' characters, which would indicate overlapping rectangles\n\nThe rectangle appears to be:\n- Top border: row 9, columns 13-36 (24 '#' characters)\n- Left border: column 13, rows 9-55\n- Right border: column 36, rows 9-55  \n- Bottom border: row 55, columns 13-36 (24 '#' characters)\n\nThis forms one complete rectangle. There are no other rectangles visible in the grid, and there are no overlapping rectangles (no '\u2588' characters).\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Left rectangle: Overlaps with the large rectangle (shown with '\u2588' at intersection)\n5. Small rectangle inside left rectangle: Clearly outlined with '#'\n6. Bottom rectangle: Overlaps with the large rectangle (shown with '\u2588' at intersection)\n7. Bottom-left rectangle: Overlaps with the bottom rectangle (shown with '\u2588' at intersection)\n\nCounting systematically:\n- Rectangle 1: Upper standalone rectangle\n- Rectangle 2: Large encompassing rectangle\n- Rectangle 3: Small rectangle in upper right\n- Rectangle 4: Left overlapping rectangle\n- Rectangle 5: Small rectangle inside left rectangle\n- Rectangle 6: Bottom overlapping rectangle\n- Rectangle 7: Bottom-left overlapping rectangle\n\n<answer>7</answer>",

Let me trace each rectangle:\n\nRectangle 1: The large vertical rectangle on the right side - this forms a complete rectangle with '#' borders.\n\nRectangle 2: The horizontal rectangle in the middle-left - this forms a complete rectangle with '#' borders.\n\nRectangle 3: The smaller horizontal rectangle in the lower-left - this forms a complete rectangle with '#' borders.\n\n4. Checking for overlaps:\nThe '\u2588' characters indicate where Rectangle 1 and Rectangle 2 overlap, confirming these are indeed separate rectangles that intersect.\n\nTherefore, I count 3 distinct rectangles total.\n\n<answer>3</answer>",

Left side: A tall rectangle outlined with '#' (starts around row 27 and goes down)\n\n4. Center-right area: There's a complex overlapping region with '\u2588' symbols, indicating multiple rectangles intersecting. I can see:\n   - A horizontal rectangle \n   - A vertical rectangle\n   - These create the overlapping '\u2588' pattern\n\n5.

Bottom area: Another rectangle that intersects with others (creating '\u2588' symbols)\n\nLooking more carefully at the overlapping regions marked with '\u2588':\n- There are multiple intersection points showing where rectangles overlap\n- Each '\u2588' indicates where exactly 2 rectangles overlap\n\nCounting systematically:\n1.

I also notice what appears to be a third rectangle in the bottom right area:\n   - It's a smaller rectangle outlined with '#' characters\n   - This is 1 rectangle\n\nLet me double-check by tracing each rectangle:\n- Rectangle 1: Large rectangle in the middle-upper area (rows ~25-40)\n- Rectangle 2: Rectangle in lower area (around row 68-72)\n- Rectangle 3: Rectangle overlapping/adjacent to rectangle 2\n- Rectangle 4: Small rectangle in bottom right\n\nCounting all the distinct rectangles formed by '#' outlines, I can identify 4 rectangles total.\n\n<answer>4</answer>",
