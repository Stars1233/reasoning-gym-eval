Position (4,1) must be 2 or 4.\nColumn 2 has 2,1 and needs 3,4. Position (4,2) must be 3 or 4.\n\nIf (4,1)=2 and (4,2)=4: bottom-left subgrid gets 3,1,2,4 \u2713\nIf (4,1)=4 and (4,2)=2: this contradicts column 2 having 2 already.\n\nSo (4,1)=2, (4,2)=4.\n\nNow Row 4: 2 4 _ 4 - impossible! Can't have two 4s.\n\nLet me try (3,2)=4, (3,3)=1:\nRow 3: 3 4 1 2 \u2713\nBottom-left subgrid needs 1,2 in (4,1) and (4,2).\nColumn 1 needs 2,4 in (2,1) and (4,1).\nColumn 2 needs 1,3 in (2,2) and (4,2).\n\nIf (4,1)=2, then column 1 constraint satisfied, and (4,2)=1.\nBut column 2 needs 1,3, and if (4,2)=1, then (2,2)=3.\nRow 4: 2 1 _ 4, needs 3 in position (4,3).\n\nLet's check: Column 3 has 4,1 and needs 2,3.

Since column 4 already has 2 and 3, it needs 1 and 4. So row 3, column 4 must be 1.\n\nRow 3: 4 _ _ 1\n\nNow column 4 needs only 4, which must go in row 2, column 4.\nRow 2: _ _ 2 4\n\nIn the bottom-right subgrid, we now have 1, 2, 3, so we need 4. This goes in row 4, column 3.\nRow 4: _ _ 4 3\n\nNow column 3 has 2, 4 and needs 1, 3. Row 1 needs 1 in column 3 or elsewhere. Row 3 needs 3 in column 2 or 3. Since column 3 needs 1 and 3, and row 1 needs these numbers, row 1 column 3 gets either 1 or 3.\n\nLooking at the top-right subgrid: it has 2, 4 and needs 1, 3. Row 1 column 3 and row 1 column 4 need to be 1 and 3.\nSince row 1 column 4 can be 1 or 3, and we need both in this subgrid...\n\nLet me check row 1 column 4: Column 4 has 1, 3, 4 and needs 2. So row 1 column 4 = 2.\nRow 1: 1 _ _ 2\n\nNow the top-right subgrid has 2, 2, 4 - that's wrong. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, let me recheck column 4: it has 2 (row 3), 3 (row 4), so it needs 1 and 4.\nRow 3 column 4 should be 1 (as determined), row 2 column 4 should be 4, and row 1 column 4 should be... wait, that's 3 positions for 2 numbers.\n\nLet me restart more carefully:\n\nColumn 4: row 3 has 2, row 4 has 3, so positions 1 and 2 need 1 and 4.\nRow 2 already has 2, so row 2 column 4 can be 1 or 4.\nRow 1 needs 2, 3, 4, so row 1 column 4 can be 4.\n\nIf row 1 column 4 = 4, then row 2 column 4 = 1.\nRow 1: 1 _ _ 4\nRow 2: _ _ 2 1\n\nNow row 2 needs 3 and 4 in columns 1 and 2.\nColumn 1 has 1, 4 and needs 2, 3. So row 2 column 1 must be 3.\nRow 2: 3 _ 2 1\n\nThen row 2 column 2 = 4.\nRow 2: 3 4 2 1\n\nColumn 2 now has 4 and needs 1, 2, 3.\nRow 1 column 2 can be 2 or 3 (row 1 needs 2, 3).\nRow 3 column 2 can be 1 or 3 (row 3 needs 1, 3).\nRow 4 column 2 can be 1 or 2 (row 4 needs 1, 2).\n\nRow 3 column 4: Column 4 has 1, 3, 4 and needs 2. But row 3 already has 2! \nThis means row 3 column 4 cannot be 2. Let me recheck...\n\nRow 3: 4 _ _ 2 (given)\nSo row 3 column 4 is 2 (given). Column 4 has 2, 3 and needs 1, 4.\nRow 1 column 4 and row 2 column 4 need 1 and 4.\n\nSince row 2 has 2, row 2 column 4 cannot be 2, so it's 1 or 4.\nRow 1 needs 2, 3, 4, so row 1 column 4 is 3 or 4.\nThe intersection means row 1 column 4 = 4, row 2 column 4 = 1.\n\nContinuing with this:\nRow 1: 1 _ _ 4\nRow 2: _ _ 2 1\nRow 3: 4 _ _ 2  \nRow 4: _ _ 4 3\n\nRow 2 needs 3, 4 in positions 1, 2. Column 1 needs 2, 3. So row 2 column 1 = 3.\nRow 2: 3 4 2 1\n\nRow 1 needs 2, 3 in positions 2, 3. Column 3 needs 1, 3. So row 1 column 3 = 3.\nRow 1: 1 2 3 4\n\nRow 3 needs 1, 3 in positions 2, 3. Column 3 needs 1. So row 3 column 3 = 1.\nRow 3: 4 3 1 2\n\nRow 4 needs 1, 2 in positions 1, 2. Column 1 needs 2.

In row 2, we now have 3 and 4, so we need 1 and 2. Position (2,3) can't be 1 (column 3 already has 1), so position (2,3) must be 2, and position (2,4) must be 1.\n\n5. In column 4, we now have 4 and 1, so we need 2 and 3. Position (3,4) can't be 1 (already in column), and row 3 needs 2, 3, 4. Since position (2,4) is 1, position (3,4) must be either 2 or 3.\n\n6. In row 3, position (3,1) needs to complete the bottom-left subgrid. We have 1 in this subgrid, need 2, 3, 4. Column 1 needs 2, 4. So position (3,1) could be 2 or 4.\n\n7. In the bottom-left subgrid, if (3,1) is 2, then (4,1) and (4,2) would need 3 and 4. Column 2 needs 1, 3, 4, so (4,2) could be 3.\n\n8. Let me try (3,1) = 4. Then row 3 needs 2, 3 in positions (3,2) and (3,4). Column 2 needs 1, 3, 4, so (3,2) could be 3. That would make (3,4) = 2.\n\n9. With (3,1) = 4, (3,2) = 3, (3,4) = 2, the bottom-left subgrid has 1, 3, 4 and needs 2. So (4,2) = 2.\n\n10. Column 1 now needs 2, so (4,1) = 2. But that conflicts with (4,2) = 2 in the same row.\n\nLet me try (3,1) = 2:\n- Row 3: 2 _ 1 _. Needs 3, 4 in positions (3,2) and (3,4).\n- Column 2 needs 1, 3, 4. Position (3,2) could be 3.\n- If (3,2) = 3, then (3,4) = 4.\n- Bottom-left subgrid now has 2, 3, 1. Needs 4. So (4,1) = 4 and (4,2) = 1.\n- Column 4 has 4, 1, 4 - this is wrong.\n\nLet me reconsider. If (3,2) = 4, then (3,4) = 3.\n- Bottom-left subgrid: 1, 2, 4. Needs 3. So (4,2) = 3.\n- Column 1 needs 1, 4. We have 3, 2. Need 1, 4. So (4,1) = 1.\n- Row 4: 1 3 _ _. Needs 2, 4. Column 3 needs 2, 3, 4. Has 1, 2, 4. Wait, let me recheck.\n\nColumn 3 has: 1 (from row 3). Needs 2, 3, 4.\nRow 4 position (4,3): could be 2 or 4.\nColumn 4 has: 4, 1, 3. Needs 2. So (4,4) = 2.\nTherefore (4,3) = 4.\n\n<answer>\n1 2 3 4\n3 4 2 1\n2 4 1 3\n4 3 4 2\n</answer>",

So [2,1] and [2,2] are 2, 4.\nBut [2,2] = 1 is wrong since column 2 already has 1 at [2,2].\n\nLet me restart more carefully:\n\n```\n_ 3 _ _\n_ _ _ 1  \n_ _ 2 3\n_ _ _ _\n```\n\nColumn 2 has 3, needs 1, 2, 4\nColumn 4 has 1, 3, needs 2, 4\nRow 3 has 2, 3, needs 1, 4\n\nBottom-right 2x2 has 2, 3, needs 1, 4\nSo [3,3] = 2, [3,4] = 3, and [4,3], [4,4] must be 1, 4\n\nSince column 4 needs 2, 4 and has 1, 3:\n[1,4] must be 2 or 4, [4,4] must be 2 or 4\nSince [4,4] must be 1 or 4 (from 2x2 constraint), [4,4] = 4\nTherefore [4,3] = 1 and [1,4] = 2\n\n```\n_ 3 _ 2\n_ _ _ 1\n_ _ 2 3  \n_ _ 1 4\n```\n\nRow 3 needs 1, 4 in positions [3,1], [3,2]\nColumn 2 has 3, needs 1, 2, 4\nIf [3,2] = 1, then [3,1] = 4\nIf [3,2] = 4, then [3,1] = 1\n\nColumn 1 will need the remaining numbers.\nLet's try [3,1] = 1, [3,2] = 4:\n\n```\n_ 3 _ 2\n_ _ _ 1\n1 4 2 3\n_ _ 1 4\n```\n\nRow 4 needs 2, 3 in positions [4,1], [4,2]\nColumn 1 has 1, needs 2, 3, 4\nColumn 2 has 3, 4, needs 1, 2\n\nSo [4,2] = 2 (column 2 needs 2), [4,1] = 3\n\n```\n_ 3 _ 2\n_ _ _ 1\n1 4 2 3\n3 2 1 4\n```\n\nNow top half:\nRow 1 has 3, 2, needs 1, 4: [1,1] and [1,3] are 1, 4\nRow 2 has 1, needs 2, 3, 4: [2,1], [2,2], [2,3] are 2, 3, 4\n\nColumn 1 has 1, 3, needs 2, 4: [1,1] and [2,1] are 2, 4\nColumn 2 has 3, 4, 2, needs 1: [2,2] = 1\nColumn 3 has 2, 1, needs 3, 4: [1,3] and [2,3] are 3, 4\n\nFrom row 1: if [1,1] = 4, then [1,3] = 1\nBut column 3 needs [1,3] to be 3 or 4, so [1,3] = 4, [1,1] = 1\n\nWait, that contradicts column 1 needing [1,1] to be 2 or 4.\nLet me try [3,1] = 4, [3,2] = 1:\n\n```\n_ 3 _ 2\n_ _ _ 1\n4 1 2 3\n_ _ 1 4\n```\n\nColumn 2 has 3, 1, needs 2, 4: [1,2] = 3 (given), so [2,2] and [4,2] are 2, 4\nRow 4 needs 2, 3: [4,1] and [4,2] are 2, 3\nSo [4,2] = 2, [4,1] = 3\n\n```\n_ 3 _ 2\n_ _ _ 1\n4 1 2 3\n3 2 1 4\n```\n\nColumn 2 now has 3, 1, 2, needs 4: but this is impossible since [1,2] = 3.\n\nLet me reconsider the bottom-right assignment.

So (2,3) = 1 and (2,4) = 2.\n\n14. Column 4 needs 1 in position (4,4), so (4,4) = 1.\n\n15.

Let me recheck the given puzzle:\n```\n_ 1 _ _\n4 _ _ _\n_ _ _ 2\n3 _ _ _\n```\n\nPosition (3,4) = 2, not (4,4).\n\nLet me restart more carefully:\n\nRow 4 needs 1, 2, 4 in positions (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\nColumn 4 needs 1, 3, 4 in positions (1,4), (2,4), (4,4).\n\nSo (4,4) needs to be 1 or 4 (intersection of row 4 and column 4 requirements).\n\nIf (4,4) = 1:\n- Row 4: 3 _ _ 1, needs 2 and 4 in positions (4,2) and (4,3)\n- Column 4: _ _ 2 1, needs 3 and 4 in positions (1,4) and (2,4)\n\nIf (4,4) = 4:\n- Row 4: 3 _ _ 4, needs 1 and 2 in positions (4,2) and (4,3)\n- Column 4: _ _ 2 4, needs 1 and 3 in positions (1,4) and (2,4)\n\nLet me try (4,4) = 4:\nRow 1 needs 3 and 4, but if (1,4) gets 1 or 3, then (1,3) gets the other of 3 and 4.\nRow 2 needs 1 and 2, and if (2,4) gets 1 or 3, then (2,3) gets 1 or 2.\n\nThis seems consistent. Let me continue with (4,4) = 4.\n\nColumn 4: positions (1,4) and (2,4) need 1 and 3.\nRow 1: positions (1,3) and (1,4) need 3 and 4.\nSo (1,4) = 3, making (1,3) = 4.\nThen (2,4) = 1, making (2,3) = 2.\n\nRow 4: 3 _ _ 4, needs 1 and 2 in positions (4,2) and (4,3).\nWe determined (4,2) = 2 earlier, so (4,3) = 1.\n\nFinal answer:\n```\n2 1 4 3\n4 3 2 1\n1 4 3 2\n3 2 1 4\n```\n\nLet me verify this satisfies all constraints:\n- Rows: \u2713 Each has 1,2,3,4\n- Columns: \u2713 Each has 1,2,3,4  \n- 2x2 subgrids: \u2713 Each has 1,2,3,4\n\n<answer>\n2 1 4 3\n4 3 2 1\n1 4 3 2\n3 2 1 4\n</answer>",

In row 2, positions 2 and 3 need 1 and 3. Looking at the top-left subgrid, it needs 1, 2, 3. Since position (2,2) is in this subgrid and row 2 needs 1 and 3, position (2,2) could be 1 or 3.\n\n2. Looking at column 2, it needs 1, 2, 4. Position (2,2) is in column 2, so it could be 1, 2, or 4. Combined with row 2 constraint, position (2,2) must be 1.\n\n3.

Row 3 needs 2, 3, 4. Position (3,4) must be 3 or 4.\n\n11. Row 4 needs 1, 2, 4. Since (4,3) = 2, row 4 needs 1 and 4 in positions (4,1) and (4,4).\n\n12. Bottom-right subgrid has 1 and 2, needs 3 and 4. So (3,4) and (4,4) are 3 and 4.\n\n13. If (3,4) = 3, then (4,4) = 4, and (4,1) = 1.\n\n14. This leaves (3,1) = 2 and (3,2) = 4.\n\n15. For row 1: (1,1) = 3 and (1,2) = 2.\n\nLet me verify:\n```\n3 2 4 1\n4 1 3 2\n2 4 1 3\n1 3 2 4\n```\n\n<answer>\n3 2 4 1\n4 1 3 2\n2 4 1 3\n1 3 2 4\n</answer>",

Looking at row 4: 3 _ 4 _\n   - Missing 1 and 2\n   - Column 2 position (row 4, col 2) and column 4 position (row 4, col 4)\n\n3. In bottom-left subgrid: we have 2 and 3, missing 1 and 4\n   - Row 3 col 2 and row 4 col 2 need 1 and 4\n\n4. Column 1 needs 1 and 4 in rows 1 and 2\n   - Row 1 col 1 and row 2 col 1\n\nLet me work more systematically:\n\nRow 4 has 3 and 4, missing 1 and 2.\nColumn 2 in row 4 and column 4 in row 4 need these values.\nBottom-right subgrid has 4, missing 1, 2, 3.\nRow 3 col 3, row 3 col 4, row 4 col 2, row 4 col 4 are in this subgrid.\n\nSince row 4 col 4 needs 1 or 2, and row 3 col 4 needs a value that makes column 4 complete (missing 1, 2, 3), let me check:\n\nIf row 4 col 4 = 1, then row 4 col 2 = 2\nIf row 4 col 4 = 2, then row 4 col 2 = 1\n\nBottom-left subgrid needs 1 and 4 in row 3 col 2 and row 4 col 2.\nIf row 4 col 2 = 2, then row 3 col 2 = 1 or 4. But we need 1 and 4 in this subgrid, and we already determined row 4 col 2 = 2, which contradicts the subgrid rule.\n\nSo row 4 col 2 must be 1 or 4.\nIf row 4 col 2 = 1, then row 3 col 2 = 4, and row 4 col 4 = 2.\nIf row 4 col 2 = 4, then row 3 col 2 = 1, and row 4 col 4 = 2.\n\nLet me try row 4 col 2 = 1:\nRow 4: 3 1 4 2\nRow 3 col 2 = 4: Row 3: 2 4 _ _\n\nColumn 4 now has: _, 4, _, 2 - missing 1 and 3\nRow 3 col 4 must be 1 or 3\nRow 1 col 4 must be 1 or 3\n\nRow 3: 2 4 _ _\nRow 3 is missing 1 and 3 in columns 3 and 4.\nColumn 3 has 3 and 4, missing 1 and 2.\nSo row 3 col 3 must be 1, and row 3 col 4 must be 3.\n\nRow 3: 2 4 1 3\n\nNow column 3: _, _, 1, 4 - missing 2 and 3\nRow 1 col 3 = 3 (given), so row 2 col 3 = 2\n\nColumn 4: _, 4, 3, 2 - missing 1\nSo row 1 col 4 = 1\n\nRow 1: _ _ 3 1\nRow 2: _ _ 2 4\n\nRow 1 is missing 2 and 4 in columns 1 and 2.\nRow 2 is missing 1 and 3 in columns 1 and 2.\n\nColumn 1: _, _, 2, 3 - missing 1 and 4\nSo row 1 col 1 = 4 and row 2 col 1 = 1\n\nColumn 2: _, _, 4, 1 - missing 2 and 3\nSo row 1 col 2 = 2 and row 2 col 2 = 3\n\nFinal solution:\nRow 1: 4 2 3 1\nRow 2: 1 3 2 4\nRow 3: 2 4 1 3\nRow 4: 3 1 4 2\n\n<answer>4 2 3 1\n1 3 2 4\n2 4 1 3\n3 1 4 2</answer>",

Top-left subgrid needs 1, and it can only go in position (2,1) since (1,1) would conflict with column 1 already having 3 in row 2.\n   So (2,1) = 1. But wait, row 2 already has 3,4 so it needs 1,2. Column 1 has 3, so (2,1) must be either 1, 2, or 4. Since the top-left subgrid needs 1, and (1,1) can't be 1 (would need to be 4), then (2,1) = 1.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Row 2 is \"3 4 _ _\" and needs 1,2. The first blank in row 2 is column 1, so (2,1) could be 1. Let me check if this works with the top-left subgrid constraint.\n\nActually, let me be more systematic:\n\nPosition (1,1): Row 1 needs 1,4. Column 1 needs 1,2,4. Top-left subgrid needs 1. So (1,1) could be 1 or 4.\n\nIf (1,1) = 1, then top-left subgrid is complete.

This is wrong since row 2 position 1 would be the first blank.\n\nLet me restart more carefully:\n\nRow 2 is \"3 4 _ _\", so positions (2,3) and (2,4) are blank.\nRow 2 needs 1,2 in positions (2,3) and (2,4).\n\nPosition (1,1): Can be 1 or 4 (from row and column constraints).\nPosition (1,3): Row 1 needs 1,4.

Row 2 needs 1,2, so (2,3) = 2.\nThen (2,4) = 1.\n\nRow 2 becomes \"3 4 2 1\".\n\nNow for row 3 \"_ _ _ 2\":\nColumn 1 needs 1,2 (has 3,4). Row 3 needs 1,3,4.\nSo (3,1) can be 1.\nColumn 2 needs 1,3 (has 2,4). Row 3 needs 3,4 after placing 1.\nSo (3,2) can be 3.\nColumn 3 needs 3,4 (has 1,2).

This is wrong.\n\nLet me try (1,1) = 1:\nRow 1 becomes \"1 2 _ 3\" and needs 4 in position (1,3).\nSo (1,3) = 4.\nRow 1 is \"1 2 4 3\".\n\nFor row 2 \"3 4 _ _\":\nRow 2 needs 1,2.

Row 2 is missing only 2, and it must go in column 2. So position (2,2) = 2.\n\n2. Now column 3 is missing only 2, and the only empty spot in column 3 is position (1,3). So position (1,3) = 2.\n\n3.

Column 1 needs 2, 4 in positions (3,1) and (4,1).\n\n8. Column 4 needs 2, 3. Row 3 position (3,4) and row 4 position (4,4) are the empty spots in column 4.\n\n9. Row 4 has 1, 4 and needs 2, 3. Position (4,1) and (4,4) are empty in row 4.\n\n10. If position (3,1) = 2, then position (4,1) = 4 (to complete column 1).\n    This means row 4 would have 4, 1, 4 which is impossible.\n\n11.

Missing 1, 4\nRow 2: Missing 1, 2, 3, 4\nRow 3: Has 1. Missing 2, 3, 4\nRow 4: Has 3, 4. Missing 1, 2\n\nColumn 1: Has 1. Missing 2, 3, 4\nColumn 2: Has 2, 3. Missing 1, 4\nColumn 3: Has 4. Missing 1, 2, 3\nColumn 4: Has 3. Missing 1, 2, 4\n\nTop-left 2x2: Has 2. Missing 1, 3, 4\nTop-right 2x2: Has 3. Missing 1, 2, 4\nBottom-left 2x2: Has 1. Missing 2, 3, 4\nBottom-right 2x2: Has 4. Missing 1, 2, 3\n\nLet me start filling in:\n\nLooking at row 4, column 1: needs 1 or 2. Looking at column 1, it needs 2, 3, 4. So position (4,1) could be 2.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4: needs 1 or 2. Looking at column 4, it needs 1, 2, 4. The bottom-right subgrid needs 1, 2, 3. So position (4,4) could be 1 or 2.\n\nLet me try position (4,1) = 2:\n```\n_ 2 _ 3\n_ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _\n2 3 4 _\n```\n\nNow row 4 needs only 1, so position (4,4) = 1:\n```\n_ 2 _ 3\n_ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _\n2 3 4 1\n```\n\nNow column 4 has 3, 1 and needs 2, 4. Row 1 needs 1, 4 and position (1,4) already has 3, so position (1,3) must be either 1 or 4. Since column 3 needs 1, 2, 3 and we need 4 in row 1, position (1,1) = 4 and position (1,3) = 1:\n```\n4 2 1 3\n_ _ _ _\n1 _ _ _\n2 3 4 1\n```\n\nNow column 3 needs 2, 3. Row 2 and row 3 intersect column 3. Row 3 needs 2, 3, 4 and position (3,3) could be 2 or 3. Row 2 needs 1, 2, 3, 4 and position (2,3) could be 2 or 3.\n\nLooking at the top-right subgrid, it has 1, 3 and needs 2, 4. So position (2,3) or (2,4) must be 2 and 4.\n\nColumn 4 needs 2, 4 (positions 2,4 and 3,4). Row 2 needs all numbers. Row 3 needs 2, 3, 4.\n\nIf position (2,4) = 2, then position (3,4) = 4:\n```\n4 2 1 3\n_ _ _ 2\n1 _ _ 4\n2 3 4 1\n```\n\nNow row 3 needs 3 (position 3,2 or 3,3). Column 3 needs 3 (position 2,3 or 3,3). So position (3,3) = 3:\n```\n4 2 1 3\n_ _ _ 2\n1 _ 3 4\n2 3 4 1\n```\n\nRow 3 needs 2, so position (3,2) = 2:\n```\n4 2 1 3\n_ _ _ 2\n1 2 3 4\n2 3 4 1\n```\n\nColumn 3 needs 2, so position (2,3) = 2:\n```\n4 2 1 3\n_ _ 2 2\n1 2 3 4\n2 3 4 1\n```\n\nWait, this gives us 2 twice in row 2, which is invalid. Let me reconsider.\n\nLet me try position (2,4) = 4 instead:\n```\n4 2 1 3\n_ _ _ 4\n1 _ _ 2\n2 3 4 1\n```\n\nWait, that would put 2 in position (3,4), but I already determined (4,4) = 1.

But (3,4) is 1, so (3,3) must be 4, and (4,4) must be 3.\n\nRow 3: _ _ 4 1\nRow 4: _ _ 2 3\n\nNow column 4: _ 4 1 3, so (1,4) = 2\n\nRow 1: _ _ _ 2\n\nLooking at column 3: _ 3 4 2, so (1,3) = 1\nRow 1: _ _ 1 2\n\nTop-right subgrid (rows 1-2, cols 3-4):\n```\n1 2\n3 4\n```\nThis is complete.\n\nNow for the left side:\nRow 1: _ _ 1 2 (needs 3,4)\nRow 3: _ _ 4 1 (needs 2,3)\nRow 4: _ _ 2 3 (needs 1,4)\n\nColumn 1: _ 1 _ _ (needs 2,3,4)\nColumn 2: _ 2 _ _ (needs 1,3,4)\n\nTop-left subgrid needs 1,2,3,4\nBottom-left subgrid needs 1,2,3,4\n\nFrom row 4: _ _ 2 3\nColumn 1 needs 2,3,4 and column 2 needs 1,3,4\nSo (4,1) could be 2,3,4 and (4,2) could be 1,3,4\nBut row 4 needs 1,4, so (4,1)=4 and (4,2)=1\n\nRow 4: 4 1 2 3\n\nNow column 1: _ 1 _ 4, so it needs 2,3\nColumn 2: _ 2 _ 1, so it needs 3,4\n\nRow 3: _ _ 4 1 needs 2,3\nSince column 1 needs 2,3 and column 2 needs 3,4:\nIf (3,1)=2, then (3,2)=3\nIf (3,1)=3, then (3,2)=2, but column 2 needs 3,4, so (3,2) cannot be 2\n\nTherefore: (3,1)=2 and (3,2)=3\nRow 3: 2 3 4 1\n\nNow column 1: _ 1 2 4, so (1,1)=3\nColumn 2: _ 2 3 1, so (1,2)=4\n\nRow 1: 3 4 1 2\n\n<answer>\n3 4 1 2\n1 2 3 4\n2 3 4 1\n4 1 2 3\n</answer>",
