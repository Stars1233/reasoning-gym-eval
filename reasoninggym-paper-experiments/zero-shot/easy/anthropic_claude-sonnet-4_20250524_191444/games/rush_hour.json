I need to move L first.\n- L is at (4,6)-(5,6), I can move it up: L-1 would put it at (3,6)-(4,6)\n- Position (3,6) needs to be clear for AA to exit, so this won't work.\n\nLet me try a different approach:\n- Move L down: L+1 would put L at (5,6)-(6,6)\n- Then move EE right: E+1 would put EE at (5,5)-(5,6) - but (5,6) is still occupied by L\n- Move EE left instead: E-1 would put EE at (5,3)-(5,4), but (5,3) has a wall 'x'\n\nActually, let me reread the board more carefully:\n```\n.IBBBx\nGI.JCC\nGAAJK.\nG.DDKL\nH.xEEL\nHFFF..\n```\n\nI see there's a wall at (5,3). Let me try:\n1. Move L down: L+1 (moves L from (4,6)-(5,6) to (5,6)-(6,6))\n2. Move K down: K+1 (moves K from (3,5)-(4,5) to (4,5)-(5,5))\n3. Move AA right: A+2 (moves AA from (3,3)-(3,4) to (3,5)-(3,6))\n\nWait, let me double-check positions. Looking at row 3: \"GAAJK.\"\n- G is at (3,1)\n- AA is at (3,2)-(3,3)\n- J is at (3,4)\n- K is at (3,5)\n- . is at (3,6) - this is the exit\n\nSo AA needs to move right by 3 positions to reach the exit.\n\nMoves needed:\n1. Move J somewhere to clear the path\n2. Move K somewhere to clear the path\n3. Move AA right\n\nLet me work out the sequence:\n1. J can move up or down. Looking at column 4: J is at (2,4), there's DD at (4,4). J can move up to (1,4) but BBB occupies (1,4). J can move down to (3,4) but that's where it already is. Actually, J appears to be at (2,4) based on row 2: \"GI.JCC\"\n\nLet me re-examine the board positions more carefully:\nRow 1: .IBBBx (positions 1-6)\nRow 2: GI.JCC (positions 1-6)  \nRow 3: GAAJK. (positions 1-6)\nRow 4: G.DDKL (positions 1-6)\nRow 5: H.xEEL (positions 1-6)\nRow 6: HFFF.. (positions 1-6)\n\nSo:\n- AA is at (3,2)-(3,3)\n- J is at (2,4)\n- K is at (3,5)\n\nTo move AA to position (3,6):\n1. First clear J: J can move down to (3,4), but that would block AA's path\n2. Move J up: J-1 (but (1,4) is occupied by BBB)\n3. Move BBB left: B-1 (moves BBB from (1,2)-(1,4) to (1,1)-(1,3), but (1,1) is empty so this works)\n4. Move J up: J-1 (moves J from (2,4) to (1,4))\n5. Move AA right: A+3 (moves AA from (3,2)-(3,3) to (3,5)-(3,6), but (3,5) is occupied by K)\n6. Move K down: K+1 (moves K from (3,5) to (4,5), but (4,5) is already occupied by K's bottom part)\n\nActually, K appears to be vertical spanning (3,5)-(4,5). So K+1 would move it to (4,5)-(5,5).\n\nLet me try:\n1. B-1 (move BBB left)\n2. J-1 (move J up)  \n3. K+1 (move K down)\n4. A+3 (move AA right to exit)\n\n<answer>B-1 J-1 K+1 A+3</answer>",

Wait, let me re-examine the board layout:\n\n```\n.FBBJK\n.F.IJK\nxAAI.L\nCCHI.L\nEGH...\nEGDDD.\n```\n\nActually, looking more carefully at row 2 where AA is located: \"xAAI.L\"\nAA appears to be horizontal at positions (2,1) and (2,2). Let me reanalyze:\n\nRow 2: x A A I . L\nSo AA is horizontal, occupying positions (2,1) and (2,2).\n\nFor AA to reach the exit on the right, it needs to move right. Currently there's an I car blocking it at (2,3).\n\nLet me work out the moves:\n\n1. First, I need to move the I car out of the way. I car is vertical at (1,3) and (2,3).\n2. The I car can move up or down. Looking at row 1: \".F.IJK\", there's a space at (1,2), so I can move I left.\n3. Wait, I car is vertical, it can only move up/down, not left/right.\n\nLet me look at moving I up: position (0,3) has \"J\", so I can't move I up.\nLet me look at moving I down: position (3,3) has \"H\", so I can't move I down.\n\nI need to move other cars first to create space for I.\n\nLet me try a different approach:\n1. Move L car up to create space below\n2. Then move I down\n3. Then move AA right\n\nL car is at (2,5) and (3,5). Can it move up? Position (1,5) has K, so no.\nCan it move down? Position (4,5) is empty \".\", so yes!\n\nL-2 (move L down 2 spaces)\nNow I can move I down: I+1\nNow AA can move right: AA+2\n\nWait, let me double-check the positions after L+2:\nL would be at (4,5) and (5,5), but (5,5) already has \".\" so that works.\n\nAfter I+1: I would be at (2,3) and (3,3), but (3,3) has H. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, let me be more systematic. Looking at row 3: \"CCHI.L\"\nSo H is at (3,2), not (3,3). Position (3,3) is I, and (3,4) is \".\", and (3,5) is L.\n\nSo if I move I down by 1, it would go to (2,3) and (3,3), but (3,3) already has I. That doesn't work.\n\nLet me try moving I up instead. For I to move up, position (0,3) needs to be clear. Currently it has \"J\" from \"FBBJK\". \n\nLet me try moving J first. J is vertical at (0,4) and (1,4). Can J move left? No, it's vertical. Can J move up? No, it's already at the top. Can J move down? Position (2,4) is \".\", so yes.\n\nJ+2 (move J down 2 spaces)\nThen I can move I up: I-1\nThen AA can move right: AA+2\n\n<answer>J+2 I-1 AA+2</answer>",

Move J up or down\n2. Move K up or down  \n3. Move L up or down\n4. Move M up or down\n\nLet me trace through the moves:\n\n1. J can move to row 1 (there's space): J-1\n2. K can move down to row 4: K+1\n3. L can move up to row 2: L-1\n4. M can move up to row 2: M-1\n\nWait, let me check if these moves are valid by looking at available spaces.\n\nAfter J-1: J moves from (2,3) to (1,3), but (1,3) has 'B'.

M-1 moves M up (if there's space)\n\nLooking at row 2: ..JKDD - there are empty spaces in columns 1-2\nLooking at row 4: I.EELM - there's an empty space in column 2\n\nLet me try: K+1 (move K down), L+1 (move L down), M+1 (move M down)\n\nActually, let me be more systematic:\n- Move M up: M-1\n- Move L up: L-1  \n- Move K down: K+1\n- Move J down: J+1\n\nThen AA can move right: AA+4\n\n<answer>M-1 L-1 K+1 J+1 AA+4</answer>",

D is horizontal in row 4, cols 3-4.\nD can move left (cols 1-2 in row 4 have \"H\", so blocked) or right.\nLooking at row 4: \"HDDJEE\" - D is in cols 3-4, followed by J in col 4 and EE in cols 5-6.\n\nWait, I think I misread. Let me re-examine:\nRow 4: \"HDDJEE\"\n- H in col 1\n- D in cols 2-3 (not 3-4 as I thought)\n- D in col 4 (this might be part of J)\n- J in col 4\n- EE in cols 5-6\n\nLet me re-analyze the cars more carefully:\nLooking at the pattern, J appears in rows 3-5, all in col 4.\n\nActually, let me be more systematic:\nRow 3: \"AAIJ..\"\nRow 4: \"HDDJEE\" \nRow 5: \"HFFJKx\"\n\nJ appears in col 4 across rows 3, 4, and 5, so J is indeed a vertical car.\nDD appears to be in row 4, cols 3-4, but col 4 also has J, which suggests DD is in cols 2-3.\n\nLet me reread:\nRow 4: \"HDDJEE\"\n- H: col 1\n- DD: cols 2-3  \n- J: col 4\n- EE: cols 5-6\n\nNow the moves:\n1. Move J down: J+1 (J moves from rows 3-5 to rows 4-6)\n2. Move I down: I+1 (I moves from rows 2-3 to rows 3-4)  \n3. Move AA right: AA+4 (AA moves to the exit)\n\n<answer>J+1 I+1 AA+4</answer>",

To reach the exit on the right, it needs to move right to the end of row 3.\n\nLet me trace what's blocking the path:\n- AA is in row 3, positions 1-2\n- Position (3,3) has H (vertical car)\n- Positions (3,4-5) are empty\n- Position (3,6) has K (vertical car)\n\nSo AA needs to move right, but H is blocking it at position (3,3). I need to move H first.\n\nH is a vertical car spanning rows 1-3 in column 3. To move H out of the way, I can move it up or down.\n\nLooking at H's possible moves:\n- H spans (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n- Above H at (0,3) would be off the board\n- Below H at (4,3) has C, so H cannot move down\n\nWait, let me recheck the board layout. H appears to be in column 3, rows 1-3.\n\nActually, let me be more careful about the positions:\nRow 1: BBH.J.\nRow 2: ..HxJK  \nRow 3: AAH..K\nRow 4: GCCC.K\nRow 5: GDDI..\nRow 6: EE.IFF\n\nH is in column 3, spanning rows 1-3. To clear the path for AA, I need to move H up. But there's no space above row 1.\n\nLet me try moving H down instead. Looking at row 4, column 3: there's a C there, so H cannot move down.\n\nWait, I need to look more carefully at what can move. Let me identify all the cars:\n\n- AA: horizontal in row 3, cols 1-2\n- BB: horizontal in row 1, cols 1-2  \n- H: vertical in col 3, rows 1-3\n- J: vertical in col 5, rows 1-2\n- K: vertical in col 6, rows 2-4\n- G: vertical in col 1, rows 4-5\n- CCC: horizontal in row 4, cols 2-4\n- DD: horizontal in row 5, cols 2-3\n- I: vertical in col 4, rows 5-6\n- EE: horizontal in row 6, cols 1-2\n- FF: horizontal in row 6, cols 5-6\n\nTo move AA right, I need to clear H from (3,3). Since H cannot move up (no space) or down (blocked by C), I need to move C first.\n\nCCC spans row 4, cols 2-4. If I move CCC left by 1, then H can move down.\n\nLet me try: C-1 (move CCC left by 1)\nThis would put CCC at row 4, cols 1-3. But G is at (4,1), so this won't work.\n\nLet me try moving CCC right: C+1\nThis would put CCC at row 4, cols 3-5. But K is at (4,6), and there might be conflicts.\n\nActually, let me check if CCC can move right. Looking at row 4: GCCC.K\nCCC is at positions 2-4, and position 5 is empty, position 6 has K.\nSo CCC can move right by 1: C+1\n\nAfter C+1, row 4 becomes: G.CCC K\nNow H can move down: H+1\n\nAfter H+1, the board becomes:\n```\nBB..J.\n....JK\nAA...K\nG.HCCK\nGDDHI.\nEE.IFF\n```\n\nWait, that doesn't look right.

Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, let me check the original board again more carefully:\n```\nBBH.J.\n..HxJK\nAAH..K\nGCCC.K\nGDDI..\nEE.IFF\n```\n\nCCC occupies positions (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).

Let me try moving other cars first.\n\nActually, let me try moving K up to make room: K-1\nK spans (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). Moving up by 1: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6).\nPosition (1,6) is currently empty, so this works.\n\nAfter K-1:\n```\nBBH.JK\n..HxJK\nAAH..K\nGCCC..\nGDDI..\nEE.IFF\n```\n\nNow I can move CCC right: C+2\nThis moves CCC from (4,2),(4,3),(4,4) to (4,4),(4,5),(4,6).\n\nAfter C+2:\n```\nBBH.JK\n..HxJK\nAAH..K\nG..CCC\nGDDI..\nEE.IFF\n```\n\nNow H can move down: H+1\nThis moves H from (1,3),(2,3),(3,3) to (2,3),(3,3),(4,3).\n\nAfter H+1:\n```\nBB..JK\n..HxJK\nAAH..K\nG.HCCC\nGDDI..\nEE.IFF\n```\n\nNow AA can move right: A+4\nThis moves AA from (3,1),(3,2) to (3,5),(3,6).\n\nWait, (3,6) has K. Let me double-check my moves.\n\nAfter K-1, K should be at (1,6),(2,6),(3,6). So (3,6) still has K.\n\nLet me try a different sequence. Let me move AA right step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to clear (3,3) where H is. \nTo move H down, I need to clear (4,3) where C is.\nTo move C right, I need space at (4,5) and (4,6).\n(4,5) is empty, but (4,6) has K.\n\nSo: K-1, then C+2, then H+1, then AA can move right.\n\nBut after these moves, let me check where AA can go:\nAfter H+1, positions (3,3) is clear, (3,4) and (3,5) are empty.\nBut I need to check (3,6) - after K-1, K is still at (3,6).\n\nLet me try moving K further: K-2\nThis moves K from (2,6),(3,6),(4,6) to (0,6),(1,6),(2,6).\nBut (0,6) is off the board.\n\nSo K can only move up by 1: K-1.\n\nAfter K-1, C+2, H+1:\nAA can move to (3,3),(3,4) with A+2.\nThen AA can move to (3,4),(3,5) with A+1 more.\nBut (3,6) still has K.\n\nI need to move K out of the way completely. Let me see if K can move down instead.\nOriginal K position: (2,6),(3,6),(4,6)\nMoving down: (3,6),(4,6),(5,6)\nPosition (5,6) currently has F, so K cannot move down.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I can move other cars to create more space.\n\nLet me try moving J: J-1 (up)\nJ spans (1,5),(2,5). Moving up: (0,5),(1,5).\nBut (0,5) is off the board.\n\nJ+1 (down): (2,5),(3,5).\nPosition (3,5) is currently empty, so this works.\n\nAfter J+1:\n```\nBBH...\n..HxJ.\nAAH.JK\nGCCC.K\nGDDI..\nEE.IFF\n```\n\nNow let me try: K-1, C+1, H+1\nAfter K-1: K moves to (1,6),(2,6),(3,6)\nAfter C+1: CCC moves to (4,3),(4,4),(4,5)  \nAfter H+1: H moves to (2,3),(3,3),(4,3) - but this conflicts with C at (4,3).\n\nThis still doesn't work. Let me try C+2 instead.\nAfter C+2: CCC moves to (4,4),(4,5),(4,6) - but K is at (4,6) after K-1.\n\nI think I need to move K further or find another path.\n\nActually, let me try moving AA up first, then right.\nBut AA is horizontal, so it can only move left/right, not up/down.\n\nLet me reconsider the exit. The problem says \"exit on the right\". Looking at the board, this likely means AA needs to reach the rightmost position in its row.\n\nLet me try: J+1, K-1, C+2, H+1, A+3\n\nAfter J+1: J moves from (1,5),(2,5) to (2,5),(3,5)\nAfter K-1: K moves from (2,6),(3,6),(4,6) to (1,6),(2,6),(3,6)  \nAfter C+2: CCC moves from (4,2),(4,3),(4,4) to (4,4),(4,5),(4,6) - conflicts with K at (4,6)\n\nStill doesn't work.

What if I move cars to create a clear path in a different row?\n\nActually, let me carefully re-examine what the exit means. If AA needs to exit \"on the right\", it probably means reaching position (3,6) or getting to the rightmost edge.\n\nCurrent obstacles for AA moving right:\n- H at (3,3)\n- K at (3,6)\n\nTo clear both: I need to move H and K.\n\nFor H: need to move C first\nFor K: need to move it up or down\n\nLet me try: K+1 (down), C-1 (left), H+1 (down), A+4 (right)\n\nK+1: K moves from (2,6),(3,6),(4,6) to (3,6),(4,6),(5,6)\nBut (5,6) has F, so this doesn't work.\n\nLet me try: K-1, J+2, C+3, H+1, A+4\n\nActually, let me be more systematic and try:\nK-1, C+3, H+1, A+4\n\nAfter K-1: K at (1,6),(2,6),(3,6)\nAfter C+3: CCC moves from (4,2),(4,3),(4,4) to (4,5),(4,6),(4,7) - but (4,7) is off the board\n\nC can only move right by 2 maximum: C+2 puts CCC at (4,4),(4,5),(4,6)\nBut after K-1, K is still at (3,6), and after C+2, C is at (4,6), so this conflicts.\n\nI think I need to move more cars. Let me try:\n\nJ+1, K-1, C+1, H+1, A+2\n\nAfter J+1: J at (2,5),(3,5)\nAfter K-1: K at (1,6),(2,6),(3,6)  \nAfter C+1: CCC at (4,3),(4,4),(4,5)\nAfter H+1: H at (2,3),(3,3),(4,3) - conflicts with C at (4,3)\n\nStill conflicts.

Let me try a different sequence:\n\nWhat if I move DD first to make room?\nDD is at (5,2),(5,3). \nD+2 moves DD to (5,4),(5,5)\nPosition (5,4) has I, so this doesn't work.\n\nD-1 moves DD to (5,1),(5,2)  \nPosition (5,1) has G, so this doesn't work.\n\nLet me try moving I first:\nI is at (4,4),(5,4). Wait, that's not right.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\n```\nBBH.J.\n..HxJK\nAAH..K\nGCCC.K\nGDDI..\nEE.IFF\n```\n\nRow 5: GDDI..\nSo I is at (5,4). I is vertical spanning (5,4) and (6,4).\n\nI-1 moves I to (4,4),(5,4)\nPosition (4,4) has C, so this doesn't work.\n\nI+1 moves I to (6,4),(7,4)  \nPosition (7,4) is off the board.\n\nLet me try moving FF:\nFF is at (6,5),(6,6)\nF-2 moves FF to (6,3),(6,4)\nPosition (6,3) is empty, but (6,4) has I, so this doesn't work.\n\nF-1 moves FF to (6,4),(6,5)\nPosition (6,4) has I, so this doesn't work.\n\nThis puzzle is quite constrained. Let me try a more systematic approach.\n\nThe key insight is that I need to create a clear path for AA to move right. Let me trace exactly what needs to happen:\n\n1. AA is at (3,1),(3,2) and needs to reach the right edge\n2. H blocks at (3,3)\n3. K blocks at (3,6)\n\nTo move H down, C needs to move away from (4,3).\nTo move K up, there needs to be space at (1,6).\n\nLet me try: K-1, C+2, H+1, A+3\n\nAfter K-1: K at (1,6),(2,6),(3,6)\nAfter C+2: CCC at (4,4),(4,5),(4,6) - but K is at (3,6), not (4,6) after K-1, so this should work\nAfter H+1: H at (2,3),(3,3),(4,3) - but C is now at (4,4), not (4,3), so this should work  \nAfter A+3: AA at (3,4),(3,5)\n\nBut AA still can't reach (3,6) because K is there.\n\nLet me try: K-1, C+2, H+1, K+1, A+4\n\nAfter the first 3 moves as above.\nAfter K+1: K moves from (1,6),(2,6),(3,6) to (2,6),(3,6),(4,6) - but C is at (4,6), so this doesn't work.\n\nI think the issue is that after C+2, CCC occupies (4,4),(4,5),(4,6), so K cannot move back down to (4,6).\n\nLet me try: K-1, C+1, H+1, A+2, K+1, A+2\n\nAfter K-1: K at (1,6),(2,6),(3,6)\nAfter C+1: CCC at (4,3),(4,4),(4,5)  \nAfter H+1: H at (2,3),(3,3),(4,3) - conflicts with C at (4,3)\n\nStill doesn't work.\n\nLet me try a completely different approach. What if the exit is not at (3,6) but AA just needs to move as far right as possible?\n\nLooking at row 3: AAH..K\nIf H moves away and K moves away, AA can reach positions (3,3),(3,4) and then (3,4),(3,5).\n\nLet me try: K-1, H-2, A+3\n\nAfter K-1: K at (1,6),(2,6),(3,6)\nH-2 would move H from (1,3),(2,3),(3,3) to (-1,3),(0,3),(1,3) - but negative positions are off the board.\n\nH can only move down, not up. So H+1, but that requires moving C first.\n\nLet me try one more systematic approach:\n\nJ+1, K-1, C+2, H+1, A+4\n\nAfter J+1: J at (2,5),(3,5)\nAfter K-1: K at (1,6),(2,6),(3,6)\nAfter C+2: CCC at (4,4),(4,5),(4,6) - but after K-1, K is at (3,6), and we're trying to put C at (4,6). These don't conflict.\nAfter H+1: H at (2,3),(3,3),(4,3) - but C is at (4,4), not (4,3), so this works.\nAfter A+4: AA moves from (3,1),(3,2) to (3,5),(3,6) - but K is at (3,6), so this doesn't work.\n\nI need to move K away from (3,6) after moving it to (1,6),(2,6),(3,6).\n\nActually, wait. Let me double-check the K-1 move.\nOriginal K: (2,6),(3,6),(4,6)\nAfter K-1: (1,6),(2,6),(3,6)\n\nSo K is still at (3,6). I need to move K completely out of row 3.\n\nWhat if I do K-2? \nThat would move K from (2,6),(3,6),(4,6) to (0,6),(1,6),(2,6)\nBut (0,6) is off the board.\n\nK can only move up by 1. So I need a different strategy.\n\nLet me see if there's another way. What if I move AA left first, then find a different path?\n\nA-1 moves AA from (3,1),(3,2) to (3,0),(3,1)\nBut (3,0) is off the board.\n\nAA cannot move left.\n\nLet me try moving other cars to create more space:\n\nWhat about moving BB?\nBB is at (1,1),(1,2)\nB+2 moves BB to (1,3),(1,4) - but (1,3) has H\nB+1 moves BB to (1,2),(1,3) - but (1,3) has H\n\nBB cannot move right due to H.\nB-1 moves BB to (1,0),(1,1) - but (1,0) is off the board.\n\nLet me try moving the cars in the bottom rows:\n\nEE is at (6,1),(6,2)\nE+1 moves EE to (6,2),(6,3) - position (6,3) is empty, so this works.\n\nAfter E+1:\n```\nBBH.J.\n..HxJK\nAAH..K\nGCCC.K\nGDDI..\n.EE.IFF\n```\n\nNow G can move down:\nG+1 moves G from (4,1),(5,1) to (5,1),(6,1)\n\nAfter G+1:\n```\nBBH.J.\n..HxJK\nAAH..K\n.CCC.K\nGDDI..\nGEE.IFF\n```\n\nNow C can move left:\nC-1 moves CCC from (4,2),(4,3),(4,4) to (4,1),(4,2),(4,3)\n\nAfter C-1:\n```\nBBH.J.\n..HxJK\nAAH..K\nCCC..K\nGDDI..\nGEE.IFF\n```\n\nNow H can move down:\nH+1 moves H from (1,3),(2,3),(3,3) to (2,3),(3,3),(4,3)\n\nAfter H+1:\n```\nBB..J.\n..HxJK\nAAH..K\nCCCH.K\nGDDI..\nGEE.IFF\n```\n\nWait, this puts H at (4,3) but C is at (4,3) too. This doesn't work.\n\nLet me recalculate. After C-1, CCC is at (4,1),(4,2),(4,3).\nSo (4,3) is occupied by C, and H cannot move there.\n\nI made an error. Let me try C-2:\nThis would move CCC from (4,2),(4,3),(4,4) to (4,0),(4,1),(4,2)\nBut (4,0) is off the board.\n\nSo C can only move right, not left, unless I create more space.\n\nThis is quite challenging.

          "full_model_response": "I need to analyze the board and find a way to move the red car (AA) to the exit on the right.\n\nLet me first understand the current board layout:\n```\nBBB.xK\nCCDDDK\nHAAJ..\nH..JEE\n..IFFx\nGGI...\n```\n\nThe red car AA is positioned horizontally in row 3 (HAAJ..). The exit appears to be on the right side of the board.\n\nLet me identify all vehicles and their orientations:\n- AA: horizontal, in row 3\n- BBB: horizontal, in row 1\n- CC: horizontal, in row 2\n- DDD: horizontal, in row 2\n- EE: horizontal, in row 4\n- FF: horizontal, in row 5\n- GG: horizontal, in row 6\n- H: vertical, in column 1 (rows 3-4)\n- I: vertical, in column 3 (rows 5-6)\n- J: vertical, in column 4 (rows 3-4)\n- K: vertical, in column 6 (rows 1-2)\n\nTo move AA to the right exit, I need to clear the path. Currently, AA is blocked by J on its right side.\n\nLet me work out the moves:\n\n1. First, I need to move J down to make space for AA\n2. J can move down since there's space below it\n3. Then AA can move right to the exit\n\nLet me trace through the moves:\n\n1. Move J down 2 spaces: J+2\n   This moves J from rows 3-4 to rows 5-6, but I see there's already something at row 5-6 (the board shows \"..IFFx\" and \"GGI...\"). Let me reconsider.\n\nLooking more carefully at the board:\n- J is in column 4, rows 3-4\n- Below J in column 4 are empty spaces in rows 5-6\n\nActually, let me re-examine the board more carefully:\n```\nBBB.xK  (row 1)\nCCDDDK  (row 2)\nHAAJ..  (row 3)\nH..JEE  (row 4)\n..IFFx  (row 5)\nGGI...  (row 6)\n```\n\nJ is vertical in column 4, occupying rows 3-4. To move AA right, I need to move J out of the way.\n\nJ can move down 1 space since row 5 column 4 appears to be empty (it shows \"F\" but that's in columns 4-5 for FF).\n\nWait, let me reread this more carefully. In row 5: \"..IFFx\" - this means columns 1-2 are empty, column 3 has I, columns 4-5 have FF, column 6 has x.\n\nSo J cannot move down because FF occupies column 4 in row 5.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I need to move other cars first to create space.\n\n1. Move FF left 1 space: F-1 (this moves FF from columns 4-5 to columns 3-4, but I is in column 3)\n2. Move I down 1 space: I+1 (this moves I from rows 5-6 to rows 6-7, but there's no row 7)\n\nLet me reconsider the board layout. Looking at row 6: \"GGI...\" - this suggests I is in column 3 of row 6 only, not rows 5-6.\n\nRe-examining:\n- Row 5: \"..IFFx\" means I is in column 3, FF in columns 4-5\n- Row 6: \"GGI...\" means GG in columns 1-2, I in column 3\n\nSo I is vertical in column 3, rows 5-6.\n\nNow I can plan:\n1. Move I down is not possible (no space)\n2. Move FF right 1 space: F+1 (moves FF from columns 4-5 to columns 5-6, but column 6 has x)\n\nFF cannot move right due to the wall.\n\nLet me try moving FF left:\n1. Move I up: I-1 (moves I from rows 5-6 to rows 4-5, but row 4 column 3 is empty)\n2. Then move FF left: F-1 (moves FF from columns 4-5 to columns 3-4)\n3. Then move J down: J+1 (moves J from rows 3-4 to rows 4-5)\n4. Finally move AA right: A+2 (moves AA to the exit)\n\nLet me verify this sequence:\n1. I-1: I moves from (5,3)-(6,3) to (4,3)-(5,3)\n2. F-1: FF moves from (5,4)-(5,5) to (5,3)-(5,4), but now I occupies (5,3)\n\nThis won't work. Let me try:\n1. Move GG right: G+1 (from columns 1-2 to columns 2-3, but I is in column 3)\n\nGG cannot move right due to I.\n\nLet me try moving vehicles in row 4 first:\n1. Move EE left: E-1 (from columns 5-6 to columns 4-5, but J is in column 4)\n\nLet me try moving J up:\n1. J-1: moves J from rows 3-4 to rows 2-3, but row 2 column 4 has D\n\nLooking at this more systematically:\n1. Move DDD right: D+1 (from columns 3-5 to columns 4-6, but K is in column 6)\n2. Move K down: K+1 (from rows 1-2 to rows 2-3, but row 3 column 6 is empty)\n\nActually, let me try:\n1. K+2 (move K down 2 spaces)\n2. D+1 (move DDD right 1 space)  \n3. J-1 (move J up 1 space)\n4. A+2 (move AA right 2 spaces to exit)\n\n<answer>K+2 D+1 J-1 A+2</answer>",

L-1: Move L up one space to (0,5),(1,5),(2,5) - but this puts L at (0,5) which might be out of bounds or into BB/CC area\n2. Actually, looking at row 0: x.BBCC - position (0,5) has C, so L can't move there.\n\nLet me try moving L down instead:\n1. L+1: Move L down to (2,5),(3,5),(4,5) - checking if (4,5) is free... row 4 is GGGJ.., so (4,5) is empty\n2. K+1: Move K right to (1,5),(2,5) - but (2,5) is still occupied by L\n3. This doesn't work.\n\nLet me try a different approach:\n1. K-1: Move K left to (1,3),(2,3) - but (2,3) has A\n2. This doesn't work either.\n\nI need to move other pieces first. Let me look for space:\n\nActually, let me re-examine the board. Looking at row 1: DDx.KL\n- DD is at (1,0)-(1,1)\n- x is at (1,2) \n- . is at (1,3)\n- K is at (1,4)\n- L is at (1,5)\n\nSo K is vertical spanning (1,4) and (2,4), and L is vertical spanning (1,5), (2,5), and (3,5).\n\nLet me try:\n1. L+1: Move L down one position to (2,5),(3,5),(4,5)\n2. K+1: Move K right to (1,5),(2,5) - but (2,5) is still occupied by L after the move\n3. This still doesn't work.\n\nWait, I think I need to move L further down:\n1. L+2: Move L down two positions to (3,5),(4,5),(5,5)\n2. K+1: Move K right to (1,5),(2,5)\n3. AA+2: Move AA right to (2,4),(2,5)\n\nBut wait, checking if (5,5) is available... row 5 is HHHJ.., so (5,5) is empty. Good.\nAnd (4,5) in row 4 GGGJ.. is also empty.\n\n<answer>L+2 K+1 AA+2</answer>",

Position (4,2) has J, position (4,3) has K, so D cannot move left.\n\nLet me try moving other cars to create space:\n\nJ is at (3,2) and (4,2), oriented vertically.\nK is at (3,3) and (4,3), oriented vertically.\n\nIf I move J and K up, that might create space for D to move left.\n\nBut looking at row 2: GHIAAN, positions (2,2) has I and (2,3) has A, so J and K cannot move up.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me see if I can move cars in row 3:\nRow 3: CCJK.N\n\nC is at (3,0) and (3,1), J at (3,2), K at (3,3), empty at (3,4), N at (3,5).\n\nIf I can move C left... but C is already at the leftmost positions.\n\nLet me try moving cars to create a chain reaction:\n\nActually, let me look at this more systematically. I'll move N down by first clearing space below it.\n\nLooking at the bottom rows:\nRow 4: ..JKDD  \nRow 5: .EEFF.\n\nI can move E left: E-1\nThis moves E from (5,1),(5,2) to (5,0),(5,1)\n\nAfter E-1:\n```\nGBB.LM\nGHI.LM\nGHIAAN\nCCJK.N\n..JKDD\nEEF.F.\n```\n\nNow F can move left: F-1\nThis moves F from (5,3),(5,4) to (5,2),(5,3)\n\nAfter F-1:\n```\nGBB.LM\nGHI.LM\nGHIAAN\nCCJK.N\n..JKDD\nEEFF..\n```\n\nNow D can move right: D+1\nThis moves D from (4,4),(4,5) to (4,5),(4,6) - but wait, there's no position (4,6).\n\nLet me reconsider. D can move down now: D+1\nThis moves D from (4,4),(4,5) to (5,4),(5,5)\n\nAfter D+1:\n```\nGBB.LM\nGHI.LM\nGHIAAN\nCCJK.N\n..JK..\nEEFF.DD\n```\n\nWait, that's not right. D is horizontal, so +1 means right, not down.\n\nLet me be more careful about orientation:\n- D is horizontal (DD in row 4), so it moves left/right\n- D+1 means move right 1 space\n\nBut D cannot move right because it's already at the right edge.\nD-1 would move it left, but positions (4,2) and (4,3) have J and K.\n\nLet me try moving J and K first.\nJ is vertical, spanning (3,2) and (4,2)\nK is vertical, spanning (3,3) and (4,3)\n\nJ-1 would move J up, but (2,2) has I.\nK-1 would move K up, but (2,3) has A.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the board again, maybe I can move other cars to create space:\n\nLet me try moving cars in the top rows first:\nL is at (0,4),(1,4) and (0,5),(1,5) - wait, that's not right.\n\nLet me re-examine the board character by character:\n\nRow 0: G B B . L M (positions 0,1,2,3,4,5)\nRow 1: G H I . L M  \nRow 2: G H I A A N\nRow 3: C C J K . N\nRow 4: . . J K D D\nRow 5: . E E F F .\n\nSo:\n- L is at (0,4) and (1,4), oriented vertically\n- M is at (0,5) and (1,5), oriented vertically  \n- AA is at (2,3) and (2,4), oriented horizontally\n- N is at (2,5) and (3,5), oriented vertically\n\nFor AA to reach the exit at (2,5), N needs to move down.\nN can move down if (4,5) and (5,5) are clear.\nCurrently (4,5) has D and (5,5) is empty.\n\nSo I need to move D out of (4,5).\nD is at (4,4) and (4,5), horizontal.\nD can move left if (4,2) and (4,3) are clear, but they have J and K.\n\nI need to move J and K first.\nJ is at (3,2) and (4,2), vertical.\nK is at (3,3) and (4,3), vertical.\n\nJ can move down if (5,2) is clear. Currently (5,2) has E.\nK can move down if (5,3) is clear. Currently (5,3) has F.\n\nSo I need to move E and F first.\n\nE is at (5,1) and (5,2), horizontal.\nF is at (5,3) and (5,4), horizontal.\n\nE can move left: E-1 (to positions (5,0) and (5,1))\nF can move right: F+1 (to positions (5,4) and (5,5))\n\nLet me execute this plan:\n\n1. E-1: Move E left\n2. F+1: Move F right  \n3. J+1: Move J down\n4. K+1: Move K down\n5. D-2: Move D left 2 spaces\n6. N+1: Move N down\n7. AA+1: Move AA right\n\n<answer>E-1 F+1 J+1 K+1 D-2 N+1 AA+1</answer>",
