      "best_full_model_response": "I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks on 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\nWith 4 pegs available, I can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is more efficient than the classic 3-peg solution. The strategy is to:\n1. Move the top k disks from source to auxiliary peg using all 4 pegs\n2. Move the remaining n-k disks from source to destination using 3 pegs\n3. Move the k disks from auxiliary to destination using all 4 pegs\n\nFor 7 disks, the optimal k is 4. So I'll:\n1. Move top 4 disks (1,2,3,4) from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using all pegs\n2. Move bottom 3 disks (5,6,7) from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using pegs 2,3,4\n3.

          "full_model_response": "I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks on 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\nWith 4 pegs available, I can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is more efficient than the classic 3-peg solution. The strategy is to:\n1. Move the top k disks from source to auxiliary peg using all 4 pegs\n2. Move the remaining n-k disks from source to destination using 3 pegs\n3. Move the k disks from auxiliary to destination using all 4 pegs\n\nFor 7 disks, the optimal k is 4. So I'll:\n1. Move top 4 disks (1,2,3,4) from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using all pegs\n2.

The strategy involves:\n1. Moving the top k disks to an auxiliary peg\n2. Moving the remaining n-k disks to the destination using 3 pegs\n3. Moving the k disks from auxiliary to destination\n\nFor 7 disks, the optimal k is 4. So I'll:\n1. Move top 4 disks (1-4) from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n2.

          "full_model_response": "I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\nWith 4 pegs available, I can use the Reve's algorithm (multi-peg Tower of Hanoi). The optimal strategy is to:\n1. Move the top k disks from source to auxiliary peg\n2. Move the remaining (n-k) disks from source to destination using 3 pegs\n3. Move the k disks from auxiliary to destination\n\nFor 7 disks, the optimal k is 4. So I'll:\n1. Move top 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (using all 4 pegs)\n2. Move bottom 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 (using Pegs 2, 3, 4)\n3. Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 (using all 4 pegs)\n\nLet me work through this step by step:\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to

          "full_model_response": "I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n\nWith 4 pegs available, I can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is more efficient than the classic 3-peg solution. The strategy is to:\n1. Move the top k disks from source to auxiliary peg using all 4 pegs\n2. Move the remaining n-k disks from source to destination using 3 pegs\n3. Move the k disks from auxiliary to destination using all 4 pegs\n\nFor 6 disks, the optimal k is 3. So I'll:\n1. Move top 3 disks (1,2,3) from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using all pegs\n2. Move bottom 3 disks (4,5,6) from Peg 3 to Peg 4 using pegs 2,3,4\n3.

          "full_model_response": "I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4.\n\nWith 4 pegs available, I can use the multi-peg algorithm which is more efficient than the classic 3-peg solution. The strategy is to:\n1. Move the top k disks from source to auxiliary peg using all 4 pegs\n2. Move the remaining (n-k) disks from source to destination using 3 pegs\n3. Move the k disks from auxiliary to destination using all 4 pegs\n\nFor 6 disks, the optimal k is 4, so I'll:\n1. Move top 4 disks (1,2,3,4) from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using all pegs\n2.

Move the 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 (using Peg 1 as auxiliary)\n\nLet me work through this systematically:\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 7 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n</answer>",
