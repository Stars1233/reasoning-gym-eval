Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. That's only 1 true statement, contradicting T = 4.\n\nIf T = 5: F = 2. Statement 2 would be true (F \u2264 2). Statement 6 would be true (5 is prime). Statement 7 would be false (2 is not composite). Statement 1 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false. That's only 2 true statements, contradicting T = 5.\n\nIf T = 6: F = 1.

For Statement 5 to be true, we need exactly one of S3 or S4 to be true, but both are false. So Statement 5 is false. This gives us at most 0 true statements so far, but we assumed T = 1. Contradiction.\n\nCase T = 2: \n- Statement 3 is true (T = 2)\n- Statement 4 is false (T \u2260 0)\n- Statement 5 is true (exactly one of S3, S4 is true)\n- Statement 6 is true (2 is prime)\n- Statement 7 is true (F = 5, but 5 is prime, not composite, so Statement 7 is false)\n- Statement 1 is false (T = 2 < 4)\n- Statement 2 is false (F = 5 > 3)\n\nSo we have S3, S5, S6 true and S1, S2, S4, S7 false. That's T = 3, not T = 2. Contradiction.\n\nCase T = 3:\n- Statement 6 is true (3 is prime)\n- F = 4, so Statement 7 is true (4 is composite)\n- Statement 1 is false (T = 3 < 4)\n- Statement 2 is true (F = 4 > 3 is false, so \"at most 3\" is false... wait, F = 4 > 3, so Statement 2 is false)\n- Statement 3 is false (T = 3 \u2260 2)\n- Statement 4 is false (T = 3 \u2260 0)\n- Statement 5: Since both S3 and S4 are false, Statement 5 is false\n\nSo we have S6, S7 true and S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 false. That's T = 2, not T = 3. Contradiction.\n\nCase T = 4:\n- Statement 1 is true (T = 4 \u2265 4)\n- Statement 2 is true (F = 3 \u2264 3)\n- Statement 3 is false (T = 4 \u2260 2)\n- Statement 4 is false (T = 4 \u2260 0)\n- Statement 5 is false (both S3 and S4 are false)\n- Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime)\n- Statement 7 is false (F = 3 is prime, not composite)\n\nSo we have S1, S2 true and S3, S4, S5, S6, S7 false. That's T = 2, not T = 4. Contradiction.\n\nCase T = 5:\n- Statement 6 is true (5 is prime)\n- F = 2, Statement 7 is false (2 is prime, not composite)\n- Statement 1 is true (T = 5 \u2265 4)\n- Statement 2 is true (F = 2 \u2264 3)\n- Statement 3 is false (T = 5 \u2260 2)\n- Statement 4 is false (T = 5 \u2260 0)\n- Statement 5 is false (both S3 and S4 are false)\n\nSo we have S1, S2, S6 true and S3, S4, S5, S7 false. That's T = 3, not T = 5. Contradiction.\n\nCase T = 6 or T = 7: Similar analysis shows contradictions.\n\nLet me reconsider T = 2 more carefully:\nIf exactly 2 statements are true, then Statement 3 (\"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true\") must be one of them. For Statement 5 to be true, exactly one of S3 or S4 must be true. Since S3 is true and we need S4 false, Statement 5 could be true. That would give us S3 and S5 as true statements, making T = 2 consistent.\n\nLet me verify: S3 true, S5 true, others false.\n- S1: False (T = 2 < 4)\n- S2: False (F = 5 > 3)\n- S3: True (T = 2)\n- S4: False (T \u2260 0)\n- S5: True (S3 true, S4 false)\n- S6: True (2 is prime) - but this would make T = 3\n- S7: False (F = 5 is prime, not composite)\n\nThis still leads to contradiction.

Statement 5 would be false since both S3 and S4 are false. Statement 1 (T \u2265 3) is false. Statement 2 (T \u2265 5) is false. Statement 7: F = 5, which is prime, not composite, so S7 is false. This gives us 1 true statement (S6), contradicting T = 2.\n\nIf T = 3: Statement 6 would be true (3 is prime). Statement 1 would be true (T \u2265 3). Statement 2 is false (T \u2265 5). Statement 3 is false (T \u2260 1). Statement 4 is false (T \u2260 6). Statement 5 is false (both S3 and S4 are false). Statement 7: F = 4, which is composite, so S7 is true.

Statement 2 would be true (T \u2265 5). Statement 3 is false (T \u2260 1). Statement 4 is false (T \u2260 6). Statement 5 is false (both S3 and S4 are false).
