(not divisible)\n55835 \u00f7 11 = 5075.91... (not divisible)\n55835 \u00f7 13 = 4294.23... (not divisible)\n\nLet me use the Euclidean algorithm instead:\n\nGCD(16250, 55835):\n55835 = 3 \u00d7 16250 + 7085\n16250 = 2 \u00d7 7085 + 2080\n7085 = 3 \u00d7 2080 + 845\n2080 = 2 \u00d7 845 + 390\n845 = 2 \u00d7 390 + 65\n390 = 6 \u00d7 65 + 0\n\nSo GCD(16250, 55835) = 65\n\nNow dividing both by 65:\n16250 \u00f7 65 = 250\n55835 \u00f7 65 = 859\n\nLet me verify: 250 \u00d7 65 = 16250 \u2713\n859 \u00d7 65 = 55835 \u2713\n\nNow I need to check if 250/859 can be simplified further by finding GCD(250, 859):\n\n250 = 2 \u00d7 5\u00b3\n859 is prime (let me verify: \u221a859 \u2248 29.3, so I need to check divisibility by primes up to 29)\n859 \u00f7 7 = 122.71... (not divisible)\n859 \u00f7 11 = 78.09... (not divisible)\n859 \u00f7 13 = 66.08... (not divisible)\n859 \u00f7 17 = 50.53... (not divisible)\n859 \u00f7 19 = 45.21... (not divisible)\n859 \u00f7 23 = 37.35... (not divisible)\n859 \u00f7 29 = 29.62...

Let me check if 499 has small factors:\n499 is odd, so not divisible by 2\n4 + 9 + 9 = 22, not divisible by 3\nDoesn't end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5\n499 \u00f7 7 = 71.28... not exact\n499 \u00f7 11: 499 = 11 \u00d7 45 + 4, so not divisible by 11\n499 \u00f7 13: 499 = 13 \u00d7 38 + 5, so not divisible by 13\n499 \u00f7 17: 499 = 17 \u00d7 29 + 6, so not divisible by 17\n499 \u00f7 19: 499 = 19 \u00d7 26 + 5, so not divisible by 19\n\nWait, let me check 499 \u00f7 23:\n23 \u00d7 21 = 483\n499 - 483 = 16\nSo 499 is not divisible by 23.\n\nSince I need to check up to \u221a499 \u2248 22.3, and I've checked all primes up to 23, 499 appears to be prime.\n\nSo 12475 = 5\u00b2 \u00d7 499\n\nNow I can find the GCD:\n5100 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5\u00b2 \u00d7 17\n12475 = 5\u00b2 \u00d7 499\n\nThe common factors are just 5\u00b2, so GCD(5100, 12475) = 25.\n\nTherefore:\n$\\frac{5100}{12475} = \\frac{5100 \u00f7 25}{12475 \u00f7 25} = \\frac{204}{499}$\n\nLet me verify this is in lowest terms by checking if GCD(204, 499) = 1:\n204 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 17\n499 is prime\n\nSince 499 is prime and doesn't equal 2, 3, or 17, GCD(204, 499) = 1.\n\n<answer>$\\frac{204}{499}$</answer>",
