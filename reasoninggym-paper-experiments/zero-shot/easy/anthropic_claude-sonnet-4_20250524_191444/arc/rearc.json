Identify the background color (the most frequent number in the grid)\n2. Find the rectangular region that contains all the non-background numbers\n3. Extract that region and output it as a smaller grid\n\nLet me verify this by examining the specific regions:\n\nExample 1: The non-1 numbers form a 4x4 region from rows 5-8, columns 8-11\nExample 2: The non-0 numbers form a 4x4 region from rows 1-6, columns 0-4 (but the output is rearranged)\nExample 3: The non-1 numbers form a 4x4 region from rows 6-9, columns 7-10\n\nWait, let me look more carefully at the transformation. It seems like the output is not just a direct extraction, but there might be some rearrangement or specific positioning rule.\n\nLooking more carefully at Example 1:\n- Input region (rows 5-8, cols 8-11): The pattern with 9s at top, 7s on left, 5s on right, 8s scattered, 2s at bottom\n- Output: Shows the same elements but in a specific 4x4 arrangement\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The output seems to be extracting a 4x4 bounding box that contains all the non-background elements, and this bounding box is output directly.\n\nFor the test input:\n- Background color: 7 (most frequent)\n- Non-7 elements: 9 (at 2,1 and 3,2), 8 (at 3,5 and 3,6), 0 (at 4,4 and 5,4), 2 (at 4,7 and 5,7), 4 (at 6,5 and 6,6)\n- Bounding box: rows 2-6, columns 1-7 would be too large\n\nLet me find the minimal 4x4 region that captures the pattern:\nLooking at rows 3-6, columns 4-7:\nRow 3: 7 8 8 7\nRow 4: 0 7 7 2  \nRow 5: 0 7 7 2\nRow 6: 7 4 4 7\n\nBut I need to include the 9s as well. Let me look at the broader pattern and see if there's a 4x4 region that includes the key elements.\n\nActually, looking at the examples again, it seems like the output captures a 4x4 region where the non-background elements are positioned. Let me extract the 4x4 region from rows 3-6, columns 4-7:\n\n<answer>\n7 8 8 7\n0 7 7 2\n0 7 7 2\n7 4 4 7\n</answer>",

The interior sections contain patterns\n\nLet me trace through Example 1:\n- Input is 10\u00d78, output is 6\u00d74\n- Row 1 (separator): all 5s at positions 1 and 8\n- Row 8 (separator): all 5s at positions 1 and 8\n- This creates a central section from rows 2-7, columns 2-7\n\nLooking at the pattern more carefully:\n\nThe rule appears to be:\n1. Identify the rectangular sections bounded by separator rows/columns\n2. Extract the interior content of these sections\n3. The corner values from the original grid become part of the output\n4. The interior patterns are transformed and arranged in the output\n\nFor the test input:\n```\n7 1 9 9 9 9 1 6\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n9 1 0 9 0 9 1 9\n9 1 9 0 9 0 1 9\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n5 1 9 9 9 9 1 8\n```\n\n- Separator rows: rows 1 and 4 (all 1s)\n- This creates a central section in rows 2-3, columns 2-6\n- Corner values: 7 (top-left), 6 (top-right), 5 (bottom-left), 8 (bottom-right)\n- Interior section contains: \n  ```\n  0 9 0 9\n  9 0 9 0\n  ```\n\nFollowing the pattern from the examples, the output should be:\n\n<answer>\n7 6\n5 8\n</answer>",
