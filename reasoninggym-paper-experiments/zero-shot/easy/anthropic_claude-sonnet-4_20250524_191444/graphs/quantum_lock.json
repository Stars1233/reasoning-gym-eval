Let me try a different pattern.\n\nLet me try:\n- Press B: 0 - 3 = -3 (light becomes green)\n- Press A: -3 + 3 = 0 (light becomes red)\n\nThat's not helpful.

Let me try to get to 12, then think about how to get 35:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press C: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 (green)\n\nFrom 24, I need to get to 35. That's +11.\nI can add 2 when green: 24 + 2 = 26 (red)\nThen I need to toggle to green to add more, but multiplying by 3 gives 78.\n\nActually, let me try to get 38 and subtract 3:\nI need 38. Let me see if I can get close to 38/3 \u2248 12.67.\n\nWait, let me try to get 13 and multiply by 3 to get 39, then subtract 3 to get 36, then subtract 3 again to get 33, then add 2 to get 35.\n\nTo get 13:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press C: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 (green)\n\nFrom 24, I need to get to 13. That's 24 - 11. I can subtract 3 at a time when green.\n24 - 3 = 21 (red)\nI can't subtract when red.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me see if I can get to 12 and work from there:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press C: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 (green)\n\nFrom 24, I can subtract to get closer to 12:\n24 - 3 = 21 (red)\n21 \u00d7 3 = 63 (green)\nThis is getting bigger.\n\nLet me try:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press C: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 (green)\n- Press B: 24 - 3 = 21 (red)\n- Press C: 21 \u00d7 3 = 63 (green)\n\nThis is getting too big.\n\nActually, let me try to work backwards more systematically:\n35 = 33 + 2 (need to add 2 when green)\n33 = 11 \u00d7 3 (need to multiply 11 by 3)\n\nSo I need to get 11, then multiply by 3 to get 33, then add 2 to get 35.\n\nTo get 11:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press C: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 (green)\n\nFrom 24, I need to get to 11. That's 24 - 13.\nI can subtract 3 when green: 24 - 3 = 21 (red)\nI can't subtract when red, so I need to use C: 21 \u00d7 3 = 63 (green)\nThis is going in the wrong direction.\n\nLet me try a completely different approach. Let me try to get smaller numbers first:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press A: Can't use when red\n\nI need to toggle the light. Let me try:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press A: Can't use when red\n\nLet me try this sequence:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press C: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 (green)\n- Press A: 24 + 2 = 26 (red)\n- Press C: 26 \u00d7 3 = 78 (green)\n- Press B: 78 - 3 = 75 (red)\n- Press C: 75 \u00d7 3 = 225 (green)\n\nThis is way too big.\n\nActually, let me try to be more systematic. Let me try to get to 38 and then subtract 3:\n38 = ? \u00d7 3. 38/3 \u2248 12.67, so I can't get 38 by multiplying an integer by 3.\n\nBut maybe I can get close: 12 \u00d7 3 = 36, then add 2 to get 38.\nSo: get 12, multiply by 3 to get 36, add 2 to get 38, subtract 3 to get 35.\n\nTo get 12:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press C: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 (green)\n\nFrom 24, I need to get to 12. That's 24 - 12 = 12. I can subtract 3 four times.\n24 - 3 = 21 (red)\nI can't subtract when red, so I use C: 21 \u00d7 3 = 63 (green)\nThis doesn't work.\n\nLet me try yet another approach. Maybe I should try to get to 4 first:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press C: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 (green)\n\nFrom 24, I need to get to 4. That's 24 - 20. I can subtract 3 at a time: 20/3 \u2248 6.67, so about 7 subtractions. But I need to manage the light.\n\nActually, let me try this:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press A: 6 + 2 = 8 (red)\n- Press C: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 (green)\n- Press B: 24 - 3 = 21 (red)\n- Press C: 21 \u00d7 3 = 63 (green)\n- Press B: 63 - 3 = 60 (red)\n- Press C: 60 \u00d7 3 = 180 (green)\n\nThis is getting way too big.\n\nLet me try a much simpler approach. Let me try to get to 3 first:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press B: 6 - 3 = 3 (red)\n\nNow I have 3 (red). Let me continue:\n- Press C: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (green)\n- Press A: 9 + 2 = 11 (red)\n- Press C: 11 \u00d7 3 = 33 (green)\n- Press A: 33 + 2 = 35 (red)\n\nThat works! Let me verify:\nStarting: 0 (red)\n- Press C: 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 (green)\n- Press A: 0 + 2 = 2 (red)\n- Press C: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (green)\n- Press B: 6 - 3 = 3 (red)\n- Press C: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 (green)\n- Press A: 9 + 2 = 11 (red)\n- Press C: 11 \u00d7 3 = 33 (green)\n- Press A: 33 + 2 = 35 (red)\n\nYes! This gives me 35.\n\n<answer>C \u2192 A \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 A \u2192 C \u2192 A</answer>",
