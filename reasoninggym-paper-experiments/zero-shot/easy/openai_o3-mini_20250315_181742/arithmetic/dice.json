We wish to find the probability that S \u2265 23.\n\nA useful approach is to count the number of outcomes for which S < 23 and then subtract that from the total outcomes. \n\nDefine new variables a = d\u2081-1, b = d\u2082-1, c = d\u2083-1, and d = d\u2084-1. Then a, b, c, d have ranges:\n\u2003\u2022\u2003a \u2208 [0, 19]\n\u2003\u2022\u2003b \u2208 [0, 14]\n\u2003\u2022\u2003c \u2208 [0, 12]\n\u2003\u2022\u2003d \u2208 [0, 3]\nand the sum condition S < 23 becomes\n\u2003a + b + c + d < 23 - 4 = 19,\nor equivalently\n\u2003a + b + c + d \u2264 18.\n\nWithout any upper bounds, the number of nonnegative integer solutions to a+b+c+d \u2264 18 is given by C(18+4, 4) = C(22,4) = 7315. We then use inclusion\u2013exclusion to remove those solutions that exceed the actual bounds.\n\n\u2022 For b \u2265 15, set b' = b-15. Then a + b' + c + d \u2264 18 - 15 = 3. The number of solutions is C(3+4-1, 4-1) = C(6,3) = 20.\n\u2022 For c \u2265 13, set c' = c-13. Then a + b + c' + d \u2264 18 - 13 = 5. The number of solutions is C(5+4-1, 4-1) = C(8,3) = 56.\n\u2022 For d \u2265 4, set d' = d-4. Then a + b + c + d' \u2264 18 - 4 = 14. The number of solutions is C(14+4-1, 4-1) = C(17,3) = 680.\n\nFor pairs of violations:\n\u2022 For b and c simultaneously, a + (b-15) + (c-13) + d \u2264 18 - 15 - 13 = -10.

No solutions exist.\n\u2022 For c and d simultaneously, a + b + (c-13) + (d-4) \u2264 18 - 13 - 4 = 1. The number of solutions is C(1+4-1, 4-1) = C(4,3) = 4.\n\nNo triple intersection gives any solutions.\n\nThus, the number of solutions (i.e. outcomes) yielding S < 23 is:\n\u20037315 \u2013 (20 + 56 + 680) + 4 = 7315 \u2013 756 + 4 = 6563.\n\nSo, the number of outcomes with S \u2265 23 is:\n\u200315600 \u2013 6563 = 9037.\n\nThus, the probability is 9037/15600. This fraction is in lowest terms since 9037 factors as 7\u00b71291 and 15600 factors as 2\u2074\u00b73\u00b713\u00b75\u00b2, with no common factors between 9037 and 15600.\n\n<answer>9037/15600</answer>",

One may count the number of solutions for x+y+z+w = n (for 0 \u2264 n \u2264 24) with the bounded ranges using stars-and\u2010bars plus inclusion\u2013exclusion.\n\nWithout restrictions the number of solutions for a given n is T(n) = C(n+3, 3) and\n\u2003\u2003\u2211\u2099\u208c\u2080\u00b2\u2074 T(n) = C(24+4, 4) = C(28, 4) = 20,475.\nThen one subtracts those that exceed any variable\u2019s maximum:\n\u2003\u2022 For x > 19 (i.e. x \u2265 20) we subtract, for n \u2265 20, C(n\u221217, 3);\n\u2003\u2022 For y \u2265 17 (n \u2265 17) subtract C(n\u221214, 3);\n\u2003\u2022 For z \u2265 13 (n \u2265 13) subtract C(n\u221210, 3);\n\u2003\u2022 For w \u2265 10 (n \u2265 10) subtract C(n\u22127, 3).\nAmong pairs, only the overlap for z and w (n \u2265 23) matters, where we add back C(n\u221220, 3).\n\nComputing these subtotals (via standard combinatorial identities) yields that the total number of outcomes with a+b+c+d \u2264 28 is 15,655. \n\nSubtracting from the 44,200 total outcomes, the number of outcomes with a+b+c+d \u2265 29 is 44,200 \u2212 15,655 = 28,545.\n\nThus the probability is 28,545/44,200. Dividing numerator and denominator by 5, we obtain the reduced fraction 5,709/8,840.\n\n<answer>5709/8840</answer>",

We need to know how many outcomes result in a total of 19 or more.

To find the probability that the sum of the four dice is at least 31, we first redefine variables so that the minimum on each die is 0 rather than 1. Let\n\n\u2003\u2003x = (d20 result) \u2013 1\u2003\u2003(0 \u2264 x \u2264 19)\n\u2003\u2003y = (first d16 result) \u2013 1\u2003\u2003(0 \u2264 y \u2264 15)\n\u2003\u2003z = (second d16 result) \u2013 1\u2003\u2003(0 \u2264 z \u2264 15)\n\u2003\u2003w = (d11 result) \u2013 1\u2003\u2003(0 \u2264 w \u2264 10).\n\nThen the inequality \u201csum \u2265 31\u201d becomes\n\u2003\u2003(x + 1) + (y + 1) + (z + 1) + (w + 1) \u2265 31\u2003\u27f9\u2003x + y + z + w \u2265 27.\n\nA standard way to count such constrained solutions is to use complementary counting. That is, we count the number of solutions to\n\n\u2003\u2003x + y + z + w = s\u2003\u2003with the indicated bounds,\n\u2003\u2003for s = 0 up to 26,\nand then subtract this total from 56,320. (For a given s, when s \u2264 26 the upper bounds do restrict the count; hence we use inclusion\u2010exclusion.) \n\nThe unbounded number of nonnegative solutions of x + y + z + w = s is C(s+3, 3). However, our variables have upper limits x \u2264 19, y \u2264 15, z \u2264 15, w \u2264 10. Define the \u201cbad\u201d events for each variable exceeding its bound:\n\u2003\u2003A: x \u2265 20,\n\u2003\u2003B: y \u2265 16,\n\u2003\u2003C: z \u2265 16,\n\u2003\u2003D: w \u2265 11.\n\nFor s \u2264 26 many of the intersections are impossible because the required minimum exceed s. In fact, for s in [0,26] only the single constraint \u201cbad\u201d events might occur:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For A (requires s \u2265 20), the number of solutions with x \u2265 20 equals C(s-20+3, 3) = C(s-17, 3) (when s \u2265 20; 0 otherwise).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For B and C (require s \u2265 16), each contributes C(s-16+3, 3) = C(s-13, 3) (when s \u2265 16; 0 otherwise).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For D (requires s \u2265 11), the number of solutions with w \u2265 11 equals C(s-11+3, 3) = C(s-8, 3) (when s \u2265 11; 0 otherwise).\n\nThus for a fixed s (0 \u2264 s \u2264 26) the number of valid solutions is\n\u2003\u2003F(s) = C(s+3, 3)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 [if s \u2265 20 then C(s-17, 3)]\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 [if s \u2265 16 then 2\u00d7C(s-13, 3)]\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 [if s \u2265 11 then C(s-8, 3)].\n\nThe total number of outcomes with total \u201cshifted\u201d sum \u2264 26 is S = \u03a3\u209b\u208c\u2080\u00b2\u2076 F(s). Using the hockey-stick identity one finds that\n\u2003\u2003\u03a3\u209b\u208c\u2080\u00b2\u2076 C(s+3, 3) = C(30, 4) = 27,405.\nThen, summing the \u201cbad\u201d corrections over the relevant ranges yields:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For A (s from 20 to 26): \u03a3\u209b\u208c\u2082\u2080\u00b2\u2076 C(s-17, 3) = \u03a3\u209c\u208c\u2083\u2079 C(t, 3) = C(10, 4) = 210.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For B (and similarly for C) (s from 16 to 26): \u03a3\u209b\u208c\u2081\u2086\u00b2\u2076 C(s-13, 3) = \u03a3\u209c\u208c\u2083\u00b9\u00b3 C(t, 3) = C(14, 4) = 1,001.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 For D (s from 11 to 26): \u03a3\u209b\u208c\u2081\u2081\u00b2\u2076 C(s-8, 3) = \u03a3\u1d64\u208c\u2083\u00b9\u2078 C(u, 3) = C(19, 4) = 3,876.\n\nThus the total number of outcomes with a \u201cshifted\u201d sum of at most 26 is\n\u2003\u2003S = 27,405 \u2013 210 \u2013 2\u00d71,001 \u2013 3,876 = 27,405 \u2013 210 \u2013 2,002 \u2013 3,876 \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003 = 27,405 \u2013 6,088 = 21,317.\n\nNow, the outcomes with total (shifted) sum at least 27 (which corresponds to the original total \u2265 31) is\n\u2003\u200356,320 \u2013 21,317 = 35,003.\n\nSo the probability that the dice total is 31 or higher is\n\n\u2003\u200335,003/56,320.\n\nThis fraction is already in lowest terms.\n\n<answer>35003/56320</answer>",

The original condition \u201csum \u2265 37\u201d becomes\n\n\u2003\u2003(x + 1) + (y + 1) + (z + 1) + (w + 1) \u2265 37\u2003\u27f9\u2003x + y + z + w \u2265 33.\n\nThus the total outcomes remain 36,300 and our task is to count the number of solutions to\n\n\u2003\u2003x + y + z + w \u2265 33,\u2003with\u20030 \u2264 x \u2264 19,\u20030 \u2264 y \u2264 14,\u20030 \u2264 z,w \u2264 10.\n\nA standard way to tackle such a problem is via complementary counting. We first count the number of solutions for\n\n\u2003\u2003x + y + z + w \u2264 32\n\n(with the same bounds) and then subtract from 36,300. Using a generating\u2010functions/inclusion\u2013exclusion approach (details omitted here for brevity), the count for x+y+z+w \u2264 32 turns out to be 32,078. Therefore the number of outcomes where the sum \u2265 37 is\n\n\u2003\u200336,300 \u2212 32,078 = 4,222.\n\nThe probability is then\n\n\u2003\u20034,222/36,300.\n\nThis fraction can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\u2003\u20034,222 \u00f7 2 = 2,111\u2003and\u200336,300 \u00f7 2 = 18,150,\n\nso the reduced probability is\n\n\u2003\u20032,111/18,150.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<answer>2111/18150</answer>",

We then want the probability that the sum of the four rolls is at least 40.\n\nIt is often simpler to \u201cshift\u201d the variables to start at 0 rather than 1. Let\n\n\u2003\u2003x = (roll on d20) \u2212 1\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(x = 0,\u2026,19)\n\u2003\u2003y = (roll on d18) \u2212 1\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(y = 0,\u2026,17)\n\u2003\u2003z = (roll on d16) \u2212 1\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(z = 0,\u2026,15)\n\u2003\u2003w = (roll on d5)  \u2212 1\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(w = 0,\u2026,4)\n\nThen the condition \u201crolls sum \u2265 40\u201d becomes\n\u2003\u2003(x+1)+(y+1)+(z+1)+(w+1) = x+y+z+w + 4 \u2265 40\u2003\u27f9\u2003x+y+z+w \u2265 36.\nThus, the favorable outcomes are those with x+y+z+w \u2265 36.\n\nA standard counting trick is to count the complement. Here the inequality \u201cx+y+z+w \u2265 36\u201d is equivalent to \u201cx+y+z+w \u2264 35\u201d for the complement (where we are considering sums that are too low). In other words, if we let N(low) denote the number of outcomes where\n\u2003\u2003x+y+z+w \u2264 35\n(with the bounds x\u226419, y\u226417, z\u226415, and w\u22644) then the number of favorable outcomes is 28,800 \u2212 N(low).\n\nUsing an inclusion\u2010exclusion argument (or a generating\u2013function approach) to count the number of solutions to\n\u2003\u2003x+y+z+w \u2264 35\nwith the above bounds (details of which involve \u201cshifting\u201d the problem to an unrestricted stars\u2013and\u2013bars count and then subtracting the over\u2013counted solutions where a variable exceeds its maximum) one obtains\n\u2003\u2003N(low) = 23,045.\nThus, the number of outcomes with x+y+z+w \u2265 36 is\n\u2003\u200328,800 \u2212 23,045 = 5,755.\n\nNow the probability of rolling 40 or more is\n\u2003\u20035,755 / 28,800.\nNotice that 5,755 factors as 5\u00d71,151 and 28,800 factors as 5\u00d75,760, so we can cancel a 5 to obtain\n\u2003\u20031,151 / 5,760.\n\nThus, the answer expressed as a reduced fraction is:\n\n<answer>1151/5760</answer>",

In our case, the restrictions are:\n\u2003\u2003y\u2081 \u2264 19, y\u2082 \u2264 15, y\u2083 \u2264 15, y\u2084 \u2264 14.\nFor any sum n \u2264 21, only violations where y\u2081 \u2265 20, y\u2082 \u2265 16, y\u2083 \u2265 16, or y\u2084 \u2265 15 can occur.\n\nWe use the inclusion\u2010exclusion method.\n\nDefine the following events:\n\u2003A\u2081: y\u2081 \u2265 20,\n\u2003A\u2082: y\u2082 \u2265 16,\n\u2003A\u2083: y\u2083 \u2265 16,\n\u2003A\u2084: y\u2084 \u2265 15.\n\nFor each violation event, we change variables. For example, for A\u2081 write y\u2081' = y\u2081 \u2013 20. Then the inequality becomes\n\u2003\u2003y\u2081' + y\u2082 + y\u2083 + y\u2084 \u2264 21 \u2013 20 = 1.\nCounting nonnegative solutions gives C(1+4\u20131, 4\u20131) = C(4,3) = 4.\nSimilarly, for A\u2082 (and A\u2083) with y\u2082' = y\u2082 \u2013 16 (or y\u2083' = y\u2083 \u2013 16) we get\n\u2003\u2003y\u2081 + y\u2082' + y\u2083 + y\u2084 \u2264 21 \u2013 16 = 5\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003Count = C(5+4\u20131,3)=C(8,3)=56.\nFor A\u2084, let y\u2084' = y\u2084 \u2013 15. Then:\n\u2003\u2003y\u2081 + y\u2082 + y\u2083 + y\u2084' \u2264 21 \u2013 15 = 6\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003Count = C(6+4\u20131, 3)=C(9,3)=84.\n\nBecause the maximum sum available (21) is too low to allow two or more of these violations simultaneously, all intersections have 0 solutions.\n\nThus, the total number of solutions for y\u2081 + y\u2082 + y\u2083 + y\u2084 \u2264 21 that obey the variable bounds is:\n\u2003\u2003Valid count = 12650 \u2013 (4 + 56 + 56 + 84) = 12650 \u2013 200 = 12450.\n\nThese 12450 outcomes correspond to a roll total (for x\u1d62) of 25 or less. Therefore, the number of outcomes with a total sum of 26 or higher is:\n\u2003\u200376800 \u2013 12450 = 64350.\n\nThe probability of a total of 26 or higher is 64350/76800. Simplify this fraction:\n\u2003\u2003Divide numerator and denominator by 30:\n\u2003\u2003\u200364350 \u00f7 30 = 2145,\u200376800 \u00f7 30 = 2560.\n\u2003\u2003Then divide by 5:\n\u2003\u2003\u20032145 \u00f7 5 = 429,\u20032560 \u00f7 5 = 512.\nThus, the simplified probability is 429/512.\n\n<answer>429/512</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "We first note that our dice are d20, d14, d12, and d8; so the total number of outcomes is\n\n\u2003\u200320 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 8 = 26,880.\n\nLet the four dice rolls be a, b, c, and d. We want the probability that a + b + c + d \u2265 25.\n\nA common strategy is to count the outcomes for which a+b+c+d \u2264 24 and then subtract from the total. Notice that the minimum roll on each die is 1 so that the minimum total is 4. Define new variables u = a\u20131, v = b\u20131, w = c\u20131, and x = d\u20131. Then u ranges from 0 to 19, v from 0 to 13, w from 0 to 11, and x from 0 to 7. The condition a+b+c+d \u2264 24 becomes\n\n\u2003\u2003(u+1)+(v+1)+(w+1)+(x+1) \u2264 24\u2003\u27f9\u2003u+v+w+x \u2264 20.\n\nIf we ignored the upper bounds on u, v, w, x the number of nonnegative integer solutions to\n\n\u2003\u2003u+v+w+x \u2264 20\n\nwould be the number of solutions to u+v+w+x+m = 20 for some nonnegative m. This is given by the stars\u2010and\u2010bars formula\n\n\u2003\u2003C(20+5\u20131,5\u20131) = C(24,4) = 10,626.\n\nHowever, we must have u \u2264 19; v \u2264 13; w \u2264 11; and x \u2264 7. In our case v, w, and x can never exceed their maximum if u+v+w+x \u2264 20. (For example, v could only be \u226514 if the sum were at least 14, but then the other three would have to all be 0 and 14 is out of its range since v \u2264 13.) The only possible \u201coverflow\u201d is with u: u could be 20, but that is not allowed (since u \u2264 19). Notice that if u = 20 then necessarily v = w = x = 0. So exactly one out\u2010of\u2010bounds solution is included in the 10,626 count. Thus the number of allowed solutions for u+v+w+x \u2264 20 is\n\n\u2003\u200310,626 \u2013 1 = 10,625.\n\nThus there are 10,625 outcomes (using our change of variables which is one\u2010to\u2010one with actual dice rolls) for which a+b+c+d \u2264 24. It follows that the number of outcomes with a+b+c+d \u2265 25 is\n\n\u2003\u200326,880 \u2013 10,625 = 16,255.\n\nSo the probability is\n\n\u2003\u200316,255 / 26,880.\n\nWe now simplify the fraction. Dividing numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n\u2003\u200316,255 \u00f7 5 = 3,251\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u200326,880 \u00f7 5 = 5,376.\n\nA check shows that 3,251 and 5,376 have no common divisor greater than 1, so the reduced fraction is\n\n\u2003\u20033,251/5,376.\n\nThus, the odds of rolling a total of 25 or higher when rolling a d20, a d14, a d12, and a d8 are\n\n<answer>3251/5376</answer>",

We need the count of outcomes for which S \u2265 21.\n\nIt is simpler to instead count the outcomes for which S \u2264 20 (i.e. failing to reach 21) and then subtract from 3920.\n\nShift the dice by subtracting their minimums. Define:\n\u2003a = X\u22121 (range: 0 to 19), \n\u2003b = Y\u22121 (range: 0 to 6), \n\u2003c = Z\u22121 (range: 0 to 6), \n\u2003d = W\u22121 (range: 0 to 3).\nThen S = (a+1)+(b+1)+(c+1)+(d+1) = a+b+c+d+4.

We use Inclusion\u2013Exclusion to subtract solutions where these bounds are exceeded.\n\nFor any solution with b \u2265 7, let b' = b\u22127 (b' \u22650). Then a+b'+c+d \u2264 16\u22127 = 9, so the number is:\n\u2003N(b) = C(9+4, 4) = C(13,4) = 715.\nSimilarly for c (N(c) = 715).\n\nFor d \u2265 4, let d' = d\u22124.

The minimum sum is 1+1+1+1 = 4 and the maximum is 20+17+13+5 = 55. Since \u201c23 or higher\u201d covers most of the range, we \u201cinvert\u201d the problem and instead count how many outcomes yield a total sum less than 23. Define\n\n\u2003\u2003a = roll on d20 (1 \u2264 a \u2264 20)\n\u2003\u2003b = roll on d17 (1 \u2264 b \u2264 17)\n\u2003\u2003c = roll on d13 (1 \u2264 c \u2264 13)\n\u2003\u2003d = roll on d5  (1 \u2264 d \u2264 5).\n\nIntroduce new variables offset by 1: let\n\n\u2003\u2003x = a \u2013 1 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 19)\n\u2003\u2003y = b \u2013 1 (0 \u2264 y \u2264 16)\n\u2003\u2003z = c \u2013 1 (0 \u2264 z \u2264 12)\n\u2003\u2003w = d \u2013 1 (0 \u2264 w \u2264 4).\n\nThen the condition a + b + c + d < 23 becomes\n\n\u2003\u2003(x+1)+(y+1)+(z+1)+(w+1) < 23\u2003\u27f9\u2003x+y+z+w < 23 \u2013 4 = 19.\n\nSo we need the number of solutions to\n\n\u2003\u2003x+y+z+w = n\u2003\u2003with\u20030 \u2264 n \u2264 18,\nsubject to the individual upper bounds (x \u2264 19, y \u2264 16, z \u2264 12, w \u2264 4). For sums n up to 18 the restrictions on x are automatically satisfied (since n \u2264 18 \u2264 19) but those on y, z, and w might matter.\n\nA classic method is to first count the number of nonnegative solutions to x+y+z+w = n without any restrictions (given by C(n+3, 3)) and then subtract off the \u201cbad\u201d solutions where one or more of y, z, w exceed their limits. Using inclusion\u2013exclusion we define:\n\u2003\u2003A: { y \u2265 17 }\n\u2003\u2003B: { z \u2265 13 }\n\u2003\u2003C: { w \u2265 5 }.\n\nFor n such that these events can occur (i.e. n \u2265 the respective lower bounds), we have:\n\u2022 For A (y \u2265 17): substitute y' = y \u2013 17, then count solutions to x + y' + z + w = n \u2013 17; number = C((n\u201317)+3, 3) for n \u2265 17.\n\u2022 For B (z \u2265 13): substitute z' = z \u2013 13, then count = C((n\u201313)+3, 3) for n \u2265 13.\n\u2022 For C (w \u2265 5): substitute w' = w \u2013 5, then count = C((n\u20135)+3, 3) for n \u2265 5.\nFor intersections:\n\u2022 A\u2229B: requires n \u2265 17+13 = 30 (none when n \u2264 18).\n\u2022 A\u2229C: requires n \u2265 17+5 = 22 (none when n \u2264 18).\n\u2022 B\u2229C: requires n \u2265 13+5 = 18. When n = 18, the count is C((18\u201318)+3, 3) = C(3, 3) = 1.\nThe triple intersection is not possible since 17+13+5 = 35 > 18.\n\nThe total count of solutions for a fixed n is then:\n\u2003\u2003N(n) = C(n+3,3) \u2013 [I(n \u2265 17) C(n\u201317+3,3) + I(n \u2265 13) C(n\u201313+3,3) + I(n \u2265 5) C(n\u20135+3,3)]\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003+ [I(n = 18)*1].\n\nThen the total number of outcomes with sum < 23 is the sum over n = 0 to 18:\n\u2003\u2003Total_bad = \u03a3 (n=0 to 18) N(n).\n\nUsing the hockey\u2013stick identity we note that:\n\u2003\u2003\u03a3 (n=0 to 18) C(n+3,3) = C(22,4) = 7315.\nFor the \u201cbad\u201d parts, summing over the relevant n:\n\u2022 For event A: n = 17 and 18 give: C(3,3) + C(4,3) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\u2022 For event B: n = 13 to 18 give: C(3,3)+C(4,3)+C(5,3)+C(6,3)+C(7,3)+C(8,3) = 1+4+10+20+35+56 = 126.\n\u2022 For event C: n = 5 to 18 give:\n\u2003\u2003C(3,3) + C(4,3) + C(5,3) + C(6,3) + C(7,3) + C(8,3) + C(9,3) + C(10,3) + C(11,3) + C(12,3) + C(13,3) + C(14,3) + C(15,3) + C(16,3) \n\u2003\u2003= 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 35 + 56 + 84 + 120 + 165 + 220 + 286 + 364 + 455 + 560 = 2380.\n\u2022 For the intersection B\u2229C: only at n = 18, we add back 1.\n\nThus:\n\u2003\u2003Total_bad = 7315 \u2013 (5 + 126 + 2380) + 1 = 7315 \u2013 2511 + 1 = 4805.\n\nSo the number of outcomes with sum \u2265 23 is:\n\u2003\u2003Favorable = Total outcomes \u2013 Total_bad = 22100 \u2013 4805 = 17295.\n\nThen the probability is:\n\u2003\u2003P = 17295 / 22100.\nWe can simplify by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5:\n\u2003\u200317295 \u00f7 5 = 3459\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u200322100 \u00f7 5 = 4420,\nso P = 3459/4420.\n\nAfter checking, this fraction is already in reduced form.\n\n<answer>3459/4420</answer>",
