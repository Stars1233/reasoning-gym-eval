If this were true, then all statements, including Statement 3 itself, would be false, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since we've established that Statement 3 is false, Statement 5's truthfulness depends on the truthfulness of Statement 4.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false. This means that 3 statements are true. Given that Statement 3 is false, and if Statement 4 is true, we need to consider the truthfulness of the other statements under this condition.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that at least 7 of these 7 statements are true. Given that we've already determined Statement 3 is false, Statement 1 cannot be true because not all statements can be true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 2 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true (meaning exactly 4 statements are false), then Statement 2 is false because it contradicts the condition of exactly 4 false statements.\n\n## Step 6: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. If exactly 4 statements are false (as per Statement 4 being true), then 3 statements are true. The number 3 is indeed a prime number, supporting the possibility of Statement 6 being true under this condition. The number of false statements, 4, is not a prime number but a composite number, which aligns with Statement 7.\n\n## Step 7: Assess the validity of Statement 5 given the conditions\nSince Statement 3 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 4 needs to be true. This creates a scenario where we have to assess the truthfulness of the remaining statements under the condition that exactly 4 statements are false.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the number of possible solutions\nGiven the constraints and the analysis above, we need to find a combination that satisfies all true statements without contradiction. Statement 3 is false. If Statement 4 is true, then Statements 1 and 2 must be false because they contradict the conditions set by Statement 4. Statement 5 could be true if Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 could be true because 3 is a prime number. Statement 7 could also be true because 4 is a composite number. This gives us a potential scenario where Statements 4, 5, 6, and 7 could be true, and Statements 1, 2, and 3 are false, satisfying the condition of exactly 4 false statements and 3 true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Thus, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since we've established that Statement 3 is false, Statement 5's truthfulness depends on the truthfulness of Statement 4.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements must be true. Given that Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 could potentially be true if the conditions it sets are met.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that at least 7 of these 7 statements are true. For this to be true, all statements must be true, which contradicts the findings from Statement 3 and the potential truth of Statement 4. Thus, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 2 of these 7 statements are false. This means that at least 5 statements must be true. Given that Statement 3 is false and Statement 1 cannot be true, Statement 2's claim seems plausible but needs further examination in the context of other statements.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible numbers of true statements that are prime from 1 to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are numbers with more than two factors. From 1 to 7, the composite numbers are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 8: Combining Information\nGiven that Statement 3 is false, and considering the constraints of the other statements, we need to find a combination that satisfies all conditions. Statement 1 is false because not all statements can be true. Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 4. If Statement 4 is true (meaning exactly 4 statements are false), then Statement 5 could be true, which would mean 3 statements are true. This aligns with Statement 6 if the number of true statements is a prime number (in this case, 3). Statement 7 would also be true if the number of false statements (4) is composite.\n\n## Step 9: Identifying Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the necessity for consistency across all statements, we look for scenarios where the statements can logically coexist without contradiction. Statement 4 being true allows for exactly 4 false statements, which satisfies Statement 7 (since 4 is composite). Statement 6 is satisfied if the number of true statements is prime (3 true statements in this scenario). Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 2 is also satisfied because having 3 true statements means at most 4 are false, which indirectly aligns with its condition when considering the total number of statements.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nConsidering all constraints and the elimination of impossible scenarios, the only feasible scenario that does not lead to a contradiction involves Statement 4 being true, which sets the stage for other statements' truth values. This leads to a specific distribution of true and false statements that can satisfy all given conditions without paradox.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since we've established that Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 can only be true if Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' If Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements must be true (since there are 7 statements in total). This means Statement 4 itself counts as one of the true statements, so there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating the Truthfulness of Statements 1 and 2\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true,' which cannot be true since we've already established that at least one (Statement 3) is false.

This means we have two possibilities: either exactly 5 statements are true (Statement 3 is true) or exactly 3 statements are true (Statement 4 is true).\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

The only consistent scenario under the constraints provided, particularly considering Statement 5 and the prime requirement, is having 3 true statements (which would be Statements 4, 5, and 6, given their conditions), but this setup contradicts Statement 1. Thus, we look for a scenario that fits all given constraints without contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluating for Consistency Across All Statements\nGiven the strict conditions and upon re-evaluation, it appears the analysis missed aligning all statements perfectly due to the complexity of their interrelations. The critical insight lies in Statement 5, which dictates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, and the prime and composite conditions.

However, 2 is a prime number, not a composite number, which contradicts Statement 7.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluating the Scenario Where Statement 4 Is True\nIf Statement 4 is true (exactly 4 false statements, meaning 3 true statements), this contradicts the requirement of at least 5 true statements from Statement 1 and the prime number condition from Statement 6 (since 3 is a prime number but does not satisfy the \"at least 5 true\" condition from Statement 1).\n\n## Step 13: Conclusion\nGiven the conditions, the only feasible scenario under initial consideration seems to be where exactly 5 statements are true, satisfying Statements 1, 3, 5, and 6. However, this scenario does not satisfy Statement 7 (the number of false statements being composite). The contradiction arises from the interplay of these statements, particularly with Statement 7 requiring a composite number of false statements, which does not align with having exactly 5 true statements (and thus 2 false, a prime number). Therefore, we must consider if there's a misinterpretation in the steps regarding the satisfaction of all conditions simultaneously.\n\n## Step 14: Re-evaluation\nUpon closer inspection, the critical insight lies in recognizing that Statement 7 (the number of false statements is a composite number) cannot be satisfied if we have exactly 5 true statements (leaving 2 false, which is prime). However, if we consider the possibility of having exactly 6 true statements (which satisfies Statement 6 since 6 is not a prime outcome but could fit other conditions), this would mean 1 statement is false. Yet, 1 is not composite, creating a contradiction with Statement 7.\n\n## Step 15: Finalizing the Thought Process\nGiven the constraints, the solution must satisfy all true statements without contradicting any. The analysis reveals a complex interplay where satisfying one condition might violate another, particularly around the number of true and false statements being prime or composite.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This scenario aligns with Statement 1 (at least 5 true) and could potentially satisfy Statement 6 (5 is a prime number).\n- Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) would be satisfied if there are 2 false statements (since 2 is not composite, this doesn't fit) or if the interpretation allows for the number of false statements to be considered under a different context, it still poses a challenge.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the Number of Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the analysis, the key is to find a scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction. Statement 3 being true (exactly 5 true statements) seems like a central point of consideration because it directly addresses the number of true statements, which can then be used to evaluate the truthfulness of other statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Given that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply the same outcome (5 true statements and 2 false statements), they are essentially saying the same thing, making Statement 5's condition inherently satisfied if either 3 or 4 is true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. This means the possible numbers of false statements are 4 or 6, implying 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 8: Combining the Information\nFrom Statement 3 and Statement 4, we have a scenario where exactly 5 statements are true, which satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2. Statement 5 is also satisfied because it allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true. For Statement 6, having 5 true statements satisfies it since 5 is a prime number. For Statement 7, having 2 false statements (which is not composite) does not directly satisfy it, but since we are looking for the number of possible solutions and given the constraints, we need to see which combinations are feasible.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Feasibility\nGiven the constraints, especially from Statement 3 and Statement 4, which both suggest 5 true statements, and considering Statement 6 which allows for 5 true statements (a prime number), we have to evaluate if there's a combination that fits all given statements.\n\n## Step 10: Checking for Consistency\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be false because Statement 5 says at least one of them must be true. If either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true, which aligns with the conditions of Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6. However, Statement 7 poses a problem because 2 (the number of false statements if 5 are true) is not a composite number, it's a prime number.\n\n## Step 11: Resolving the Paradox\nThe only way to satisfy all conditions, including Statement 7, is to find a scenario where the number of false statements is indeed composite. However, our analysis shows that the statements lead to a fixed number of true and false statements, limiting the variability.\n\n## Step 12: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints, especially with Statement 6 requiring a prime number of true statements and Statement 7 requiring a composite number of false statements, and considering the implications of Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5, we find that the scenario where exactly 5 statements are true (satisfying Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) leaves us with a conflict regarding Statement 7.

This implies that at least 4 of the statements must be true, providing a lower bound that complements Statement 1.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then exactly 2 statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that exactly 5 statements are true, mirroring the claim of Statement 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' However, Statements 3 and 4 essentially say the same thing (5 true and 2 false), making them equivalent in outcome. Thus, if one is true, the other must also be true, which contradicts Statement 5 unless Statement 5 itself is false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the number of true statements could be any of these, but given the constraints from other statements, we need to find which of these primes (if any) satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.

Statement 5's truthfulness is dependent on the exclusivity of Statements 3 and 4, but since they essentially convey the same outcome, Statement 5's claim of exclusivity is problematic. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime, and Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 requires at least 2 true statements.\n- Statement 2 requires at most 3 false statements (thus at least 4 true statements).\n- Statements 3 and 4 suggest exactly 5 true and 2 false statements.\n- Statement 5 is problematic as it suggests an exclusivity that does not apply due to the equivalent nature of Statements 3 and 4.\n- Statement 6 limits true statements to prime numbers.\n- Statement 7 limits false statements to composite numbers.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nConsidering all constraints, the only scenario that fits all given statements without contradiction (except for the inherent contradiction in Statement 5 due to the nature of Statements 3 and 4) is having exactly 5 true statements and 2 false statements. This satisfies the prime requirement for true statements (5 is prime) and the composite requirement for false statements (4 is composite, but we have 2 false, which is prime, indicating a potential issue with satisfying all statements perfectly due to the constraints provided).\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the conditions provided by the statements, especially considering the prime and composite requirements and the specific claims of Statements 3 and 4, suggest a narrow path for satisfaction. The critical insight comes from recognizing the limitations and potential contradictions within the set of statements, particularly how Statement 5's claim of exclusivity between Statements 3 and 4 is inherently flawed due to their equivalent outcomes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means that either 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This statement is always true because you cannot have more than 7 false statements out of 7 statements. It implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then 2 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 5 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (5 true and 2 false), this statement implies that only one of these conditions can be true, but given their equivalence, it's a bit redundant. However, it's crucial for determining the truthfulness of other statements.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Relevant prime numbers here could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the possible numbers of true statements (out of 7 statements).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. For 7 statements, the possible numbers of false statements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Composite numbers among these are 4 and 6.\n\nGiven these statements, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **If Statement 3 is true**, then exactly 5 statements are true, and 2 are false. This would mean Statement 4 is also true, which contradicts Statement 5. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true without violating the conditions set by Statement 5.\n\n- **If Statement 4 is true**, then exactly 2 statements are false, and 5 are true. This aligns with the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true but not both, as stated in Statement 5.\n\nConsidering Statement 6, the number of true statements being a prime number:\n- If 2 statements are true, this satisfies the prime condition, but it contradicts Statement 1.\n- If 3 statements are true, this also satisfies the prime condition but again contradicts Statement 1.\n- If 5 statements are true, this satisfies both the prime condition and Statement 1.\n- If 7 statements are true, this satisfies the prime condition but makes Statement 7 false since 0 false statements are not composite.\n\nConsidering Statement 7, the number of false statements being a composite number:\n- 4 false statements (3 true) do not satisfy Statement 1.\n- 6 false statements (1 true) do not satisfy Statement 1.\n\nGiven these constraints:\n- The only scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction is having **5 true statements and 2 false statements**. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 6 true is not met, but this is the closest scenario without contradiction), aligns with Statement 4, satisfies Statement 5 (since only one of Statement 3 or 4 can be true), satisfies Statement 6 (5 is a prime number), and satisfies Statement 7 (2 is not composite, but this is a necessary compromise given the constraints; however, this indicates a potential oversight in the initial analysis regarding composite numbers and the specific distribution of truth values).\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the conditions provided lead to a realization that the analysis must strictly adhere to the logical implications of each statement, necessitating a correction:\n\nThe correct approach to solving this involves recognizing the constraints imposed by each statement and identifying any potential contradictions or necessary conditions. Given the complexity and the interdependence of the statements, the solution hinges on finding a set of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation:\n- **Statement 1** dictates at least 6 true statements.\n- **Statement 6** requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n- **Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be composite.\n\nThe only prime number of true statements that satisfies Statement 1 and could potentially satisfy the other conditions is 7 (since 7 is prime and having 7 true statements would mean 0 false statements, which does not satisfy the composite requirement for false statements). However, having 7 true statements contradicts the requirement for the number of false statements to be composite (since 0 is not considered composite).\n\nThus, upon careful consideration and adhering strictly to the format required for the answer, the analysis provided leads to an evaluation of the conditions and their implications on the possible number of solutions.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Since there are only 7 statements in total, this implies that at most all statements can be false, which is a given. However, it also implies that the number of false statements can be 0, meaning all statements can be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.

Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. Since we have 7 statements, if 6 are true (as per Statement 1's minimum requirement), then only 1 statement is false, which does not satisfy the condition of being composite.\n\n## Step 8: Considering the Implications of Statement 6 and Statement 7 Together\nFor Statement 6 to be true, we need a prime number of true statements, which could be 7 if all statements are true. However, Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. If all statements are true, then there are 0 false statements, which is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating the Possibility of All Statements Being True\nGiven the analysis, if all statements are true, it satisfies Statement 1 (at least 6 true), Statement 2 (at most 7 false, which is 0 in this case), Statement 6 (7 true statements, which is prime), but it does not satisfy Statement 7 (0 false statements is not composite). Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true as per Statement 5, and given our scenario, neither needs to be true for the conditions to hold, but this creates a conflict because if all statements are true, then Statement 5 is also true, which means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 should be true, not both, but in the scenario where all are true, Statement 5's condition is technically met by the truth of the other statements, not the falsity of 3 or 4.\n\n## Step 10: Reconciling the Statements\nThe only way for all statements to potentially align is if we consider the implications of each being true or false carefully. However, given the constraints, especially from Statements 1, 6, and 7, and the logical inconsistencies they create with Statements 3, 4, and 5, we must look for a scenario that satisfies all conditions without direct contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the need for consistency across all statements, the key lies in Statement 1's requirement for at least 6 true statements and Statement 6's requirement for the number of true statements to be prime. The only prime number that satisfies Statement 1's condition within the context of 7 statements is 7 itself. However, this creates a problem with Statement 7, as 0 false statements are not composite. Thus, we are looking for a scenario where all statements can be true without violating their individual conditions, which seems impossible given the direct contradictions between the statements regarding the number of true and false statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

However, this direct approach leads to a misunderstanding in reconciliation with Statement 7's requirement for composite false statements.\n- Reevaluating, if we strictly follow Statement 6 and Statement 7, and considering the constraints:\n- A prime number of true statements (2, 3, 5, 7) and a composite number of false statements (4, 6), the only scenario that fits without contradicting other statements directly is having 3 true statements and 4 false statements. However, this does not align with the initial analysis of Statement 1 requiring at least 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Correcting the Approach\nGiven the complexity and the oversight in Step 9, let's correct the approach by directly assessing the compatibility of statements:\n- Statement 1 requires at least 6 true statements.\n- Statement 2 is always true since it says at most 7 statements are false, which is a given.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, and both contradict Statement 1.\n- Statement 5 indicates only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite.\n\n## Step 11: Final Analysis\nGiven the constraints and correcting the oversight:\n- The only way for all conditions to be potentially satisfied without direct contradiction is to have a scenario where Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 can align. However, upon careful examination, it's clear that satisfying all statements simultaneously with their specific conditions (especially with Statement 1 requiring at least 6 true statements and Statement 7 requiring a composite number of false statements) leads to a logical contradiction when trying to fit into the prime and composite requirements.\n\n## Step 12: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the strict requirements and the analysis above, the solution must fit all given statements without contradiction. However, the analysis has led to a complex web of potential contradictions and misunderstandings in reconciling all statements. The key lies in identifying a set of statements that can all be true without contradicting each other, considering the prime and composite requirements, and the specific claims of each statement.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means that either 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This statement is always true because you cannot have more than 7 false statements out of 7 statements. It implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then 2 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 5 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (5 true and 2 false), this statement implies that only one of these conditions can be true, but given their equivalence, it's a bit redundant. However, it's crucial for determining the truthfulness of other statements.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Relevant prime numbers here could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the possible numbers of true statements (out of 7 statements).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. For 7 statements, the possible numbers of false statements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Composite numbers among these are 4 and 6.\n\nGiven these statements, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **If Statement 3 is true**, then exactly 5 statements are true, and 2 are false. This would mean Statement 4 is also true, which contradicts Statement 5. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true without violating the conditions set by Statement 5.\n\n- **If Statement 4 is true**, then exactly 2 statements are false, and 5 are true. This aligns with the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true but not both, as stated in Statement 5.\n\nConsidering Statement 6, the number of true statements being a prime number:\n- If 2 statements are true, this satisfies the prime condition, but it contradicts Statement 1.\n- If 3 statements are true, this also satisfies the prime condition but again contradicts Statement 1.\n- If 5 statements are true, this satisfies both the prime condition and Statement 1.\n- If 7 statements are true, this satisfies the prime condition but makes Statement 7 false since 0 false statements are not composite.\n\nConsidering Statement 7, the number of false statements being a composite number:\n- 4 false statements (3 true) do not satisfy Statement 1.\n- 6 false statements (1 true) do not satisfy Statement 1.\n\nGiven these constraints:\n- The only scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction is having **5 true statements and 2 false statements**. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 6 true is not met, but this is the closest scenario without contradiction), aligns with Statement 4, satisfies Statement 5 (since only one of Statement 3 or 4 can be true), satisfies Statement 6 (5 is a prime number), and satisfies Statement 7 (2 is not composite, but this is a necessary compromise given the constraints; however, this indicates a potential oversight in the initial analysis regarding composite numbers and the specific distribution of truth values).\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the conditions provided lead to a realization that the analysis must strictly adhere to the logical implications of each statement, necessitating a correction:\n\nThe correct approach to solving this involves recognizing the constraints imposed by each statement and identifying any potential contradictions or necessary conditions. Given the complexity and the interdependence of the statements, the solution hinges on finding a set of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation:\n- **Statement 1** dictates at least 6 true statements.\n- **Statement 6** requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n- **Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be composite.\n\nThe only prime number of true statements that satisfies Statement 1 and could potentially satisfy the other conditions is 7 (since 7 is prime and having 7 true statements would mean 0 false statements, which does not satisfy the composite requirement for false statements). However, having 7 true statements contradicts the requirement for the number of false statements to be composite (since 0 is not considered composite).\n\nThus, upon careful consideration and adhering strictly to the format required for the answer, the analysis provided leads to an evaluation of the conditions and their implications on the possible number of solutions.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Consistency Across Statements\n- Statements 3 and 4 are consistent with each other but contradict the possibility of other numbers of true statements being correct.\n- Statement 5 is automatically true if either 3 or 4 is true because they convey the same information.\n- Statement 6 allows for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements, which overlaps with the conditions of other statements.\n- Statement 7 allows for 4 or 6 false statements, meaning 3 or 1 true statements, which seems to contradict most other statements directly.\n\n## Step 9: Finding Overlapping Truth Conditions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 allows for 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 2 allows for 6 or 7 true statements.\n- Statements 3 and 4 specify exactly 4 true statements.\n- Statement 6 allows for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\nThe only condition that satisfies all possible true statements without contradiction, considering Statement 5's condition that either 3 or 4 is true (but they essentially say the same thing), is having exactly 4 true statements, as it satisfies Statement 1, and indirectly supports the condition of Statement 5 without contradicting Statement 6 directly, given its prime number condition.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluating Statement 7's Impact\nStatement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. With exactly 4 true statements, there are 3 false statements, which contradicts Statement 7 since 3 is not a composite number. Thus, our initial consideration must align with the possibility that allows for a composite number of false statements, which would be 4 false statements (as per Statement 4's implication), fitting the composite requirement.\n\n## Step 11: Reconciling Statements for a Solution\nGiven the constraints and the aim for consistency:\n- Exactly 4 true statements satisfy Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n- This also means 3 false statements, which does not satisfy Statement 7 directly since 3 is prime, not composite.\n- However, the condition of Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) and the prime number of true statements from Statement 6 can be satisfied with a different distribution that fits all given statements without direct contradiction.\n\n## Step 12: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements, the key is finding a scenario where all can be true without contradiction. Given the analysis, the direct specification by Statements 3 and 4, supported by Statement 1's flexibility and the prime condition of Statement 6, suggests a specific distribution of true and false statements. However, the exact number of solutions that satisfy all given conditions, especially considering the constraints around prime and composite numbers and the specific claims of truthfulness, requires identifying a scenario where all statements can coexist truthfully.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means the number of true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 1 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of true statements can be 6 or 7, since having 0 false statements means all are true, and having 1 false statement means 6 are true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true. This directly specifies the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false. This means that 4 statements are true, as 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that exactly 4 statements are true, they essentially say the same thing about the number of true statements, making this statement about the exclusivity between two statements that actually convey the same information regarding the truth count.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible number of true statements according to this statement can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies the number of false statements can be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements can be 3 or 1, respectively.\n\n## Step 8: Combine the Information\n- From Statement 1, true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- From Statement 2, true statements can be 6 or 7.\n- From Statement 3, true statements are exactly 4.\n- From Statement 4, true statements are exactly 4.\n- From Statement 5, either Statement 3 or 4 is true, implying 4 true statements, but given they say the same thing about the number of true statements, this doesn't add new constraints on the number of true statements.\n- From Statement 6, true statements can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- From Statement 7, true statements can be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 9: Look for Overlapping Truth Conditions\nThe only condition that satisfies all given constraints without contradiction is having exactly 4 true statements, as it aligns with Statements 1, 3, 4, and does not directly contradict the others when considering the specific question of how many solutions are possible based on these constraints.\n\n## Step 10: Determine Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and focusing on the question of the number of possible solutions rather than the truth of individual statements, we see that having exactly 4 true statements is the central overlapping condition. However, we must consider if this satisfies all statements without causing a paradox or contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate for Contradictions and Paradoxes\n- If exactly 4 statements are true, Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 cannot be true because if exactly 4 are true, then 3 are false, which contradicts \"at most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true (but not both) is a condition, and they both convey the same outcome.\n- Statement 6 is not true because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because 3 false statements make the number of false statements (3) not a composite number in the context usually defined for such puzzles (though 3 is not composite, this step requires acknowledging the specific definitions and common understandings in logic puzzles).\n\n## Step 12: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the above analysis, the only scenario that fits without causing a direct contradiction based on the initial interpretation is having exactly 4 true statements. However, upon closer examination, the conditions provided create a complex web of truths and falsehoods that seem to hinge on the interpretation of \"at most 1 false\" and the nature of prime and composite numbers in relation to the statements' truthfulness. The critical insight lies in recognizing which statements can coexist as true without violating the conditions set forth by the others, particularly considering the constraints around the number of true and false statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

If this were the case, then all statements, including Statement 3 itself, would be true. However, this creates a problem when considering the other statements, especially those that contradict it or provide alternative conditions.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 2 of the 7 statements are false. This means 5 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then we have to consider which statements could be false to satisfy this condition.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the Implications of Statement 5\nStatement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This creates a direct conflict between Statements 3 and 4, meaning only one scenario can be considered true at a time.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 1\nStatement 1 states that at least 3 of these 7 statements are true. This is a broad condition that could be satisfied by multiple scenarios, including those where Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 3 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that 4 or more statements must be true, which aligns with the possibility of Statement 4 being true but contradicts the scenario where Statement 3 is the only true statement about the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 6: Consider Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible numbers of true statements that are prime from 1 to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Consider Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are those that have more than two divisors. For 7 statements, if 2, 3, 4, or 5 statements are true, then the number of false statements would be 5, 4, 3, or 2, respectively. Among these, 4 is the only composite number, suggesting a specific scenario where Statement 4 could potentially be true.\n\n## Step 8: Synthesize Information\nGiven the constraints, especially from Statements 5, 6, and 7, and considering the prime and composite conditions, we can start to narrow down the possibilities. Statement 3 cannot be true because it would make all statements true, which contradicts the conditions set by other statements. Statement 4, suggesting exactly 2 false statements (and thus 5 true statements), aligns with Statement 7 (since 2 false statements is a prime number of false statements, not composite, this creates a conflict) and potentially with Statement 6 if the number of true statements is prime.\n\n## Step 9: Identify Potential Solutions\n- If Statement 3 is true, all statements must be true, which is not possible given the conditions.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true. This could potentially satisfy Statement 6 (since 5 is a prime number) but does not directly satisfy Statement 7 as intended because 2 (the number of false statements) is prime, not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Reconcile Conflicts and Determine Validity\nUpon closer inspection, the initial interpretation of Statement 7 in Step 7 overlooked the direct implication of composite numbers. A composite number of false statements would indeed support scenarios where the number of false statements is not prime (i.e., 4 false statements). However, the conditions provided, especially with the requirement for the number of true statements to be prime and the constraints around true and false statements, limit the possible scenarios significantly.\n\n## Step 11: Final Analysis\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation:\n- Statement 3 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with other statements.\n- Statement 4, suggesting 5 true statements, aligns with the prime condition (Statement 6) but seems to misalign with the composite condition upon a direct reading (Statement 7).\n- The critical insight lies in recognizing which statements can coexist truthfully. Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 can potentially coexist if exactly 5 statements are true, satisfying the prime condition (Statement 6) and the \"at least 3 true\" condition (Statement 1). Statement 2 (\"at most 3 false\") is also satisfied in this scenario.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Thus, if Statement 3 is true, it leads to a contradiction.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false. This means 5 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 cannot be true because it claims all statements are true. This scenario does not immediately create a contradiction with the other statements.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate Statement 5\nStatement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the analysis of Statement 3, if it's true, it leads to a contradiction. Thus, Statement 4 being true is the viable option under Statement 5, allowing for the possibility that exactly 2 statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Consider Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 says at least 3 of these statements are true, and Statement 2 says at most 3 of these statements are false. If exactly 2 statements are false (as per Statement 4), then 5 statements are true.

However, given the strict definitions and conditions, especially with Statement 7 requiring a composite number of false statements (and 2 not being composite), and the contradiction arising from the interpretation of Statement 5 with Statements 3 and 4, we find that satisfying all conditions simultaneously is not feasible without violating at least one statement's truthfulness.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This satisfies Statement 6 (3 is prime) and Statement 7 (4 is composite). However, this step requires identifying which statements can be true to satisfy all given conditions without direct contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Reconcile with Statement 5\nGiven Statement 5, where either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and knowing both essentially convey the same outcome (5 true statements), we must find a configuration that respects the conditions without directly violating Statement 5's intent.\n\n## Step 12: Conclusion\nConsidering the constraints and the need for consistency across all statements, the challenge lies in satisfying the prime and composite conditions while respecting the \"at least,\" \"at most,\" \"exactly,\" and \"either/or\" conditions. The direct analysis shows that having exactly 3 true statements (and thus 4 false statements) could potentially satisfy several conditions ( Statements 6 and 7 directly), but this does not align with the initial analysis of Statements 1 through 5 without considering the logical inconsistencies and paradoxes that arise from attempting to satisfy all statements simultaneously.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means the minimum number of true statements is 3.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 1 of these statements is false. This implies that the maximum number of false statements is 1, meaning at least 6 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 6 of these statements are true. If this is true, then Statement 2 must also be true because having 6 true statements means only 1 is false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 2 of these statements are false. This would mean 5 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This creates an interesting dynamic because if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. The relevant prime numbers here could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since we're dealing with 7 statements.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. For 7 statements, the possible number of false statements could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, but only 4 and 6 are composite.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's evaluate the possibilities:\n\n- **From Statement 2**, we know that at most 1 statement can be false, which means at least 6 statements must be true. This aligns with **Statement 3**.\n\n- **Statement 3** being true (6 true statements) contradicts **Statement 4** (5 true statements), which is allowed by **Statement 5**.\n\n- **Statement 6** suggests the number of true statements must be a prime number. Given the constraints, the only prime number that fits the criteria of having at least 6 true statements (from Statement 2) is 7, but this contradicts Statement 3 which says exactly 6 are true.\n\n- **Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be composite. If exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3), then only 1 statement is false, which does not satisfy the composite requirement since 1 is neither composite nor prime in this context.\n\nConsidering all statements, the critical path seems to be the conflict between the requirement for at least 6 true statements (Statements 2 and 3) and the prime number of true statements (Statement 6). Statement 6 suggests that for the number of true statements to be prime, it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but only 7 fits the \"at least 6 true\" criteria from Statement 2, which then conflicts with Statement 3's exactness.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection:\n\n- If **Statement 3** is true (exactly 6 true), then **Statement 7** is false because 1 false statement is not composite. This makes **Statement 5**'s condition satisfied if **Statement 4** is also false.\n- **Statement 6** cannot be satisfied under the condition of exactly 6 true statements because 6 is not a prime number.\n\nGiven these complexities, let's consider the possible scenarios that satisfy all given conditions:\n\n1. **All statements except one are true**: This would mean Statement 3 is true, which aligns with Statement 2. However, this scenario makes Statement 7 false (since 1 is not considered composite in this logical framework), and it contradicts Statement 6 because 6 is not a prime number.\n\n2. **Considering Statement 6**, for the number of true statements to be prime, the only feasible prime number of true statements under these constraints is indeed 7 (since 2, 3, and 5 do not meet the \"at least 6 true\" requirement from Statement 2). However, this would mean all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 7 (since 0 false statements do not fit the composite requirement) and Statement 4 (which requires exactly 2 false statements).\n\nGiven the above analysis, it seems there's a misunderstanding in directly applying the conditions without considering the logical implications fully. Let's correct the approach:\n\n- **Statement 2** and **Statement 3** can both be true if exactly 6 statements are true.\n- **Statement 5** allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, not both. If Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false.\n- **Statement 6** requires the number of true statements to be prime. The only way to satisfy the conditions with a prime number of true statements is to have all statements true (7 true), which would make Statement 6 true but contradicts other statements.\n\nUpon reevaluation, the conditions provided create a paradoxical scenario where satisfying one statement often leads to the contradiction of another. The key lies in Statement 5, which allows for the exclusion of Statement 4 when Statement 3 is true, and the requirement for a prime number of true statements (Statement 6), which suggests a specific, limited set of outcomes.\n\nHowever, the conditions given, especially with the requirement for the number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), along with the constraints of at least 3 true (Statement 1), at most 1 false (Statement 2), and the mutual exclusivity of Statements 3 and 4 (Statement 5), create a complex logical puzzle.\n\nThe critical insight is recognizing that these statements are self-referential and involve logical conditions that must be satisfied simultaneously. Given the constraints and the nature of self-referential paradoxes, the solution space is limited and must satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.\n\nGiven the complexity and the self-referential nature of these statements, let's consider the feasibility of solutions:\n\n- For all statements to be logically consistent, we must find a scenario where no statement contradicts another.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the need for logical consistency across all statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Statement 5 would be true because it states either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 (the number of true statements is a prime number) would be false because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 (the number of false statements is a composite number) would be true because 1 is not considered a composite number in this context, but since we are evaluating the scenario where Statement 3 is true, we focus on the truthfulness of statements given this condition.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluating Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false, and 5 are true.

If Statement 4 is true, we have 5 true statements and 2 false, satisfying Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) but not Statement 7 (since 2 is prime, not composite).\n\n## Step 6: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the analysis, the only scenario that fits all possible conditions without contradiction, considering the prime and composite requirements, is when Statement 4 is true. This is because it allows for 5 true statements (a prime number), which directly satisfies Statement 6, and the conditions around Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5 can be resolved with Statement 4 being true. However, the evaluation of Statement 7's truthfulness in the context of composite numbers being strictly greater than 1 and not prime indicates a need to focus on the direct implications of Statements 3, 4, and 5. Thus, considering all constraints, especially the requirement for the number of true statements to be prime and the interplay between Statements 3, 4, and 5, we find that there's a specific set of conditions that must be met for the statements to hold true without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 3 of these statements are true. This means the minimum number of true statements is 3.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 1 of these statements is false. This implies that the maximum number of false statements is 1, meaning at least 6 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 6 of these statements are true. If this is true, then Statement 2 must also be true because having 6 true statements means only 1 is false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 2 of these statements are false. This would mean 5 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This creates an interesting dynamic because if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. The relevant prime numbers here could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since we're dealing with 7 statements.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. For 7 statements, the possible number of false statements could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, but only 4 and 6 are composite.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's evaluate the possibilities:\n\n- **From Statement 2**, we know that at most 1 statement can be false, which means at least 6 statements must be true. This aligns with **Statement 3**.\n\n- **Statement 3** being true (6 true statements) contradicts **Statement 4** (5 true statements), which is allowed by **Statement 5**.\n\n- **Statement 6** suggests the number of true statements must be a prime number. Given the constraints, the only prime number that fits the criteria of having at least 6 true statements (from Statement 2) is 7, but this contradicts Statement 3 which says exactly 6 are true.\n\n- **Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be composite. If exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3), then only 1 statement is false, which does not satisfy the composite requirement since 1 is neither composite nor prime in this context.\n\nConsidering all statements, the critical path seems to be the conflict between the requirement for at least 6 true statements (Statements 2 and 3) and the prime number of true statements (Statement 6). Statement 6 suggests that for the number of true statements to be prime, it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but only 7 fits the \"at least 6 true\" criteria from Statement 2, which then conflicts with Statement 3's exactness.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection:\n\n- If **Statement 3** is true (exactly 6 true), then **Statement 7** is false because 1 false statement is not composite. This makes **Statement 5**'s condition satisfied if **Statement 4** is also false.\n- **Statement 6** cannot be satisfied under the condition of exactly 6 true statements because 6 is not a prime number.\n\nGiven these complexities, let's consider the possible scenarios that satisfy all given conditions:\n\n1. **All statements except one are true**: This would mean Statement 3 is true, which aligns with Statement 2. However, this scenario makes Statement 7 false (since 1 is not considered composite in this logical framework), and it contradicts Statement 6 because 6 is not a prime number.\n\n2. **Considering Statement 6**, for the number of true statements to be prime, the only feasible prime number of true statements under these constraints is indeed 7 (since 2, 3, and 5 do not meet the \"at least 6 true\" requirement from Statement 2). However, this would mean all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 7 (since 0 false statements do not fit the composite requirement) and Statement 4 (which requires exactly 2 false statements).\n\nGiven the above analysis, it seems there's a misunderstanding in directly applying the conditions without considering the logical implications fully. Let's correct the approach:\n\n- **Statement 2** and **Statement 3** can both be true if exactly 6 statements are true.\n- **Statement 5** allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, not both. If Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false.\n- **Statement 6** requires the number of true statements to be prime. The only way to satisfy the conditions with a prime number of true statements is to have all statements true (7 true), which would make Statement 6 true but contradicts other statements.\n\nUpon reevaluation, the conditions provided create a paradoxical scenario where satisfying one statement often leads to the contradiction of another. The key lies in Statement 5, which allows for the exclusion of Statement 4 when Statement 3 is true, and the requirement for a prime number of true statements (Statement 6), which suggests a specific, limited set of outcomes.\n\nHowever, the conditions given, especially with the requirement for the number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), along with the constraints of at least 3 true (Statement 1), at most 1 false (Statement 2), and the mutual exclusivity of Statements 3 and 4 (Statement 5), create a complex logical puzzle.\n\nThe critical insight is recognizing that these statements are self-referential and involve logical conditions that must be satisfied simultaneously. Given the constraints and the nature of self-referential paradoxes, the solution space is limited and must satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.\n\nGiven the complexity and the self-referential nature of these statements, let's consider the feasibility of solutions:\n\n- For all statements to be logically consistent, we must find a scenario where no statement contradicts another.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the need for logical consistency across all statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, which means the number of true statements can be 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 5 of the 7 statements are true. This directly specifies the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 says that exactly 2 of the 7 statements are false. This means that 5 statements are true, as there are 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that exactly 5 statements are true, Statement 5 essentially says that exactly 5 statements are true, but it does not add new information about the number of true statements beyond what Statements 3 and 4 provide.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible number of true statements according to this statement can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 says that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This means the number of false statements can be 4 or 6, implying the number of true statements can be 3 or 1, respectively.\n\n## Step 8: Combining Information\nFrom Statements 3 and 4, we see that exactly 5 statements being true satisfies both, but Statement 5 says only one can be true. Statement 6 allows for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements. Statement 7 implies 3 or 1 true statements. However, considering all statements together, the only scenario that fits all conditions without contradiction is having exactly 5 true statements, as it satisfies Statements 1, 3, 4, and 6. Statement 5 is satisfied by choosing either Statement 3 or Statement 4 as true. Statement 7 is satisfied because 2 false statements (and thus 5 true statements) make the number of false statements (2) not composite, but this is a point of contention since 2 is indeed the only even prime number and not composite by the definition used here, indicating a misunderstanding in the analysis regarding composite numbers. Given the correct understanding that 2 is not composite but prime, and re-evaluating Statement 7's impact, we should focus on the statements that directly influence the number of true statements without misinterpreting the definitions.\n\n## Step 9: Correcting the Approach\nGiven the complexity and the error in interpreting Statement 7 regarding composite numbers, let's correct the approach. Statements 3 and 4 both suggest 5 true statements, which aligns with Statement 1 and partially with Statement 2. Statement 5 indicates that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. Statement 6 allows for 5 true statements as a prime number of truths. The misunderstanding of composite numbers in Statement 7 led to confusion. Since 2 is not composite but prime, and we have 7 statements, having exactly 5 true statements (as suggested by Statements 3 and 4) would indeed make 2 false statements, which does not directly conflict with any statement when correctly understood. Thus, the focus should be on the consistency of having exactly 5 true statements as the most straightforward solution that satisfies the majority of the statements without direct contradiction when properly interpreted.\n\n## Step 10: Finalizing the Solution\nGiven the analysis and correcting the misunderstanding about composite numbers, the scenario that fits best without contradiction is having exactly 5 true statements. This satisfies Statements 1, 3 (or 4, given Statement 5's condition), and 6 directly. Statement 2 is also satisfied as 2 false statements are within its \"at most 5 false\" condition. Statement 7, upon reevaluation, does not directly apply as initially misinterpreted due to the definition of composite numbers. Thus, the solution hinges on the number of true statements being exactly 5, which is directly supported by several statements and does not contradict the others when properly understood.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the number of true statements could be any of these, but given the constraints from other statements, we have to consider which of these possibilities are viable.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that the number of true statements could be 3 (if 4 statements are false) or 1 (if 6 statements are false), as 7 - 4 = 3 and 7 - 6 = 1.\n\n## Step 8: Combine Information\nFrom Statements 3 and 4, we know that exactly 5 statements being true is a strong candidate, as it satisfies both and aligns with Statement 1's requirement. Statement 5 supports this indirectly by stating that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 allows for the possibility of 5 true statements since 5 is a prime number. However, we must consider the implications of all statements together for consistency.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Consistency\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), then Statement 1 is satisfied.\n- Statement 2 is also satisfied because 2 statements being false means 5 are true.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, which aligns with our current analysis.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is indeed a prime number.\n- For Statement 7, if 5 statements are true, then 2 are false, which does not directly align with the statement that the number of false statements is composite, since 2 is a prime number, not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the analysis, the statements that can be true and satisfy most conditions are those stating exactly 5 statements are true. However, Statement 7 poses a problem because 2 false statements (implied by 5 true statements) do not fit its condition of being composite. Thus, we have a contradiction when trying to satisfy all statements simultaneously, particularly with Statement 7. This indicates a mistake in assuming all statements can be satisfied under the initial conditions provided without directly assessing their truthfulness in a unified manner.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluation\nUpon closer inspection, the critical insight comes from recognizing the limitations and potential contradictions among the statements, particularly how they define the number of true and false statements and the nature of those numbers (prime, composite).

Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but given the conditions, if Statement 4 is true (all statements are true), it contradicts the premise of evaluating truthfulness among statements. Thus, we focus on scenarios where Statement 3 could be true, allowing for exactly 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Determine Possible Solutions Based on Prime and Composite Conditions\nConsidering Statement 6, which requires the number of true statements to be prime, and given that exactly 5 statements being true (as per Statement 3) satisfies this condition (since 5 is a prime number), we can start building a consistent scenario. Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. With exactly 5 true statements, there would be 2 false statements, which does not satisfy the composite requirement directly since 2 is a prime number. However, this step helps to narrow down the feasibility of each statement being true or false based on the given conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Assess the Feasibility of Each Statement\nGiven the conditions and the necessity for consistency, we must assess which statements can be true together without causing a paradox. Statements 1 and 2 provide broad conditions that can encompass the truthfulness of other statements. Statement 3 provides a specific condition that, if true, helps to satisfy Statement 6 (prime number of true statements). Statement 5 ensures that we choose between Statements 3 and 4, leaning towards Statement 3 for a feasible solution. However, upon closer inspection, the conditions provided by Statements 6 and 7, along with the implications of Statements 3 and 4, reveal a complex interplay that requires careful consideration of logical consistency.\n\n## Step 11: Reconcile Statements for Logical Consistency\nUpon reconciliation, we notice that having exactly 5 true statements satisfies several conditions: it fits Statement 3, aligns with the prime requirement of Statement 6, and allows for the evaluation of other statements' truthfulness. However, the direct assignment of truth values to all statements while maintaining logical consistency across all given conditions is necessary for determining the exact number of possible solutions.\n\n## Step 12: Final Evaluation of Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the need for logical consistency, the evaluation of possible solutions hinges on identifying a set of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction. This involves considering the implications of each statement on the others and determining the combinations that can coexist truthfully.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but given the conditions, if Statement 4 is true (all statements are true), it contradicts the premise of evaluating truthfulness among statements. Thus, we focus on scenarios where Statement 3 could be true, allowing for exactly 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Determine Possible Solutions Based on Prime and Composite Conditions\nConsidering Statement 6, which requires the number of true statements to be prime, and given that exactly 5 statements being true (as per Statement 3) satisfies this condition (since 5 is a prime number), we can start building a consistent scenario. Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. With exactly 5 true statements, there would be 2 false statements, which does not satisfy the composite requirement directly since 2 is a prime number. However, this step helps to narrow down the feasibility of each statement being true or false based on the given conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Assess the Feasibility of Each Statement\nGiven the conditions and the necessity for consistency, we must assess which statements can be true together without causing a paradox. Statements 1 and 2 provide broad conditions that can encompass the truthfulness of other statements. Statement 3 provides a specific condition that, if true, helps to satisfy Statement 6 (prime number of true statements). Statement 5 ensures that we choose between Statements 3 and 4, leaning towards Statement 3 for a feasible solution. However, upon closer inspection, the conditions provided by Statements 6 and 7, along with the implications of Statements 3 and 4, reveal a complex interplay that requires careful consideration of logical consistency.\n\n## Step 11: Reconcile Statements for Logical Consistency\nUpon reconciliation, we notice that having exactly 5 true statements satisfies several conditions: it fits Statement 3, aligns with the prime requirement of Statement 6, and allows for the evaluation of other statements' truthfulness. However, the direct assignment of truth values to all statements while maintaining logical consistency across all given conditions is necessary for determining the exact number of possible solutions.\n\n## Step 12: Final Evaluation of Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the need for logical consistency, the evaluation of possible solutions hinges on identifying a set of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction. This involves considering the implications of each statement on the others and determining the combinations that can coexist truthfully.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, which translates to the number of true statements being 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true. If this is true, then 2 statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false, meaning all statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.

Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 8: Combine Information from All Statements\nFrom Statement 3 and Statement 4, with Statement 5, we have two exclusive scenarios: one where exactly 5 statements are true (and thus 2 are false), and one where all 7 statements are true (and thus 0 are false).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true, and 2 are false. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true) and Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both). It also satisfies Statement 6 because 5 is a prime number.

The correct approach is to identify that the conditions given by the statements, especially with the constraints of Statement 5 and the prime/composite requirements, limit the possible outcomes significantly.

This directly contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the nature of Statement 3 and Statement 4, if either were true, it would create a paradox because Statement 3 cannot coexist with Statement 1's condition, and Statement 4 cannot be true if any statement is true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 suggests the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible numbers of true statements, given 7 statements, that are prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 states the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. Given 7 statements, the possible numbers of false statements that are composite are 4 and 6, since 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite or are prime.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate Compatibility of Statements\n- If all statements were true (to satisfy Statement 2), it would contradict Statement 3 and Statement 4 directly. Also, Statement 5 cannot be true because it suggests only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n- Statement 1 requires at least 2 true statements, which is compatible with Statement 6 if we consider 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite, which means 4 or 6 false statements. This aligns with having 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the Paradoxical Nature of Some Statements\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, and if either is true, it creates a paradox with other statements. Statement 5's truth hinges on the exclusivity of Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true, which is problematic given their nature.\n\n## Step 10: Determine Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the analysis, we need to find a combination where the statements do not contradict each other. Statement 6 and Statement 7 provide clues on the possible distribution of true and false statements but considering the prime and composite requirements.\n\n## Step 11: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nThe statements create a complex web of possibilities and contradictions. However, given the conditions, especially from Statement 6 and Statement 7, and considering the requirement for at least 2 true statements from Statement 1, we must find a scenario that satisfies these conditions without contradicting the others.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

However, if only 1 statement is true, it must be Statement 1 itself to satisfy the condition of at least one statement being true, which leads to a contradiction since Statement 1 would then be false. Thus, if Statement 1 is false, all statements must be false, which directly contradicts the premise that Statement 1 is the only true statement in this scenario. Therefore, Statement 1 must be true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says at most 0 of the statements are false, meaning all statements must be true. However, given the nature of some statements, this cannot be possible since some statements directly contradict each other (e.g., Statement 3 and Statement 4). Thus, Statement 2 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims exactly 1 of the statements is true. Given that Statement 1 must be true (from Step 1), if Statement 3 were also true, it would contradict its own claim since there would be at least two true statements (Statement 1 and Statement 3). Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 7 of the statements are false, meaning all statements are false. However, since Statement 1 is true (from Step 1), Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false (from Steps 3 and 4), Statement 5 is also false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. Given that Statement 1 is true and at least one more statement needs to be true to satisfy Statement 1, the possible numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7 (prime numbers less than 7). We already know Statement 2, 3, 4, and 5 are false. Thus, for Statement 6 to be true, either 2 or 3 statements must be true since 5 and 7 are not possible given the falsehood of Statements 2 through 5.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. Since there are 7 statements in total, if 2 statements are true (satisfying Statement 1 and potentially Statement 6), then 5 statements are false. 5 is a prime number, not a composite number, so Statement 7 would be false in this scenario. If 3 statements are true, then 4 statements are false. 4 is a composite number, which would make Statement 7 true.\n\n## Step 8: Determine Possible Solutions\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2, 3, 4, and 5 are false.\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. Given Statement 1 is true, and Statement 6 could be true, and potentially one more, this suggests 2 or 3 true statements.\n- Statement 7 can only be true if 4 statements are false (since 4 is composite), which aligns with 3 statements being true.\n\nThe only scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction is having exactly 3 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7) and 4 false statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5), which makes the number of false statements composite (4) and the number of true statements prime (3).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This contradicts Statement 7 (which requires a composite number of false statements, and 4 is indeed composite, so this part aligns). However, Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) is satisfied because 3 is prime. But Statements 1 and 2 cannot be true because they require at least 5 true statements, which contradicts our premise. Thus, this scenario does not lead to a consistent solution.\n\n- **If Statement 4 is true (Exactly 1 false),** then Statement 3 must be false (because of Statement 5), and we have 6 true statements. This aligns with Statement 6 (6 is not a prime, so this actually contradicts the statement). However, having 1 false statement contradicts Statement 7 (which requires a composite number of false statements, and 1 is not composite). Statements 1 and 2 are satisfied because we have more than 5 true statements. This scenario also does not lead to a consistent solution because it contradicts both Statements 6 and 7.\n\nConsidering the constraints and looking for consistency across all statements:\n\n- For **Statement 6 to be true**, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- For **Statement 7 to be true**, the number of false statements must be a composite number (4 or 6), meaning the number of true statements must be 3 or 1, respectively, to satisfy the total of 7 statements.

This means the number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 2 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7, which aligns with Statement 1.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 3 of the 7 statements are true. This contradicts both Statement 1 and Statement 2, which require at least 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 1 of the 7 statements is false. This means that 6 statements are true, which is consistent with Statements 1 and 2.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given that Statement 3 cannot be true based on the analysis of Statements 1 and 2, Statement 4 could potentially be true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since we've established that there must be at least 5 true statements, the possible numbers of true statements that are prime are 5 and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. If there are 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements (which is prime, not composite), and if there are 6 true statements, there is 1 false statement (which is not composite), and if there are 7 true statements, there are 0 false statements (which is not composite). However, if we consider the possibility of 5 true statements, it does not fit Statement 7 directly because 2 (the number of false statements) is prime, not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Combine the Analyses\nFrom the analyses, we see that Statement 3 cannot be true, which means Statement 4 could be true based on Statement 5. Statement 4 being true means 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. This scenario aligns with Statements 1, 2, and 4. However, Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime, and 6 is not prime. Thus, we have a conflict. The only prime number of true statements that satisfies all conditions including Statement 6 is 5, but this does not align with Statement 4 or the composite requirement of false statements directly.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate for Consistency\nGiven the constraints and upon re-evaluation, if exactly 5 statements are true, this satisfies Statements 1, 2, and 6 (since 5 is prime). Statement 3 is false, which could make Statement 5 true if Statement 4 is false. Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite; with 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements, which is prime, not composite. Thus, we have a misunderstanding in Step 7 regarding the application of Statement 7. The correct approach should focus on the feasibility of each statement given the others.\n\n## Step 10: Final Evaluation\nGiven the complexities and the need for consistency across all statements, let's focus on the critical ones: Statements 1, 2, and 6. Statement 6 limits the true statements to prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7), but Statements 1 and 2 require at least 5 true statements, narrowing it down to 5 or 7 true statements for primality. Since Statement 3 cannot be true (as it contradicts Statements 1 and 2), and if we consider Statement 4 (exactly 1 false statement), it aligns with having 6 true statements, which is not prime and thus contradicts Statement 6. The mistake here is trying to fit all statements into a coherent truth table without systematically checking each possible combination of true and false statements against all given statements.\n\n## Step 11: Systematic Approach\nA systematic approach requires checking each possible scenario against all statements. However, given the constraints and the format required for the answer, the focus should be on determining the feasibility of solutions based on the given statements' constraints without manually checking each combination.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. For 7 statements, if 5 or 6 statements are true, the number of false statements would be 2 or 1, respectively. 2 is a composite number (divisible by 2), but 1 is not considered composite. If 7 statements are true, there are 0 false statements, and 0 is not considered composite or prime in this context.\n\n## Step 8: Combining the Information\nFrom the analysis, Statement 3 cannot be true, which means Statement 4 could potentially be true (as per Statement 5). Statement 4 being true means 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. However, this scenario does not directly satisfy Statement 7 since 1 false statement is not composite.

Statement 1 and Statement 2 allow for this possibility.\n- Given Statement 5, and knowing Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 being true would mean 6 true statements, which does not fit the prime requirement of Statement 6.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nConsidering all statements, the only way for most statements to be true and satisfy the conditions is to have either 5 or 7 true statements, as these are the prime numbers within the possible range. However, Statement 4 suggests 6 true statements, which does not fit the prime requirement. Statement 3 is false, which means Statement 4 could be true according to Statement 5, but this leads to a contradiction with Statement 6.

Composite numbers among these are 4, 6.\n\nGiven these statements, let's find a consistent solution:\n\n- **Statement 1** requires at least 6 true statements.\n- **Statement 2** allows for up to 3 false statements, which means at least 4 true statements.\n- **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** both suggest exactly 4 true statements, which contradicts **Statement 1** if it's interpreted to require exactly 6 or 7 true statements.\n- **Statement 5** suggests a contradiction between **Statement 3** and **Statement 4**, but they essentially convey the same information.\n- **Statement 6** suggests the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- **Statement 7** suggests the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6, given the context).\n\nThe only scenario that fits all these conditions without contradiction is having **exactly 4 true statements and 3 false statements**. This satisfies:\n- **Statement 3** (Exactly 4 true).\n- **Statement 4** (Exactly 3 false, which means 4 true).\n- **Statement 6** (4 is not prime, so this statement must be one of the false ones to satisfy the prime condition for true statements, which doesn't directly fit but let's continue evaluating).\n- **Statement 7** (3 false statements, and 3 is not composite, it's prime, so this condition isn't met as written, indicating a mistake in the initial interpretation).\n\nUpon closer inspection, the conditions create a paradox, especially with **Statement 5** and the interpretation of prime and composite numbers in the context of true and false statements. \n\nHowever, if we strictly follow the logic without the error:\n- For **Statement 6** to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. Given the constraints, the only prime number of true statements that could work is 5 (since 2 and 3 are too low given the \"at least\" and \"at most\" conditions from Statements 1 and 2, and 7 is too high because it contradicts the possibility of any statement being false).\n- **Statement 7** suggests the number of false statements should be composite. With 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements, which doesn't fit because 2 is prime, not composite.\n\nGiven this analysis, the initial interpretation aimed to reconcile the statements under a consistent logic framework but encountered a paradox due to the constraints provided. The correct approach should reconsider the implications of each statement more accurately:\n\n1. If **Statement 3** is true (exactly 4 true statements), then **Statement 4** must also be true (since it says the same thing in essence), which contradicts **Statement 5**.\n2. **Statement 6** requires a prime number of true statements. This could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n3. **Statement 7** requires a composite number of false statements, which could be 4 or 6 false statements, given the total of 7 statements.\n\nThe only way for **Statement 6** and **Statement 7** to both be true (considering the prime and composite requirements) is to have **5 true statements and 2 false statements**. This scenario:\n- Makes **Statement 6** true because 5 is a prime number.\n- But it fails to make **Statement 7** true because 2 is a prime number, not a composite number.\n\nUpon reevaluation, the error in initial reasoning becomes apparent: the conditions provided by the statements are too restrictive and lead to a logical contradiction when attempting to satisfy all of them simultaneously. The conditions around prime and composite numbers, combined with the specific counts of true and false statements, create a scenario where no single set of true and false assignments can satisfy all given statements without violating at least one condition.\n\nThus, given the strict interpretations and the aim to find a scenario that fits all conditions without contradiction, we find that the setup provided leads to a logical impasse. The conditions as stated cannot all be true simultaneously due to the inherent contradictions and the specific nature of prime and composite numbers in relation to the possible counts of true and false statements.\n\n<answer>0</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that at least 6 of these 7 statements are true. This means that the minimum number of true statements is 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 3 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that the maximum number of false statements is 3, which in turn means the minimum number of true statements is 4 (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true. This directly states the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false. This means that exactly 4 statements are true (since 7 - 3 = 4), which is the same as Statement 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, Statements 3 and 4 essentially say the same thing (4 true statements), so they cannot be true at the same time without violating the conditions of Statement 5.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible numbers of true statements that are prime from the given statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are numbers with more than two divisors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6 (since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite).\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the Possibility of Each Statement Being True\n- If Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements must be true, which contradicts Statements 3 and 4.\n- Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true according to Statement 5, but they essentially state the same condition.\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. Given the constraints, only 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements would satisfy this, but Statement 1 requires at least 6 true statements, limiting the possibility to 7 true statements if we consider only Statement 6.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. With 7 statements, this means 4 or 6 false statements, which translates to 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Combine the Conditions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 requires at least 6 true statements.\n- Statement 2 requires at most 3 false statements, implying at least 4 true statements.\n- Statements 3 and 4 both imply exactly 4 true statements, but Statement 5 says only one can be true.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite.\n\nThe only scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction is when exactly 6 statements are true (which would make Statement 1 true and also satisfy the prime condition of Statement 6 if we consider 6 is not prime but it's the only way to satisfy Statement 1 without contradicting other statements directly). However, this creates a problem since Statement 6 specifically requires a prime number of true statements, and 6 is not prime.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate for Consistency\nUpon closer inspection, the conditions create a paradox unless we find a scenario that satisfies all without contradiction. The critical insight is recognizing that Statement 6 (the number of true statements is a prime number) and the implications of the other statements must align. Given that exactly 4 true statements (as per Statements 3 and 4) would satisfy the condition of being a prime number of true statements (since 4 is not prime but it's a direct statement), we must consider the implications of Statement 5 and the truthfulness of Statements 3 and 4 in a way that aligns with all other statements.\n\nHowever, the analysis shows a misunderstanding in Step 9 regarding the satisfaction of conditions. Let's correct the approach by directly evaluating the consistency of the statements:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true (exactly 4 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false (since they cannot both be true according to Statement 5), which means exactly 4 statements are true, satisfying the condition of Statement 3 but not directly aligning with the prime requirement of Statement 6.\n\n## Step 11: Final Evaluation\nConsidering the constraints and the need for consistency:\n- Statement 1 cannot be true because it requires at least 6 true statements, which would make Statements 3 and 4 false.\n- Statement 6 requires a prime number of true statements, which could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Given the constraints, the only prime number of true statements that could potentially satisfy all conditions without direct contradiction is not achievable because Statement 1 demands at least 6 true statements, which is not prime.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 8: Consider Possible Scenarios Based on Prime and Composite Conditions\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements must be 3 or 1, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Other Conditions\n- If Statement 3 is true (exactly 2 statements are true), it contradicts Statement 1 and does not satisfy the prime condition for true statements as per Statement 6.\n- If Statement 4 is true (exactly 2 statements are false, meaning 5 are true), it satisfies Statement 1 and the prime condition for true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the Implications of Statement 5\nGiven Statement 5, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. However, Statement 3 cannot be true because it contradicts other necessary conditions like Statement 1.\n\n## Step 11: Synthesize Information\nConsidering all statements, the only feasible scenario that satisfies most conditions without contradiction is having 5 true statements (satisfying Statement 4, Statement 1, and the prime condition of Statement 6). Statement 2 is always true by default. Statement 7 is satisfied if we have 2 false statements (5 true statements), which does not directly align with its condition but is a consequence of satisfying other statements.\n\n## Step 12: Determine Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the process of elimination, we need to find a combination that satisfies all conditions without contradiction. The critical statements to satisfy are Statement 1, Statement 4, Statement 6, and by default, Statement 2. Statement 5 dictates that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, and given the analysis, Statement 4 is the viable option.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This implies that at least 4 statements must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 asserts that exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true. This means 3 statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true at the same time (as they imply different numbers of true and false statements), this statement seems plausible but depends on the truth of Statement 3 or Statement 4.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible prime numbers of true statements out of 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6, since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the Possibility of Each Statement Being True\n- If Statement 1 is true, all statements must be true, which contradicts the conditions of Statements 3 and 4, and also Statement 5 since both 3 and 4 cannot be true.\n- Statement 2 allows for 4 or more statements to be true, which aligns with the possibility of Statements 3 and 4 being true but not at the same time due to Statement 5.\n- Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true, as they state different conditions that cannot coexist.\n- Statement 5 allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both, creating a condition where one of these statements must be false.\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers, which could align with Statement 3 (4 true statements) if we consider the total number of statements and the conditions given.\n- Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite, which could align with having 4 false statements (if Statement 3 is true) or 3 false statements (if Statement 4 is true), but given the conditions, only one scenario can actually occur.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 cannot be true because it requires all statements to be true, which contradicts other statements.\n- Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true.\n- Statement 5 ensures that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite.\n\nConsidering these, if Statement 3 is true (4 true statements), then 3 statements are false, which is not composite, contradicting Statement 7. If Statement 4 is true (4 true statements, 3 false), this aligns with Statement 7 (3 is not composite, but this could be a misunderstanding since 3 false statements do not satisfy the composite requirement directly), but it does satisfy the condition of Statement 5 and potentially aligns with Statement 6 if we consider the prime number of true statements.\n\nHowever, a closer examination reveals that if Statement 4 is true (exactly 3 statements are false), and considering Statement 6 (the number of true statements is a prime number), having exactly 4 true statements (which includes Statement 4 itself) does not directly conflict with the prime requirement since 4 is not prime, indicating a mistake in the initial alignment consideration with Statement 6.\n\nThe correct alignment should consider that if Statement 3 is true, it directly states 4 statements are true, which is not a prime number, thus contradicting Statement 6. If Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are true, which also is not a prime number, again contradicting Statement 6.\n\nGiven the conditions and upon reevaluation:\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite (4 or 6 in this context).\n\nThe only prime number of true statements that could potentially satisfy all conditions without direct contradiction is having 3 true statements (since 2, 5, and 7 true statements would either contradict Statement 7 or the conditions set by Statements 3 and 4). However, this creates a paradox because if 3 statements are true, Statement 3 cannot be one of them (since it claims 4 true statements), and Statement 4 also cannot be true (since it claims 3 false statements, implying 4 true statements).\n\nThus, the evaluation process reveals a complex interplay where satisfying one statement often leads to a contradiction with another, especially considering the prime and composite requirements.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and the analysis, the solution must satisfy all statements without contradiction. The initial analysis overlooked the critical aspect of prime and composite numbers in relation to the total number of statements and the specific claims of each statement. The correct approach is to identify which statements can coexist without contradiction, considering the prime number of true statements and the composite number of false statements.\n\nUpon careful consideration, the conditions provided by the statements, especially the requirement for a prime number of true statements and a composite number of false statements, along with the constraints of Statements 3, 4, and 5, lead to a situation where finding a set of true statements that satisfies all conditions without contradiction is challenging.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Statement 5 cannot be true because it suggests an exclusivity between Statements 3 and 4 that doesn't apply in terms of outcome.

However, upon closer inspection, the actual alignment is:\n- Having 4 true statements satisfies Statements 3 and 4 directly.\n- It does not directly satisfy Statement 6 since 4 is not a prime number.\n- Having 3 false statements does not satisfy Statement 7 since 3 is not a composite number.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation:\n- The condition that the number of true statements is prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements is composite (Statement 7) limits the possibilities significantly.\n- The only prime number of true statements that could fit with a composite number of false statements (without directly contradicting other statements) would indeed require a careful match. However, given the direct conditions:\n- Statement 6 (prime true statements) and Statement 7 (composite false statements) provide specific numerical constraints.\n- A composite number of false statements could be 4 (implying 3 true statements) or 6 (implying 1 true statement), but only the scenario with 3 true statements (and thus 4 false statements) could potentially align with having a prime number of true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nUpon careful analysis, the constraints provided by the statements, especially regarding prime and composite numbers, and the conditions of at least, at most, and exact numbers of true and false statements, lead to a specific scenario that must satisfy all given conditions without contradiction. However, the detailed step-by-step reveals complexities and potential contradictions based on the strict definitions of prime and composite numbers and the conditions set forth by each statement.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This implies that the maximum number of false statements is 1, which means the minimum number of true statements is 6.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 states that exactly 4 of the 7 statements are true. If this is true, then 3 statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says that exactly 3 of the 7 statements are false. This means that 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (as they imply different numbers of true and false statements), this statement seems to introduce a condition that needs to be considered in conjunction with the others.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible numbers of true statements that are prime from 1 to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are numbers that have at least one divisor other than 1 and themselves. From 1 to 7, the composite numbers are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 8: Combine the Information\n- From Statement 1, we know at least 2 statements are true.\n- From Statement 2, we understand that at most 1 statement is false, implying at least 6 are true, which seems to contradict the minimum requirement of Statement 1 unless exactly 6 or 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (by Statement 5), and they suggest 4 true statements.\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6), which would mean 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Consistency\nGiven the constraints:\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (Statement 3), then 3 are false, which fits Statement 4 but contradicts Statement 7 since 3 is not a composite number.\n- If exactly 3 statements are false (Statement 4), then 4 are true, which fits Statement 3 but again contradicts Statement 7 for the same reason.\n- For Statement 6 to be true (prime number of true statements), and considering Statement 7 (composite number of false statements), the only possible scenario that fits all conditions including Statement 1 and Statement 2's implications is when exactly 6 statements are true (which is not prime, thus contradicting Statement 6) or 7 statements are true (which would make Statement 2 and Statement 7 potentially consistent but contradicts the premise of Statement 5 and the specific claims of Statements 3 and 4).\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nGiven the contradictions and the specific conditions, the only way for most of these statements to hold true without direct contradiction is if exactly 6 statements are true, which would make Statement 6 false (since 6 is not a prime number), and this scenario does not satisfy all given conditions perfectly due to the constraints provided. However, evaluating the possibility of satisfying all given statements under the constraints shows that having exactly 3 true statements (2, 3, and 5 being true, for example) could potentially satisfy the conditions given by the statements about the number of true and false statements being prime or composite, but this does not align with the direct claims of Statements 3 and 4 without contradicting other statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understanding the Statements\nFirst, let's break down what each statement implies about the total number of true or false statements among the 7 given statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 1\nStatement 1 says at least 4 of the statements are true. This means the number of true statements could be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 says at most 1 of the statements is false. This means the number of true statements could be 6 or 7, since having 0 false statements means all 7 are true, and having 1 false statement means 6 are true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims exactly 4 of the statements are true. This directly implies 3 statements are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 3 of the statements are false, which means 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true at the same time (as they imply different numbers of true and false statements), this statement helps to narrow down the possibilities.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible numbers of true statements, according to this rule, are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 states the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies the possible numbers of false statements are 4 or 6, meaning 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Combining the Information\nGiven the constraints:\n- From Statement 1, we have at least 4 true statements.\n- From Statement 2, we have at most 1 false statement, implying 6 or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (Statement 5), and they imply 4 true statements.\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 limits the number of false statements to composite numbers (4, 6), implying 3 or 1 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Finding Consistent Solutions\nConsidering all statements, we look for scenarios where all conditions can be met without contradiction. Given the constraints, the only scenario that fits all possible true statements without contradicting any statement is when exactly 4 statements are true, as this satisfies the \"at least 4 true\" (Statement 1), does not violate \"at most 1 false\" (Statement 2) since it allows for 3 false statements, and aligns with the prime number of true statements (Statement 6) if we consider 4 is not a prime but it's the only feasible scenario given the other constraints. However, this step requires identifying which statements can be true together without violating their claims.\n\n## Step 11: Identifying Possible True Statements\nIf exactly 4 statements are true (satisfying Statement 3), then Statement 4 cannot be true (due to Statement 5). This means we have to find 3 other statements that can be true alongside Statement 3 without causing a contradiction.\n\n## Step 12: Checking for Contradictions\nStatement 3 (exactly 4 true) and Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both) can be true. Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) cannot be satisfied with 4 true statements since 4 is not prime, indicating a potential issue with our initial consideration of 4 true statements as a viable solution under all constraints.\n\n## Step 13: Re-evaluating Based on Prime and Composite Constraints\nGiven the prime constraint (Statement 6) and the need for at least 4 true statements, the only prime number of true statements that satisfies this and other conditions (like at most 1 false) is 5 or 7 true statements. However, 5 true statements would mean 2 false statements, which is a prime number, not composite, contradicting Statement 7.\n\n## Step 14: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nConsidering all constraints, especially the requirement for the number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), and given that at least 4 statements must be true (Statement 1) and at most 1 can be false (Statement 2), the scenario that fits is having 7 true statements (since 7 is prime and 0 false statements satisfy the composite requirement in a vacuous sense, as there are no false statements to be composite).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

However, this seems to contradict the higher number of true statements suggested by other statements.\n\n## Step 10: Identifying Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements, the most consistent scenario that emerges and satisfies multiple conditions, especially considering the prime number of true statements (Statement 6) and the constraints from other statements, is having exactly 5 true statements. This satisfies the \"at least 4\" condition from Statement 1, fits the prime number requirement of Statement 6, and aligns with the idea of having more true statements than false, as hinted by the other statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Statement 5 suggests one of them could be true, but given the constraints from other statements, neither can be true without violating the conditions set by Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements, the feasible scenario that respects most conditions without direct contradiction, especially considering the prime and composite requirements, is having 5 true statements. This would make Statement 6 true. However, we must ensure that no other statement directly contradicts this setup.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

If there are 7 true statements, then 0 statements are false, which does not directly align with Statement 7 since 0 is neither composite nor prime.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Other Statements\nGiven Statement 3 (exactly 2 true statements) and Statement 4 (exactly 7 false statements), both cannot be true at the same time. Statement 5 suggests one of them could be true, but given the constraints from other statements, neither can be true without violating the conditions set by Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements, the feasible scenario that respects most conditions without direct contradiction, especially considering the prime and composite requirements, is having 5 true statements. This would make Statement 6 true. However, we must ensure that no other statement directly contradicts this setup.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means we need a minimum of 2 true statements out of the 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that we can have at most 3 false statements, which means we need at least 4 true statements out of the 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly specifies the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that exactly 4 statements are true, as there are 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply the same condition (4 true statements), they cannot both be true without violating this statement.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

Composite numbers are numbers with more than two factors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6, since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Combining the Information\nFrom Statement 3 and Statement 4, we see that exactly 4 statements must be true for either to be true, which aligns with having 3 false statements (a composite number, satisfying Statement 7) and does not directly conflict with the prime number requirement of true statements (Statement 6), since 4 is not a prime number but the statements do not necessarily require the number of true statements to be prime if other conditions are met.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints, especially from Statements 3, 4, and 7, we find that having exactly 4 true statements (and thus 3 false statements) satisfies several conditions directly.

Given the conflict with Statement 6, we must consider if there's a prime number of true statements that can satisfy all conditions.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understanding the Statements\nFirst, let's understand what each statement implies in terms of the number of true and false statements. Statement 1 implies that at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 implies that at most 3 statements are false, which means at least 4 statements are true. Statement 3 says exactly 4 statements are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 3 statements are false, which also means exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which creates an interesting dynamic since both cannot be true at the same time due to their identical implication of 4 true statements but from different perspectives. Statement 6 implies the number of true statements is a prime number, and Statement 7 implies the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Possible Truth Values\nLet's analyze the possible number of true statements based on these constraints. If exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), this satisfies Statement 1 (at least 2 true) and Statement 2 (at most 3 false, since 3 false means 4 true). However, Statement 5 creates a paradox if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are considered true because it states only one can be true. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6).\n\n## Step 3: Evaluating Statement 6 and 7\nGiven Statement 6, the possible numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7. Given Statement 7, the possible numbers of false statements are 4 or 6, since these are the composite numbers less than 7. If there are 4 false statements, then there are 3 true statements, which aligns with a prime number of true statements but contradicts the scenario where exactly 4 statements are true as per Statements 3 and 4. If there are 6 false statements, then there is 1 true statement, which does not satisfy Statement 1.\n\n## Step 4: Considering the Paradox and Constraints\nConsidering Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and knowing both imply the same outcome (4 true statements), we have a paradox if we try to satisfy both being true. However, Statement 5 itself does not directly dictate the number of true or false statements but rather the exclusivity of Statements 3 and 4's truthfulness.\n\n## Step 5: Finding a Solution\nA solution must satisfy all statements without contradiction. Given the constraints, let's examine if there's a scenario where all statements can be true without violating the rules of logic and the given constraints. Statement 3 and Statement 4 both suggest 4 true statements, which would make Statement 5's condition of exclusivity between them problematic if both are considered true. However, if exactly 4 statements are true, this satisfies Statement 1 (at least 2 true), Statement 2 (at most 3 false), and aligns with the possibility of Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) if we consider the prime number 2 or 3 as not applicable due to the higher constraint of at least 4 true statements from other statements.\n\n## Step 6: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nGiven the complexity and the constraints, especially with Statement 5 indicating that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, and considering the prime and composite constraints, we look for a scenario that fits all given statements without contradiction. The statements create a complex web of possibilities, but the key lies in satisfying the prime and composite conditions while adhering to the at least, at most, and exact conditions provided.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

However, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that 4 statements are true, which seems to create a scenario where both could potentially be true under the same condition (4 true statements), but Statement 5 explicitly states they cannot both be true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluating Statement 3 and Statement 4 Further\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 both suggest 4 true statements, we must consider the implications of each being true or false. If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true as well because it states exactly 3 are false.\n\n## Step 4: Considering the Implications of Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements must be a prime number. Since 4 is not a prime number, this creates a potential issue for both Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true because they both suggest 4 true statements. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. With 7 statements, if 4 are true, 3 are false. The number 3 is not composite; it's prime, which could potentially contradict Statement 7 if we consider 4 statements being true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluating Possible Scenarios Based on Prime and Composite Requirements\nGiven Statement 6, for the number of true statements to be prime, and considering Statement 7, for the number of false statements to be composite, we need to find a scenario that satisfies both. If 4 statements are true, we have 3 false, which doesn't fit because 3 is prime, not composite.\n\n## Step 6: Identifying Potential True Statement Counts\nThe prime numbers less than 7 (since we have 7 statements) are 2, 3, 5. Given Statement 1 (at least 4 true), only 5 true statements could potentially satisfy all conditions because it's the only prime number greater than or equal to 4 that is relevant here.\n\n## Step 7: Checking for Consistency with All Statements\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. This satisfies Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) since 2 is not considered composite in the traditional sense used here (though it's the only even prime, in this context, we're looking for numbers with more than two distinct positive divisors to be considered composite), but it actually fits the bill because we're considering the number of false statements to be small and not necessarily looking for a high number of divisors. However, the definition of composite typically refers to a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. By this strict definition, 2 is not composite; it's prime. Thus, we need to reconsider based on the strict definitions and implications of all statements.\n\n## Step 8: Reconsidering Based on Strict Definitions\nGiven the strict definitions and the need for consistency across all statements, let's re-evaluate the potential for the number of true and false statements. If 5 statements are true, this satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6. However, with 2 false statements, Statement 7 is not satisfied under a strict interpretation since 2 is prime, not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Final Evaluation for Consistency\nUpon further review, realizing the misinterpretation in Step 7 and Step 8 Correction: Identifying the Actual Possible Scenario\nGiven the constraints and correcting the misunderstanding about composite and prime numbers, we need exactly 5 true statements to satisfy the prime requirement (Statement 6) and have a composite number of false statements (Statement 7). With 5 true statements, we indeed have 2 false statements, which does not fit the composite requirement under strict definitions since 2 is prime.\n\n## Step 10: Correcting the Approach Based on Prime and Composite Definitions\nRealizing the error in interpreting the number of false statements as needing to be composite with 2 false statements (which is prime), let's correct the approach. For a scenario to satisfy all given conditions, especially with the prime and composite requirements, we need to find a fit where both Statement 6 and Statement 7 are satisfied without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means the possible number of true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that at most 7 of the 7 statements are false, which implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. However, since Statement 1 already sets a minimum of 4 true statements, the maximum number of false statements is 3.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 4 of the 7 statements are true. If this is true, then Statement 1 is also true because 4 is at least 4.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 says that exactly 3 of the 7 statements are false, which means 4 statements are true. This aligns with Statement 3, but Statement 5 indicates that only one of these can be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both Statements 3 and 4 lead to the same conclusion (4 true statements), they cannot both be true without violating Statement 5.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible number of true statements, according to this statement, could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that if Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements must be either 4 (meaning 3 true statements) or 6 (meaning 1 true statement), because these are the only composite numbers that can represent the count of false statements out of 7.\n\n## Step 8: Combining the Information\nFrom Statement 3 and Statement 4, we have a scenario where exactly 4 statements are true, which satisfies Statement 1. Statement 5 ensures that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime, which could be 2, 3, 5, or 7, but given the constraints from other statements, especially Statement 1 and the implication of Statement 5, the number of true statements being 4 does not satisfy Statement 6 directly because 4 is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 requires at least 4 true statements.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (Statement 5).\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite.\n\nThe only scenario that fits all these conditions and does not lead to a contradiction is having exactly 4 true statements (satisfying Statement 1, and by extension, could satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4 exclusively due to Statement 5), but this does not align with Statement 6 since 4 is not prime. However, considering the requirement for a prime number of true statements (Statement 6), and knowing that Statement 7 requires a composite number of false statements, we must find a scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements, the key is finding a number of true statements that is prime (Statement 6) and does not contradict other statements. Since 4 is not prime, and having exactly 3 or 5 true statements could potentially satisfy the prime condition (Statement 6), we must assess these against all other statements.\n\nFor 3 true statements (and thus 4 false, which is composite, satisfying Statement 7), this does not meet the \"at least 4 true\" requirement of Statement 1.\n\nFor 5 true statements (and thus 2 false, which is not composite, contradicting Statement 7), this meets the prime requirement of Statement 6 but does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\nGiven these constraints and the need to satisfy all statements without contradiction, we must identify a solution that fits all given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This implies the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, which means the number of true statements can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true. If this is true, then 3 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false. If this is true, then 4 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 both imply that 4 statements are true (and thus 3 are false), they essentially say the same thing about the distribution of true and false statements but from different perspectives. Therefore, if one is true, the other must also be true, which contradicts Statement 5. However, this means we have to consider the implications of Statement 5 carefully, as it seems to introduce a paradox.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This statement allows for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This means the number of false statements can be 4 or 6, implying 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\nNow, considering all these constraints together:\n\n- From **Statement 1** and **Statement 2**, we have overlapping possibilities of 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n- **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** both suggest 4 true statements, but **Statement 5** introduces a complication by suggesting only one can be true, yet they imply the same outcome.\n- **Statement 6** limits the true statements to prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- **Statement 7** limits the false statements to composite numbers (4 or 6), meaning 3 or 1 true statements.\n\nGiven these constraints and considering the apparent contradiction introduced by **Statement 5**, let's resolve the paradox:\n\nIf **Statement 3** is true (4 true statements), then **Statement 4** must also be true because it states the same thing (3 false statements imply 4 true statements). However, **Statement 5** says only one of them can be true, not both. This creates a logical inconsistency because **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** are essentially saying the same thing about the distribution of true and false statements.\n\nTo find a consistent solution, we must consider the constraints without violating the rules of logic:\n\n1. **Statement 6** (prime number of true statements) and **Statement 7** (composite number of false statements) together suggest that the only feasible scenario where both are satisfied without contradicting other statements is when there are 3 true statements (a prime number) and 4 false statements (a composite number), or other combinations that fit within the constraints of all other statements.\n\nHowever, the presence of **Statement 5** complicates direct analysis because it seems to force a choice between **Statement 3** and **Statement 4**, even though they imply the same outcome. The critical insight is recognizing that **Statement 5** cannot be true if **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** are both true, as they would be in the scenario where exactly 4 statements are true. This means we have to consider scenarios where the number of true statements aligns with all given constraints without directly violating **Statement 5**'s condition, even though **Statement 5** itself may not be true in a scenario where both **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** are true.\n\nGiven the constraints and the seeming paradox, let's simplify:\n\n- For **Statement 6** to be true (prime number of true statements), and considering **Statement 7** (composite number of false statements), the feasible scenarios under normal circumstances would be where the number of true statements is prime and the number of false statements is composite. However, the direct constraints and the apparent paradox introduced by **Statement 5** mean we have to carefully consider what scenarios satisfy all statements without contradiction.\n\nConsidering all statements and the constraints they impose, we realize that the key to solving this puzzle lies in identifying a scenario that satisfies the prime and composite conditions while also adhering to the \"at least,\" \"at most,\" \"exactly\" conditions without directly contradicting the logical structure imposed by **Statement 5**.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the puzzle's constraints, especially with **Statement 5**'s influence, suggest that finding a scenario that fits all given conditions without violating logical principles is challenging due to the inherent contradictions and complexities introduced by the interplay of these statements.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This means the number of true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 says that at most 5 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, which in turn means the number of true statements can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true. If this is true, then the number of true statements is fixed at 4.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 states that exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false. This means that exactly 4 statements are true, as there are 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply the same condition (exactly 4 true statements), making them essentially the same claim. Thus, if one is true, the other must also be true, which contradicts Statement 5's condition that they cannot both be true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 says that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 8: Considering Possible Combinations\nGiven the constraints, we need to find combinations that satisfy all conditions. Statement 5 creates a paradox with Statements 3 and 4 because it says only one can be true, but they essentially say the same thing. Thus, we must consider the feasibility of each statement being true or false based on the others.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially convey the same information (4 true statements), and given Statement 5's condition, we have a logical inconsistency if we try to make either Statement 3 or Statement 4 exclusively true without the other being true as well.\n\n## Step 10: Finding Consistent Scenarios\nConsidering all statements, the key is finding a scenario where all conditions can be met without contradiction. Given Statement 5's constraint and the fact that Statements 3 and 4 are essentially identical in their implication (4 true statements), we look for a scenario where this number of true statements satisfies other conditions as well.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for Prime and Composite Conditions\nIf exactly 4 statements are true, then 3 are false. The number 3 is a prime number, not composite, which directly contradicts Statement 7. However, the number of true statements (4) is not prime, which contradicts Statement 6.\n\n## Step 12: Reconciling Contradictions\nGiven the analysis, there's a misunderstanding in the direct application of Statement 5 with Statements 3 and 4, as they cannot both be true according to Statement 5, yet they convey the same outcome. The critical insight is recognizing the logical inconsistency this creates and evaluating the truthfulness based on the constraints provided by all statements.\n\n## Step 13: Final Evaluation\nUpon closer inspection, if we have exactly 4 true statements (as suggested by Statements 3 and 4), this satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true) and Statement 2 (since 3 false statements mean 4 true statements, which is within the \"at most 5 false\" condition). However, Statement 5's condition that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true creates a paradox since they imply the same thing. Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime, which 4 is not. Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite; with 3 false statements, this condition is not met since 3 is prime.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

It actually means we can have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 both imply exactly 4 true statements.\n- Statement 5's condition is always false because Statements 3 and 4 cannot be exclusively true; they must both be true or both be false given their content.\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 implies that the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6), meaning the number of true statements must be 3 or 1, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Find the Intersection of All Conditions\nConsidering all statements, the only condition that satisfies all given constraints without contradiction, especially considering the prime and composite conditions, is having exactly 4 true statements, as it satisfies Statements 1, 3, 4, and indirectly fits with the others when considering the logical implications and potential for truthfulness.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the analysis, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the direct application of some statements due to their logical implications. However, focusing on the critical ones:\n- Statements 3 and 4 directly imply 4 true statements.\n- Statement 6 allows for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements, but only 4 fits the specific conditions without contradiction when considering the implications of all statements together.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Given that we have at least 2 true statements (Statement 5 and potentially others), the possible numbers of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

This directly contradicts Statement 1, as Statement 1 requires at least 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 2 of the 7 statements are false, which means 5 statements must be true. This aligns with the possibility presented by Statement 1 but contradicts Statement 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the contradictions between Statements 1 and 3, and considering Statement 4's alignment with the higher number of true statements, Statement 5's truthfulness hinges on the validity of Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers relevant here (given the total number of statements is 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 6 supports the possibility of 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This means for Statement 7 to be true, there must be either 4 or 6 false statements, implying 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Consistency and Contradictions\n- Statements 1 and 3 cannot both be true.\n- Statement 4 can be true if 5 statements are true, which aligns with Statement 1's condition.\n- Statement 5's truth depends on the exclusivity of Statements 3 and 4.\n- Statement 6 allows for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 7 suggests 3 or 1 true statements for it to be true.\n\n## Step 9: Finding a Consistent Solution\nGiven the constraints:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then only 2 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 1 and aligns with Statement 6 (2 is prime) but does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 5 false statements is not composite in this context of total statements).\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true, satisfying Statement 1, and aligning with Statement 6 (5 is prime). This also means 2 statements are false, which does not directly satisfy Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite).\n- For Statement 7 to be true with a composite number of false statements, we need either 4 or 6 false statements, which translates to 3 or 1 true statements, respectively. However, this does not align with the prime number requirement of Statement 6 for the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Identifying Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements, the only scenario that seems plausible without direct contradiction (given the constraints and the need for at least one of Statements 3 or 4 to be true as per Statement 5) is having exactly 5 true statements. This would make Statement 4 true, which in turn could make Statement 5 true if Statement 3 is false. However, this creates a complex web of truth values that must be carefully considered against all statements.\n\n## Step 11: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nUpon closer inspection, the conditions imposed by Statements 1, 4, 5, and 6 can potentially be satisfied if 5 statements are true, as this would make Statement 4 true, aligning with the requirement for at least 6 true statements being impossible but fitting the \"at most 5 false\" condition of Statement 2 when considering its inverse implication. However, the exact combination that satisfies all given conditions without contradiction must be precisely determined.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This implies that at least 2 statements must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true. If this is true, then 5 statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false. If this is true, then 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means we have two scenarios to consider based on the truth of Statement 3 or Statement 4.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Relevant prime numbers here could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since we're dealing with 7 statements.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are those that have more than two factors. For 7 statements, relevant composite numbers could be 4 or 6, as 0, 1, and 7 are not composite (0 and 1 are special cases, and 7 is prime).\n\n## Step 8: Consider the Possibilities Based on the Statements\n- If Statement 3 is true (exactly 2 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false (because of Statement 5), which aligns with the condition but contradicts Statement 1 (at least 6 true).\n- If Statement 4 is true (exactly 2 false statements), then Statement 3 must be false. This scenario aligns with Statement 1 (since 5 statements would be true) and Statement 2 (since only 2 are false).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the Prime and Composite Conditions\nGiven Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) and considering the possible truths:\n- If 2 statements are true (Statement 3 is true), it doesn't align with Statement 1 or the prime condition directly since 2 is prime but contradicts the at least 6 true statements condition.\n- If 5 statements are true (Statement 4 is true), it aligns with Statement 1 and Statement 6 (since 5 is prime).\n\n## Step 10: Consider Statement 7 (Number of False Statements is Composite)\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false, which is prime, not composite, contradicting Statement 7.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate Consistency Across Statements\nGiven the analysis, we need a scenario where all true statements align without contradiction. Statement 1 and Statement 4 being true seems plausible (at least 6 true and exactly 2 false, respectively), but this creates tension with Statement 7 (since 2 false statements is not composite). However, considering all statements, the conditions around prime and composite numbers, and the constraints on the number of true and false statements, we must find a consistent set that satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\n## Step 12: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and analyzing each statement against the others, we find that having exactly 5 true statements (which makes Statement 4 true and thus Statement 3 false due to Statement 5) seems like a potential solution. However, this setup must be checked against all statements for consistency. Statement 1 (at least 6 true) cannot be satisfied if only 5 are true, indicating a potential oversight in previous steps regarding the satisfaction of all conditions simultaneously.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

However, we must verify if this scenario can satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.\n\n## Step 12: Verifying the Solution\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (Statement 3), then Statement 4 must be false (by Statement 5), which means we don't have exactly 1 false statement, fulfilling the condition that not both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n- With 5 true statements, Statement 1 (at least 3 true) and Statement 2 (at most 3 false) are both satisfied.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is a prime number.\n- For Statement 7, having 2 false statements (when 5 are true) does not directly fit because 2 is not composite.

This would make Statement 1 and Statement 2 true as well. With 6 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 would be true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not considered composite in this context, but since we are looking at the number of false statements being composite, and 1 false statement does not fit the typical definition of composite, this interpretation may seem to fail. However, the critical point here is the interplay between the statements and their implications on the total count of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 10: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nFrom the analysis, the most straightforward solution that fits all given conditions without contradiction is when Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are true, and Statements 4 and 7 are false. Other combinations either lead to contradictions or do not satisfy all given conditions simultaneously.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

However, this immediately creates a contradiction with Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. If all statements are true, then both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true, which means Statement 5 is false, contradicting the premise that all statements are true. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluating Statement 4\nGiven Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 could potentially be true, suggesting exactly 5 statements are true. This would mean Statement 5 is also true because it allows for the possibility of Statement 4 being true while Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 4: Considering the Prime Number of True Statements\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements must be a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Given Statement 3 is false, the possibility of 7 true statements is eliminated. This leaves us with the potential for 2, 3, or 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluating the Composite Number of False Statements\nStatement 7 states that the number of false statements must be a composite number. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. This means the number of false statements could be 4 (leaving 3 true statements) or 6 (leaving 1 true statement), but given the constraints from other statements, especially Statement 1 and the implication of Statement 4, we focus on the scenario where exactly 5 statements are true (and thus 2 are false), which does not directly fit the composite requirement for false statements as 2 is not composite. However, this step helps to further constrain our possible solutions.\n\n## Step 6: Combining Constraints\nGiven the constraints:\n- At least 3 statements are true (Statement 1).\n- At most 3 statements are false (Statement 2), implying at least 4 statements are true.\n- Exactly 5 statements being true (from considering Statement 4 and the implications of other statements).\n- The number of true statements must be prime (Statement 6), which supports the possibility of 5 true statements since 5 is prime.\n- The evaluation of Statement 5, which allows for Statement 4 to be true.\n\n## Step 7: Identifying Possible Solutions\nGiven these constraints and the fact that Statement 3 cannot be true, the most plausible scenario that satisfies all conditions (especially considering Statement 6 and the prime requirement) is having exactly 5 true statements.

This means we have two scenarios to consider based on the truthfulness of Statement 3 or Statement 4.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the Implications of Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 says at least 3 of these statements are true, and Statement 2 says at most 3 of these statements are false. These statements must be considered in conjunction with the others to assess their truthfulness.\n\n## Step 5: Assess Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number, and Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. These statements give us further constraints on the possible number of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 6: Determine Possible Scenarios\nGiven the constraints:\n- If Statement 3 is true, all statements must be true, which contradicts Statement 5 and the premise of Statement 4.\n- If Statement 4 is true, exactly 5 statements are true, which aligns with the possibility of Statement 6 being true since 5 is a prime number, but we must assess if this can satisfy all conditions including Statement 7.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the Validity of Each Statement Under Different Scenarios\nConsidering Statement 4's scenario where exactly 5 statements are true:\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false (2 are false in this scenario).\n- Statement 3 is false, as not all statements are true.\n- Statement 4 is true, as exactly 2 statements are false.\n- Statement 5 is true because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, and in this case, Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6 could be true if the number of true statements (5) is considered prime, but 5 is indeed prime.\n- Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is composite.

However, this creates a tension with Statement 7, as 2 false statements (a prime number) do not satisfy the condition of being composite.

However, this would mean that Statement 4, which claims exactly 2 statements are false, cannot be true if all statements are true. This creates a contradiction because Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Thus, if Statement 3 is true, it leads to a contradiction, making it impossible for all statements to be true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false. This means 5 statements are true. Given the nature of the statements, if Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false because they cannot both be true according to Statement 5. This scenario does not immediately create a contradiction and needs further examination.\n\n## Step 3: Examining the Implications of Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the analysis of Statement 3, if it were true, it would lead to a contradiction. Thus, for the statements to be consistent, Statement 4 being true is the more plausible scenario to consider, making Statement 3 false.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 says at least 3 of these statements are true, and Statement 2 says at most 3 of these statements are false. If Statement 4 is true (meaning exactly 2 statements are false), then 5 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 1 (since 5 is more than 3) and Statement 2 (since 2 false statements mean 5 true statements, which is within the \"at most 3 false\" condition when considering the inverse implication).\n\n## Step 5: Considering Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. If 5 statements are true (as per our consideration of Statement 4 being true), then this condition is met because 5 is a prime number. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. With exactly 2 statements being false, this condition is not met because 2 is a prime number, not a composite number. This creates a contradiction with our initial assumption that Statement 4 could be true without violating other conditions.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluating the Possibilities\nGiven the contradiction found in Step 5 regarding the prime and composite nature of the number of false statements, we must reconsider our approach. The initial analysis aimed to find a consistent set of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions. However, upon closer inspection, the conditions provided by the statements themselves limit the possible combinations significantly. Specifically, the interplay between Statements 3, 4, and 5, along with the constraints of Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7, suggests a narrow window for potential solutions.\n\n## Step 7: Final Analysis\nConsidering the constraints and the nature of prime and composite numbers, along with the requirements for true and false statements, it becomes apparent that finding a solution that satisfies all statements without contradiction is highly constrained. The conditions provided, especially regarding the primality of the number of true statements and the compositeness of the number of false statements, along with the exclusivity and inclusivity conditions of other statements, suggest a very specific and potentially unique solution set.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

If Statement 4 is true, then it must be one of the true statements, and there must be 3 false statements among the 7. Given that Statement 3 is false, we need to consider the implications of Statement 4 being true or false.\n\n## Step 4: Considering the Implications of Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then there are 3 false statements. Since Statement 3 is false, we need 2 more false statements. Statement 5 would be true because it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, given our current assumption that Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluating Statement 1\nStatement 1 says that at least 4 of these 7 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, and we consider Statement 5 to be true based on our assumption, then we have at least 2 true statements (Statements 4 and 5). Statement 1's truthfulness would depend on the number of true statements, which we are still evaluating.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluating Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 5 of these 7 statements are false.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible numbers of true statements that are prime and relevant here are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. The possible numbers of false statements that are composite and relevant here are 4 and 6, given that we have 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 9: Combining the Information\nGiven that Statement 3 is false, and considering Statement 4 could be true, which would make Statement 5 true, we need to find a combination that satisfies all conditions. Statement 1 requires at least 4 true statements, Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime, and Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite.\n\n## Step 10: Finding a Valid Combination\n- If Statement 4 is true, and thus Statement 5 is also true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we have 2 true statements.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- To satisfy Statement 1 (at least 4 true statements) and considering Statement 6 (the number of true statements must be prime), the only prime number greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 7 is 5 or 7.\n- For 5 true statements, this would mean 2 false statements, which contradicts Statement 7 since 2 is not a composite number.\n- For 7 true statements, this would mean 0 false statements, which also contradicts Statement 7 since 0 is not considered composite in this context, and it would make Statement 4 false.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluating Statement 4 Being False\nIf Statement 4 is false, then Statement 5 is also false because it claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, and we've established Statement 3 is false. This gives us 2 false statements so far (Statements 3 and 5).\n\n## Step 12: Considering the Total Number of True and False Statements\nWith Statement 4 being false, we need to satisfy the conditions of the other statements. Statement 1 requires at least 4 true statements, and Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n\n## Step 13: Final Evaluation\nGiven the constraints and the need for the number of true statements to be prime and the number of false statements to be composite, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n- If we have 5 true statements (a prime number), we have 2 false statements, which does not satisfy the condition that the number of false statements must be composite.\n- If we have 7 true statements, all statements must be true, which contradicts our findings that Statements 3 and 5 are false.\n\n## Step 14: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the analysis above, the only feasible scenario that could potentially satisfy all conditions, especially considering the prime number of true statements and composite number of false statements, would be having 5 true statements. However, this scenario does not satisfy the condition that the number of false statements must be composite since 2 (the number of false statements in this case) is not composite.

If Statement 4 is true (meaning exactly 3 statements are false), then at least 4 statements must be true, which supports the possibility of Statement 1 being true.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluating Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 5 of these 7 statements are false. If exactly 3 statements are false (as per Statement 4), then at most 5 being false includes the scenario where 3 are false, making Statement 2 potentially true.\n\n## Step 6: Assessing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. If exactly 3 statements are false, then 4 statements are true. However, 4 is not a prime number, which means Statement 6 cannot be true under this scenario.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluating Statement 7\nStatement 7 says that the number of false statements is a composite number. If exactly 3 statements are false, then the number of false statements (3) is not composite (since 3 is a prime number), making Statement 7 false under this scenario.\n\n## Step 8: Counting True and False Statements\nGiven the analysis:\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 could be true.\n- Statement 5 could be true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 1 could be true if at least 4 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 could be true since at most 5 statements are false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 (the potential number of true statements) is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 (the number of false statements if Statement 4 is true) is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Determining Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the fact that we have already identified some statements as false (3, 6, 7) and others as potentially true (1, 2, 4, 5), we need to find a combination that satisfies all conditions. Statement 4 being true means exactly 3 statements are false, which we've identified as Statements 3, 6, and 7. This leaves us with Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 as potentially true, satisfying the condition of at least 4 true statements (Statement 1) and at most 5 false statements (Statement 2).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This implies that either all statements are true or exactly one is false.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 states that exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.

This creates a conflict because if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Relevant prime numbers in this context could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since we're dealing with 7 statements.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. For 7 statements, the possible numbers of false statements could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, but only 4 and 6 are composite in this range (excluding 1 and the prime numbers).\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Consistency\n- If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false (and vice versa) due to Statement 5. However, Statement 3 cannot be true because it contradicts the conditions set by Statements 1 and 2, which both imply a majority or all of the statements must be true.\n- Statement 4 being true would mean 3 statements are true, which aligns with Statement 6 (since 3 is a prime number) but contradicts Statement 1 and the implication of Statement 2 that all or all but one statement must be true.\n- The truth of Statement 6 (the number of true statements is a prime number) could potentially align with Statements 1 and 2 if all statements are true (7 is a prime number), but this would make Statement 7 false since 0 false statements is not composite.\n- Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) could be true if there are 4 or 6 false statements, but this contradicts the conditions set by Statements 1 and 2.\n\n## Step 9: Finding a Consistent Solution\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 requires all statements to be true for it to be true.\n- Statement 2 allows for either all true or one false.\n- Statement 5 creates a mutual exclusivity between Statements 3 and 4.\n- Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime.\n- Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite.\n\nThe only scenario where most of these can align is if all statements are true, which would satisfy Statements 1, 2, and 6. However, this creates a problem because if all statements are true, then Statement 7 is false (since 0 false statements is not composite), and Statement 5's condition is not met in a way that creates a logical consistency without violating the conditions of Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nUpon closer examination, the only way for all conditions to be met without contradiction is actually more constrained than initially apparent. If all statements are true, it violates Statement 7. If we try to satisfy Statement 7 by having a composite number of false statements (like 4), it contradicts the prime number requirement of true statements unless we have exactly 3 true statements, which then contradicts Statements 1 and 2.\n\nGiven these constraints and the need for logical consistency, there's actually a very limited set of possible solutions that can satisfy all given conditions without contradiction. In fact, upon detailed analysis, it becomes apparent that finding a set of true and false assignments that satisfies all statements simultaneously is highly constrained and likely results in a scenario where not all statements can be true due to their mutually exclusive conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

However, this immediately creates a problem with Statements 3, 4, and 5, as they cannot all be true under this condition. Statement 6 is satisfied if all statements are true (7 true statements), and Statement 7 is satisfied if 0 statements are false (7 true statements, 0 false statements is not composite, but this condition does not directly apply as we consider the number of false statements to be composite).\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and analyzing each statement, we find that the only way for most of these statements to be logically consistent is if all of them are true, except this creates a paradox with Statements 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, we must look for a scenario that satisfies the majority without contradiction.

Given Statement 4 is true, there is exactly 1 false statement, which means Statement 7 is false because 1 is not a composite number.\n\n## Step 8: Resolving the Contradictions\nFrom the analysis, Statement 3 is false because it contradicts Statements 1 and 2.

This means Statement 4 itself, along with Statements 1, 2, and 5, must be among the true statements to fulfill the condition of exactly 6 true statements.

This directly contradicts the conditions set by both Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 1 of the 7 statements is false. This means that 6 statements are true, which aligns with the conditions of both Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the analysis, Statement 3 cannot be true because it contradicts the conditions of Statements 1 and 2, which have overlapping truth conditions with Statement 4.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Given the constraints from Statements 1 and 2, the only prime number that fits is 7 (since 5 and 6 are possible but 7 is the only prime among the options that satisfies all conditions including Statement 4).\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. If 6 statements are true (as per Statement 4), then 1 statement is false, which does not fit the composite requirement. However, if all statements but one are true (making one false), this condition is not directly relevant to determining the number of solutions given the other constraints.\n\n## Step 8: Synthesizing the Information\nFrom the analysis, Statement 3 cannot be true because it contradicts Statements 1 and 2. Statement 4 can be true, suggesting 6 true statements. Statement 5 supports this by allowing Statement 4 to be true while Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 suggests a prime number of true statements, which could be 7 if all statements including itself are true, but this creates a paradox since Statement 3 would then have to be false, and we cannot have exactly 3 true statements. Thus, the only consistent scenario under the given constraints, especially considering Statements 1, 2, 4, and 6, is having 6 true statements, which makes Statement 4 true and satisfies the prime condition of Statement 6 if we consider the possibility of 7 being a prime outcome under specific conditions.\n\n## Step 9: Determining Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the necessity for consistency across statements, the solution hinges on satisfying Statements 1, 2, 4, and 6 primarily, with Statement 5 allowing for the truth of Statement 4. The statements' truthfulness depends on the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and at least 5 (Statement 1), with at most 1 false statement (Statement 2), which aligns with exactly 6 true statements as per Statement 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Statement 4 claims exactly 3 statements are false, meaning exactly 4 statements are true. Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the implications of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true, and Statement 4 is one of the false statements. This also means Statement 5 is true because it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. With 6 true statements, Statement 1 ('At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.') is also true. Since exactly 6 are true, Statement 2 ('At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.') is also true because it allows for up to 2 false statements, which aligns with 6 true statements. Statement 6 ('The number of true statements is a prime number.') is true because 6 is not a prime number, but this creates a contradiction since we're evaluating the scenario where Statement 3 is true, implying 6 true statements, which does not fulfill Statement 6's condition of being a prime number. Thus, our initial assumption that Statement 3 can be true under these conditions leads to a contradiction when considering Statement 6.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, and exactly 4 statements are true. This means Statement 5 is true because it states either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. With 4 true statements, Statement 1 ('At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.') is true. However, Statement 2 ('At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.') would be false because it claims at most 2 statements are false, but we have 3 false statements. Statement 6 ('The number of true statements is a prime number.') would be true because 4 is not a prime number, which again creates a contradiction since we are considering the truthfulness of statements based on their claims. Statement 7 ('The number of false statements is a composite number.') would be true because 3 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number in the traditional sense used here (though in mathematics, 3 is indeed a composite number in some contexts, in the context of this problem, we're likely considering composite to mean a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself, which 3 does not have, making it prime), creating another contradiction.\n\n## Step 4: Re-evaluate the interpretation of composite and prime numbers in the context of Statement 6 and Statement 7\nGiven the standard definitions, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. By these definitions, 3 is indeed a prime number, and 4 is a composite number. Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number, and Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. If Statement 4 is true (meaning 4 statements are true and 3 are false), then Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number, and Statement 7 is false because 3 is not a composite number.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the validity of Statement 4 being true based on the analysis\nGiven the contradictions and the strict definitions of prime and composite numbers, if Statement 4 is true, it leads to inconsistencies with Statements 6 and 7 based on their claims about prime and composite numbers. Thus, our analysis must consider the implications of these statements' truthfulness carefully, focusing on the logical consistency rather than the mathematical definitions alone.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the overall consistency and possible solutions\nGiven the contradictions and complexities, let's reconsider the basic claims: Statement 3 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with Statement 6 when considering the number of true statements. Statement 4, if true, also leads to contradictions when considering the definitions of prime and composite numbers in relation to Statements 6 and 7. The key is finding a scenario where the statements do not contradict each other logically.\n\n## Step 7: Final analysis of possible true statements\nGiven the constraints and the aim for consistency, we need to identify a set of statements that can be true without contradicting each other. Statement 1 is true if at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 is true if at most 2 statements are false, which means at least 5 statements are true. Statement 5 indicates either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but given the contradictions identified, we must carefully assess the implications of each being true. Statement 6 and Statement 7 provide conditions on the number of true and false statements being prime or composite, respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Statements 4, 6, and 7 are false in this scenario. However, considering the strict definitions and implications:\n- If exactly 6 statements are true, then only 1 is false, which aligns with Statement 2 but contradicts the prime and composite requirements directly since 6 is not prime and 1 is not composite.\n- The scenario where exactly 4 statements are true (Statement 4 is true) does not satisfy all conditions because it would make Statement 6 false (4 is not prime) and does not fit the composite requirement for false statements as 3 is prime.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and analyzing each statement's impact on the others, there's a realization that the initial analysis oversimplifies the complex interplay of statements, especially regarding prime and composite numbers. The critical insight lies in the compatibility of statements under the constraints provided, particularly focusing on the truthfulness of Statements 3 and 4 as pivotal points. However, the analysis reveals a misunderstanding in directly applying these constraints to deduce a singular numerical solution without fully considering the logical implications of each statement on the others, especially regarding the prime and composite nature of true and false statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Given the contradictions with Statements 1 and 2, if either 3 or 4 were true, it would invalidate the conditions set by 1 and 2, making them false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true (by Statement 5), and given their conditions, they cannot be true alongside Statements 1 and 2 without causing a contradiction.\n- Statement 1 and Statement 2 suggest a majority of statements are true, which aligns with the possibility of 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7). Given Statement 1's requirement for at least 5 true statements, this narrows it down to 5 or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 7 indicates the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6), which aligns with having 2 or 3 false statements, thus 5 or 4 true statements, respectively. However, given the constraints from Statement 1, only 5 true statements (and thus 2 false statements) fit all conditions because 2 is not a composite number, and having 3 false statements (4 true) contradicts Statement 1.\n\nConsidering all constraints:\n- **5 true statements** satisfy Statements 1, 2, 4 (since 5 false statements would mean 2 true, but we're considering the scenario where 5 are true), 6 (since 5 is prime), and potentially 7 (since 2 false statements is not composite, this actually doesn't fit perfectly with Statement 7 upon closer inspection).\n- **Statement 3** cannot be true because it contradicts the majority being true.\n- **Statement 5** suggests either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but given the contradictions, this statement's truthfulness hinges on the validity of 3 or 4, which we've established cannot both be true and contradict other statements.\n\nUpon closer examination, the only scenario that fits without contradiction, considering the need for at least 5 true statements and the prime/composite conditions, is having **exactly 5 true statements**. However, this creates a tension with Statement 7, as 2 false statements are not composite. \n\nGiven this analysis, the solution that best fits without directly contradicting the given statements, while also considering the constraints about prime and composite numbers, suggests a narrow path where **5 statements are true**. This would make Statements 1, 2, 4, 6 potentially true (with the understanding that Statement 4's condition is about exactly 5 being false, which doesn't align with our conclusion but is considered in the analysis for thoroughness). Statement 7's condition about composite false statements isn't perfectly met in this scenario since 2 (the number of false statements if 5 are true) is not composite.\n\nHowever, realizing the oversight in reconciling all statements perfectly due to the complexity and the specific conditions provided, let's correct the approach for determining the number of possible solutions:\n\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation:\n- The conditions provided by the statements, especially considering prime and composite numbers, and the constraints on the number of true and false statements, lead to a specific set of possible outcomes.\n- The statements' interdependencies and the conditions they impose on the number of true and false statements limit the possible scenarios significantly.\n\nThus, considering all constraints and correcting for the analysis provided, the focus should be on the feasible combinations that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction, acknowledging the complexity of the problem and the need for a solution that fits within the defined parameters.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This means the number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 says that at most 4 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, which means the number of true statements can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 asserts that exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true. If this is the case, then Statement 3 itself must be the only true statement, making all other statements false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false. This means that exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This creates a condition where we have to consider the validity of Statement 3 and Statement 4 exclusively.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible prime numbers of true statements in this context can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. The possible composite numbers for false statements in this context can be 4 or 6.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating the Conditions Together\n- From Statement 1 and Statement 2, we can see that both allow for the possibility of 5, 6, or 7 true statements, but Statement 2 also includes the possibility of 3 or 4 true statements.\n- Statement 3 cannot be true because if it were, it would contradict the conditions set by Statements 1 and 2, which both suggest more than one statement can be true.\n- Statement 4 suggests 2 true statements, which contradicts Statement 1 but aligns with the possibility of Statement 2.\n- Statement 5 indicates that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. Given Statement 3's impossibility based on other conditions, we consider Statement 4.\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers, supporting the possibility of 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite, which can be 4 or 6, implying 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Identifying Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints, the only scenario that fits all possible true statements without contradiction, considering the prime number of true statements and composite number of false statements, is having 2 true statements (which makes Statement 4 true) and 5 false statements, which aligns with Statement 7's condition for composite false statements. However, we must verify if this setup violates any statement's conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Verifying the Solution Against All Statements\n- Statement 1: At least 5 true statements - This is violated because we have only 2 true statements.\n- Statement 2: At most 4 false statements - This is violated because we have 5 false statements.\n- Statement 3: Exactly 1 true statement - This is false because we have 2 true statements.\n- Statement 4: Exactly 5 false statements - This is true.\n- Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both - This is true because Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements is a prime number - This is true because 2 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements is a composite number - This is true because 5 is not composite; it's prime, indicating an error in the initial verification against Statement 7.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluating Based on Prime and Composite Conditions\nUpon re-evaluation, considering Statement 6 and Statement 7 together, we look for a scenario where the number of true statements is prime and the number of false statements is composite. The only prime number of true statements that fits within the 7 statements and aligns with at least one of the conditions (without contradicting the others) is having 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements. For the composite number of false statements, it must be 4 or 6, which implies 3 or 1 true statements, respectively. The mistake in Step 10 indicates a need to correctly align with Statement 7's condition.\n\n## Step 12: Correcting the Approach\nConsidering the need for the number of false statements to be composite (4 or 6), this implies 3 or 1 true statements, respectively. Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime. Thus, having 3 true statements (which is prime) and 4 false statements (which is composite) seems like a potential solution. This setup does not directly contradict any statement without further analysis.\n\n## Step 13: Final Analysis\nGiven the constraints and correcting the oversight:\n- Having 3 true statements and 4 false statements fits Statement 6 (prime true statements) and Statement 7 (composite false statements).\n- This scenario does not directly violate Statement 1 or Statement 2 when considering the range of possibilities they allow.\n- Statement 3 is false because there are 3 true statements.\n- Statement 4 is false because there are 4 false statements, not 5.\n- Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true exclusively in this scenario.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means the possible number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 4 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of true statements can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, since having 3 or more true statements means 4 or fewer false statements.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true. If this is the case, then Statement 3 itself must be the only true statement, which would make all other statements false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false. This means exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This creates a condition where if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Given 7 statements, the possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are numbers with more than two factors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6, since 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 are not composite (0 and 1 are special cases, 2 and 3 are prime).\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the Possibility of Each Statement Being True\n- If Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement can be true, which contradicts the conditions of Statements 1, 2, 4, and 6, making it impossible for Statement 3 to be true alone without violating the conditions of other statements.\n- Statement 4 suggests 2 true statements, which contradicts Statement 1 but could fit with Statement 6 if 2 is considered a prime number in this context (though traditionally, 2 is the smallest prime, its consideration here may depend on the definition used).\n- Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, but given the constraints, Statement 3 cannot be true without causing contradictions, leaving Statement 4 as a potential truth if it doesn't conflict with other conditions.\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers, which could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7 indicates the number of false statements must be composite, which could be 4 or 6, suggesting 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the Feasibility of Each Statement\nGiven the constraints, we need to find a scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction:\n- Statement 3 cannot be true because it leads to contradictions with Statements 1, 2, and 6.\n- Statement 4 could be true if exactly 2 statements are true, but this must be evaluated against the other statements for consistency.\n- Statements 1 and 2 together suggest a range that overlaps with the possibilities of Statements 6 and 7, but the exact number of true statements must satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate Consistency Across Statements\nConsidering Statement 5, if Statement 4 is true (meaning exactly 2 statements are true), this could potentially satisfy Statement 6 (since 2 is a prime number) but would contradict Statement 1 (which requires at least 5 true statements). Thus, we need a scenario where all conditions can be met without contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Identify Potential Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the need for consistency:\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (satisfying Statement 1 and potentially Statement 6, since 5 is prime), then Statement 4 cannot be true, which aligns with Statement 5's condition that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n- This scenario also satisfies Statement 2 (at most 4 false statements) and could fit Statement 7 if the number of false statements (2) is considered in the context of composite numbers, though traditionally, 2 is prime.\n\n## Step 12: Final Evaluation\nGiven the constraints and the process of elimination, the most feasible scenario that satisfies all statements without contradiction involves having exactly 5 true statements. This satisfies Statements 1, 2, 5 (by making Statement 4 false), and 6. However, Statement 7 poses a challenge since 2 (the number of false statements in this scenario) is not composite. This indicates a potential oversight in the analysis regarding the definition and application of prime and composite numbers in the context of this problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means 5, 6, or 7 statements could be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 4 of these 7 statements are false. This implies 3, 2, 1, or 0 statements could be false, which means 4, 5, 6, or 7 statements could be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true. If this is true, then only one statement can be true, which contradicts Statements 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false. This means 2 statements are true, which also contradicts Statement 1.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the contradictions with Statements 1 and 2, if either 3 or 4 were true, it would invalidate the conditions set by 1 and 2, making them false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true (by Statement 5), and given their conditions, they cannot be true alongside Statements 1 and 2 without causing a contradiction.\n- Statement 1 and Statement 2 suggest a majority of statements are true, which aligns with the possibility of 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7). Given Statement 1's requirement for at least 5 true statements, this narrows it down to 5 or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 7 indicates the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6), which aligns with having 2 or 3 false statements, thus 5 or 4 true statements, respectively. However, given the constraints from Statement 1, only 5 true statements (and thus 2 false statements) fit all conditions because 2 is not a composite number, and having 3 false statements (4 true) contradicts Statement 1.\n\nConsidering all constraints:\n- **5 true statements** satisfy Statements 1, 2, 4 (since 5 false statements would mean 2 true, but we're considering the scenario where 5 are true), 6 (since 5 is prime), and potentially 7 (since 2 false statements is not composite, this actually doesn't fit perfectly with Statement 7 upon closer inspection).\n- **Statement 3** cannot be true because it contradicts the majority being true.\n- **Statement 5** suggests either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but given the contradictions, this statement's truthfulness hinges on the validity of 3 or 4, which we've established cannot both be true and contradict other statements.\n\nUpon closer examination, the only scenario that fits without contradiction, considering the need for at least 5 true statements and the prime/composite conditions, is having **exactly 5 true statements**. However, this creates a tension with Statement 7, as 2 false statements are not composite. \n\nGiven this analysis, the solution that best fits without directly contradicting the given statements, while also considering the constraints about prime and composite numbers, suggests a narrow path where **5 statements are true**. This would make Statements 1, 2, 4, 6 potentially true (with the understanding that Statement 4's condition is about exactly 5 being false, which doesn't align with our conclusion but is considered in the analysis for thoroughness). Statement 7's condition about composite false statements isn't perfectly met in this scenario since 2 (the number of false statements if 5 are true) is not composite.\n\nHowever, realizing the oversight in reconciling all statements perfectly due to the complexity and the specific conditions provided, let's correct the approach for determining the number of possible solutions:\n\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation:\n- The conditions provided by the statements, especially considering prime and composite numbers, and the constraints on the number of true and false statements, lead to a specific set of possible outcomes.\n- The statements' interdependencies and the conditions they impose on the number of true and false statements limit the possible scenarios significantly.\n\nThus, considering all constraints and correcting for the analysis provided, the focus should be on the feasible combinations that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction, acknowledging the complexity of the problem and the need for a solution that fits within the defined parameters.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This scenario is plausible under Statement 2 and aligns with Statement 5's condition that either 3 or 4 could be true, but given their similarity, they cannot both be true without violating Statement 5.\n- Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime, which could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, only 5 true statements (and thus 2 false) align with the conditions set by Statements 3 and 4 without directly contradicting the others when considering the constraints.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. With 2 false statements (and 5 true), this condition is met because 2 is not composite, but this seems to be a misunderstanding in the analysis - 2 is indeed the smallest prime, not composite. The correct composite numbers for false statements in this context would be having 4 or 6 false statements, which does not align with the 5 true statements suggested by Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 9: Resolving the Paradox\nGiven the constraints and the aim for consistency:\n- Statement 1 cannot be true because it demands all statements be true, which contradicts the structure of the problem.\n- Statements 3 and 4 suggest a scenario (5 true, 2 false) that aligns with Statement 2 and could satisfy Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) but seems to conflict with the detailed analysis of composite numbers for false statements.\n- The critical insight is recognizing that Statement 5 allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, not both, suggesting a nuanced interpretation might be necessary for the set.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nGiven the above analysis and recognizing the need for a solution that satisfies the conditions without contradiction:\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), this satisfies the prime condition of Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) and aligns with Statement 2. However, the analysis on composite numbers was initially misapplied regarding the definition and implications for false statements.\n- The actual composite number condition for false statements (Statement 7) and the prime number condition for true statements (Statement 6) need careful consideration. Given 5 true statements, we have 2 false, which does not fit the composite requirement as initially misinterpreted. The correct approach should focus on the feasibility of the statements' conditions being met without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This implies that 5 or more statements must be true, since having 3 or more false statements would violate this condition.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly contradicts Statement 1, which requires all statements to be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 states 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means exactly 5 statements are true, which aligns with Statement 3 but contradicts Statement 1.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statements 3 and 4 essentially say the same thing (5 true statements), they cannot both be true without violating the principle of this statement.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Given that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself, the possible numbers of true statements that are prime from 1 to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 states 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6, since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Consistency Across Statements\n- Statement 1 requires all statements to be true, which contradicts the premise of Statements 3, 4, and the implication of Statement 5.\n- Statements 3 and 4 both suggest 5 true statements, which would make 2 statements false. This scenario is plausible under Statement 2 and aligns with Statement 5's condition that either 3 or 4 could be true, but given their similarity, they cannot both be true without violating Statement 5.\n- Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime, which could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, only 5 true statements (and thus 2 false) align with the conditions set by Statements 3 and 4 without directly contradicting the others when considering the constraints.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. With 2 false statements (and 5 true), this condition is met because 2 is not composite, but this seems to be a misunderstanding in the analysis - 2 is indeed the smallest prime, not composite. The correct composite numbers for false statements in this context would be having 4 or 6 false statements, which does not align with the 5 true statements suggested by Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 9: Resolving the Paradox\nGiven the constraints and the aim for consistency:\n- Statement 1 cannot be true because it demands all statements be true, which contradicts the structure of the problem.\n- Statements 3 and 4 suggest a scenario (5 true, 2 false) that aligns with Statement 2 and could satisfy Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) but seems to conflict with the detailed analysis of composite numbers for false statements.\n- The critical insight is recognizing that Statement 5 allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, not both, suggesting a nuanced interpretation might be necessary for the set.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nGiven the above analysis and recognizing the need for a solution that satisfies the conditions without contradiction:\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), this satisfies the prime condition of Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) and aligns with Statement 2. However, the analysis on composite numbers was initially misapplied regarding the definition and implications for false statements.\n- The actual composite number condition for false statements (Statement 7) and the prime number condition for true statements (Statement 6) need careful consideration. Given 5 true statements, we have 2 false, which does not fit the composite requirement as initially misinterpreted. The correct approach should focus on the feasibility of the statements' conditions being met without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This would mean Statements 3, 4, and 6 are true, along with one more statement that must be true to satisfy the \"at least\" and \"exactly\" conditions without contradicting the prime and composite number requirements. However, given the logical inconsistencies and the fact that Statements 3 and 4 are essentially saying the same thing, making Statement 5's \"but not both\" clause problematic, we must consider which statements can logically coexist.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means at least 5 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then all statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This creates a contradiction with Statement 3 because if Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true, which would also make Statement 4 false, fulfilling this condition. However, Statement 4 cannot be true because it contradicts Statement 3 directly, and if Statement 4 were true, then Statement 3 would be false, which aligns with this statement but creates a paradox when considering the truthfulness of all statements.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible numbers of true statements (out of 7) that are prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers are those that have at least one divisor other than 1 and themselves. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6 (since 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite or are not applicable in this context as they do not fulfill the conditions of being composite).\n\nGiven these statements, let's find inconsistencies and consistencies:\n\n- **Statement 3 and Statement 4** cannot both be true because they contradict each other directly. Statement 5 says only one of them can be true, but given their nature, if Statement 3 is true, all statements must be true, which contradicts the premise of Statement 5 allowing for an either-or scenario since Statement 4 would necessarily be false.\n\n- **Statement 1** implies all statements are true, which aligns with **Statement 3** but contradicts the premise of **Statement 4** and the conditional exclusivity stated in **Statement 5**.\n\n- **Statement 6** suggests the number of true statements must be a prime number. If all statements are true (7 true), this fulfills Statement 6. However, if only 2 statements are true (to fulfill Statement 4), this also fulfills Statement 6.\n\n- **Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be composite. If all statements are true, there are 0 false statements, which does not fulfill the composite requirement. If exactly 2 statements are true (and thus 5 are false), 5 is not composite in the context usually considered for such problems (though technically, it's a special case often not highlighted in basic number theory as composite in the traditional sense used here), but in our scenario, considering typical definitions, we focus on numbers like 4 and 6 as composite.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's evaluate possible scenarios:\n\n1. **All statements are true**: This fulfills Statements 1, 3, and 6 directly. However, it contradicts Statement 4 and the spirit of Statement 5 (since both cannot be true, and one must be false, but in this scenario, Statement 3 being true necessitates Statement 4 being false, which technically fulfills Statement 5 but under a scenario where all statements cannot logically coexist as true due to the inherent contradictions).\n\n2. **Exactly 2 statements are true**: This could fulfill Statements 4 and 6 but would contradict Statements 1 and 3 directly. It also does not align with the typical expectation for Statement 7, as 5 false statements might not be considered composite in a strict, traditional sense, though it's a bit of a semantic argument.\n\nGiven the constraints and analyzing for logical consistency:\n\n- The only logically consistent scenario where all statements could potentially align without direct contradiction (considering the constraints and aiming for a scenario where as many statements as possible are true without violating their premises) is when **all statements are true**. However, this scenario is problematic because it necessitates that Statement 4 is false, which aligns with the conditional of Statement 5 but creates a logical inconsistency when considering the truth values of all statements simultaneously.\n\n- Upon closer inspection, **Statement 5** introduces a condition that cannot be fulfilled without creating a paradox when considering the truthfulness of all statements. If Statement 3 is true, all statements must be true, which makes Statement 4 false, but this scenario cannot logically coexist with the premise that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, as it implies a condition where both cannot be true, yet for all statements to be true, Statement 3 must be true, and thus Statement 4 must be false, which technically fulfills Statement 5 but under a logically inconsistent framework.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the scenario where **all statements are true** seems like the only possible solution at first glance because it fulfills the most statements directly (Statements 1, 3, and 6). However, upon deeper analysis, the introduction of Statement 5 and the conditions around Statements 3 and 4 create a logical inconsistency that makes it challenging to assert that all statements can indeed be true without violating the principles of logic, especially considering the conditional exclusivity stated in Statement 5.\n\nThus, considering the logical inconsistencies and the conditions provided, the analysis reveals a complex scenario where determining a straightforward solution that fulfills all conditions without contradiction becomes challenging due to the nature of the statements provided.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This means all statements must be true for this statement to be true because if any are false, it cannot meet the \"at least 7\" criteria since there are only 7 statements in total.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This statement directly implies that all statements are true, which aligns with the implication of Statement 1 but directly states the outcome.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 implies all statements are true, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false. Statement 4 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false,' which cannot be true if all statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating the Truthfulness of Statements\nIf all statements are true (as per Statements 1 and 3), then Statement 4 must be false. However, Statement 5 allows for only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true. Since Statement 3 and Statement 1 essentially demand all statements to be true for them to be true, and given the structure of the statements, we must assess the feasibility of all being true.\n\n## Step 5: Assessing Feasibility\n- Statement 1 can only be true if all statements are true.\n- Statement 3 directly states all statements are true.\n- Statement 5 allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, not both. If Statement 3 is true, then all statements must be true, making Statement 4 false.\n- Statement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false,' which would be true if all statements are true.\n- Statement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' If all statements are true, then 7 (the number of true statements) is indeed a prime number.\n- Statement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' If all statements are true, then there are 0 false statements. However, 0 is not considered a composite number in typical mathematical definitions, which could pose a problem.\n\n## Step 6: Conclusion on Statement 7\nGiven that 0 is not typically considered composite and the conditions that all statements must be true for Statements 1 and 3 to hold, Statement 7 poses a challenge because it implies there should be a composite number of false statements. However, if all statements are true, there are 0 false statements, which does not fit the typical definition of composite.\n\n## Step 7: Re-evaluating Based on Statement 7\nConsidering the strict definitions, if all statements are true, Statement 7's condition about the number of false statements being composite cannot be met because 0 false statements do not constitute a composite number. This creates a contradiction with the initial assumption that all statements could be true based on Statements 1 and 3.\n\n## Step 8: Final Assessment\nGiven the analysis, the only way for all conditions to potentially align without contradiction is if the statements that demand all statements to be true (Statements 1 and 3) are considered under the constraint of Statement 5, which allows for one of them to be true. However, the contradiction arises with Statement 7 when assuming all statements are true. Thus, we must consider if there's a scenario where these statements can coexist without violating their own conditions, especially considering the prime and composite conditions.\n\n## Step 9: Considering Alternatives\nIf not all statements are true, then Statement 1 cannot be true, which immediately creates a problem because Statement 1 must be true for the initial condition to hold. This means our analysis must focus on the feasibility of all statements being true under the given constraints and the specific definitions of prime and composite numbers.\n\n## Step 10: Final Consideration of Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime, and Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. If all statements are true, Statement 6 is satisfied (7 is prime), but Statement 7 is not because 0 is not considered composite.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This scenario satisfies Statement 1 (at least 1 true), Statement 2 (at most 3 false), and Statement 5 (if Statement 4 is false). However, it must be evaluated against the other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating the Possibility of Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, and 4 are true.

If Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are true, which is not a prime number, creating a contradiction. If Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are true, which is also not a prime number, again creating a contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluating Against Statement 7\nStatement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite.

Since Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we must evaluate their implications. If Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are true, which means Statement 4 is false because it claims 3 statements are false (which would be 4 true statements, not 6). Conversely, if Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, meaning 4 statements are true, which again contradicts Statement 3's claim of 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate Statement 3's claim of exactly 6 true statements\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 6 out of the 7 statements must be true. This means only 1 statement can be false. Given Statement 3's truth, Statement 4 must be the false one because it contradicts Statement 3. However, this creates a problem because Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, would also be true, and so would Statement 1 (at least 1 true), and Statement 2 (at most 3 false, which aligns with 6 true). Statement 6 would be false because 6 is not a prime number, and Statement 7 would be true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number, it's a special case but in this context, considering the common definition of composite numbers (a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself), 1 false statement does not fit the typical understanding of composite. However, the critical insight here is recognizing the constraints and implications of these statements on each other.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate Statement 4's claim of exactly 3 false statements\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, and 4 statements are true. This scenario makes Statement 3 false because it claims 6 true statements. Statement 5 would be true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true. Statement 2 is also true because at most 3 statements are false. Statement 6 would be true because 4 (the number of true statements in this scenario) is not a prime number, but this actually contradicts our premise since we are evaluating the truthfulness based on the number of true statements being prime. Statement 7 would be true because 3 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number in the traditional sense used here, but again, this step involves understanding the interplay and potential contradictions among the statements.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the feasibility of each statement being true or false based on the given conditions\nGiven the above analysis, the key is identifying which statements can coexist as true without contradicting each other or the conditions provided. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true due to Statement 5. If Statement 3 is true, it forces a specific distribution of true and false statements that seems plausible at first but leads to contradictions when considering the prime and composite conditions. If Statement 4 is true, it also forces a specific distribution but runs into issues with the prime number condition for true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the prime and composite conditions\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. The only prime numbers relevant here are 2, 3, 5, and 7 (since we have 7 statements in total). Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are those with more than two factors, like 4 or 6. Given these conditions, we must find a scenario where both can be satisfied without contradicting the other statements.\n\n## Step 6: Synthesize the information to find possible solutions\nConsidering all constraints, especially the prime and composite conditions, and the fact that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, we look for a distribution of true and false statements that satisfies all conditions without contradiction. Given the complexity and the constraints, the solution must align with the logical possibilities that do not violate the rules of prime and composite numbers or the specific claims of the statements themselves.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means that it's possible for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or all 7 statements to be true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 says that at most 3 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that 4, 5, 6, or all 7 statements must be true, since having 4 or more true statements means 3 or fewer false statements.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 6 of the 7 statements are true. If this is true, then only one statement is false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 states that exactly 3 of the 7 statements are false. This means that 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This creates a condition where we have to consider the scenarios where either exactly 6 statements are true (and thus 1 is false) or exactly 4 statements are true (and thus 3 are false), but not both conditions being true at the same time.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 says that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that the number of false statements could be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements could be 3 or 1, respectively.\n\n## Step 8: Combining the Information\nFrom Statement 3 and Statement 4, combined with Statement 5, we have two main scenarios to consider: one where 6 statements are true (and 1 is false), and one where 4 statements are true (and 3 are false). Statement 6 limits the possibilities to prime numbers of true statements (2, 3, 5, 7), and Statement 7 limits the possibilities to composite numbers of false statements (4 or 6), which translates to 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Consistency\nGiven Statement 5, if Statement 3 is true (6 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false. Conversely, if Statement 4 is true (4 true statements), then Statement 3 must be false. Statement 6 and Statement 7 further constrain the possibilities but must be consistent with the conditions set by Statements 1 through 5.\n\n## Step 10: Checking for Self-Consistency and Logical Outcomes\nConsidering all statements, we must find a scenario where all conditions are met without contradiction. Statement 3 (6 true statements) would mean Statement 4 is false, and vice versa. Given the constraints, especially from Statements 6 and 7, we need to find which of these scenarios (if any) can satisfy all given conditions without leading to a logical contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Final Evaluation\n- If 6 statements are true (Statement 3), then Statement 4 is false, which aligns with Statement 5. However, this scenario does not satisfy Statement 7 because 1 false statement is not a composite number.\n- If 4 statements are true (Statement 4), then 3 are false, which satisfies Statement 7 (since 3 is not a composite number in the context of this problem, it seems there was an oversight in initial analysis regarding composite numbers; 3 is not composite, it's prime). This also aligns with Statement 5 but does not satisfy Statement 6 directly because 4 is not a prime number.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon careful consideration, the oversight in analysis regarding prime and composite numbers, and the specific conditions of each statement, the solution must satisfy all given constraints without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means the minimum number of true statements is 3.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that the maximum number of false statements is 3, meaning the minimum number of true statements is 4 (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then 3 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 4 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This means only one of the conditions (Exactly 4 true or Exactly 3 false) can be true, not both. However, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply the same thing (4 true statements and 3 false statements), so they are essentially saying the same thing, making Statement 5 always false if either 3 or 4 is true because they cannot both be false if one of them is true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nFrom Statement 2 and Statement 1, we can infer that there must be at least 4 true statements (because at most 3 can be false, which means at least 4 must be true). \n\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statement 3), then 3 are false. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 3 true), Statement 2 (at most 3 false), and Statement 4 (exactly 3 false). It also satisfies Statement 6 (4 true statements, and 4 is not prime, so this statement would be false) and Statement 7 (3 false statements, and 3 is not composite, it's prime, so this statement would also be false). However, since Statement 5 claims that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, and they essentially state the same outcome (4 true, 3 false), this creates a contradiction because Statement 5 must be false for either 3 or 4 to be true.\n\nGiven these constraints and analyzing the statements:\n\n- **For Statement 3 to be true (Exactly 4 true)**: This would mean Statement 4 is also essentially true (since 4 true means 3 false), which contradicts Statement 5. Thus, if Statement 3 is true, we have a contradiction because Statement 5 cannot be true.\n\n- **Considering Statement 6 (The number of true statements is a prime number)**: For the number of true statements to be prime, it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, from our analysis, having exactly 2 or 3 true statements contradicts the minimum requirements set by Statement 1 and Statement 2. Having exactly 7 true statements would mean 0 false statements, which also contradicts the conditions set by other statements, especially since Statement 5 would be false (as neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 would be true), and Statement 7 would be false (0 is not composite).\n\n- **Considering Statement 7 (The number of false statements is a composite number)**: For the number of false statements to be composite, it could be 4 or 6. If there are 4 false statements, then there are 3 true statements, which contradicts our initial deduction that there must be at least 4 true statements based on Statement 2. If there are 6 false statements, then there is 1 true statement, which directly contradicts Statement 1.\n\nGiven these constraints and the fact that Statement 5 must be false for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be considered true (but they essentially state the same condition), we find that the only scenario that could potentially satisfy all given statements without direct contradiction is having exactly 4 true statements and 3 false statements. However, this creates a problem with Statement 5 being false, which is a given if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\nThus, the analysis shows that there's a complex interplay of conditions, but essentially, we are looking for a scenario where all statements can be satisfied without contradiction. The critical insight is recognizing that some statements (like Statement 5) must be false for others to be true, and this leads to a limited set of possible solutions.\n\nGiven the above analysis and the constraints provided by each statement, let's consider the potential solutions:\n\n1. **Exactly 4 true and 3 false** seems like a potential solution but creates issues with Statement 5 and the truthfulness of Statements 6 and 7.\n\nUpon careful consideration, the constraints provided make it challenging to satisfy all statements without any contradiction, given the interplay between them, especially with Statement 5 indicating that only one of two essentially identical conditions can be true.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

However, Statement 6 allows for 3 true statements to be a possibility (since 3 is prime), which would make Statement 4 false (because it says exactly 3 statements are false, implying 4 are true). But if we have exactly 3 true statements, Statement 1 is satisfied, Statement 2 is not (since 4 false statements would contradict \"at most 3 false\"), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true exclusively, Statement 6 is satisfied (3 true statements, a prime number), and Statement 7 is satisfied (4 false statements, a composite number).\n\n## Step 11: Conclusion\nGiven the above analysis, the only way all statements can be consistent without contradiction is if exactly 3 statements are true. This makes Statement 1 true, Statement 6 true, and Statement 7 true. The rest must be false to satisfy the conditions given, especially Statement 5, which allows for only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but our scenario requires both to be false to avoid contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nFrom Statement 2 and Statement 1, we can infer that there must be at least 4 true statements (because at most 3 can be false, which means at least 4 must be true). \n\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statement 3), then 3 are false. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 3 true), Statement 2 (at most 3 false), and Statement 4 (exactly 3 false). It also satisfies Statement 6 (4 true statements, and 4 is not prime, so this statement would be false) and Statement 7 (3 false statements, and 3 is not composite, it's prime, so this statement would also be false). However, since Statement 5 claims that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, and they essentially state the same outcome (4 true, 3 false), this creates a contradiction because Statement 5 must be false for either 3 or 4 to be true.\n\nGiven these constraints and analyzing the statements:\n\n- **For Statement 3 to be true (Exactly 4 true)**: This would mean Statement 4 is also essentially true (since 4 true means 3 false), which contradicts Statement 5. Thus, if Statement 3 is true, we have a contradiction because Statement 5 cannot be true.\n\n- **Considering Statement 6 (The number of true statements is a prime number)**: For the number of true statements to be prime, it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, from our analysis, having exactly 2 or 3 true statements contradicts the minimum requirements set by Statement 1 and Statement 2. Having exactly 7 true statements would mean 0 false statements, which also contradicts the conditions set by other statements, especially since Statement 5 would be false (as neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 would be true), and Statement 7 would be false (0 is not composite).\n\n- **Considering Statement 7 (The number of false statements is a composite number)**: For the number of false statements to be composite, it could be 4 or 6. If there are 4 false statements, then there are 3 true statements, which contradicts our initial deduction that there must be at least 4 true statements based on Statement 2. If there are 6 false statements, then there is 1 true statement, which directly contradicts Statement 1.\n\nGiven these constraints and the fact that Statement 5 must be false for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be considered true (but they essentially state the same condition), we find that the only scenario that could potentially satisfy all given statements without direct contradiction is having exactly 4 true statements and 3 false statements. However, this creates a problem with Statement 5 being false, which is a given if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\nThus, the analysis shows that there's a complex interplay of conditions, but essentially, we are looking for a scenario where all statements can be satisfied without contradiction. The critical insight is recognizing that some statements (like Statement 5) must be false for others to be true, and this leads to a limited set of possible solutions.\n\nGiven the above analysis and the constraints provided by each statement, let's consider the potential solutions:\n\n1. **Exactly 4 true and 3 false** seems like a potential solution but creates issues with Statement 5 and the truthfulness of Statements 6 and 7.\n\nUpon careful consideration, the constraints provided make it challenging to satisfy all statements without any contradiction, given the interplay between them, especially with Statement 5 indicating that only one of two essentially identical conditions can be true.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

If this were true, it would mean that Statement 3 itself is the only true statement, and all other statements, including Statement 1 and Statement 2, are false. However, this contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2, which cannot both be false if Statement 3 is true because Statement 1 requires at least 3 true statements, and Statement 2 requires at most 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 1 of the 7 statements is false.

However, Statement 3 being true would create a contradiction with the conditions set by Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers that could represent the number of true statements out of 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Composite numbers are those that have more than two factors. For 7 statements, the possible number of false statements could be 4 or 6 (since 4 and 6 are composite numbers less than 7). This translates to having 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 8: Combining the Information\nConsidering all statements, we need to find a scenario that satisfies the conditions without creating a paradox.

Statement 4 being true (6 true statements) satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2 but we must consider the implications of the other statements.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Possible Solutions\n- If Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), it satisfies Statement 1 (at least 3 true) and Statement 2 (at most 2 false). It also satisfies Statement 5 (since Statement 3 cannot be true). However, having 6 true statements means 1 false statement, which does not satisfy Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite). But, let's evaluate the prime condition: 6 is not a prime number, so it doesn't satisfy Statement 6 directly. Yet, we must consider the intersection of all conditions.\n- For Statement 6 to be true (prime number of true statements), and considering Statement 1 and Statement 2, the only possible prime number of true statements that satisfies all conditions including having at most 2 false statements (Statement 2) is 5 or 7 true statements. However, 7 true statements would mean 0 false statements, which is not composite, contradicting Statement 7.\n\n## Step 10: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints, especially from Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and the requirement for the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7), and considering Statement 1 and Statement 2, we find that:\n- Having 5 true statements satisfies Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and results in 2 false statements, which is not composite, thus not satisfying Statement 7 directly. However, it's the closest scenario that doesn't immediately contradict other statements.\n- Having 7 true statements (which satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2) would mean 0 false statements, which does not satisfy Statement 7 since 0 is not composite.\n\n## Step 11: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the analysis, the scenario that best fits without immediate contradiction, considering the need for a prime number of true statements and the constraints from other statements, seems to be having 5 true statements. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 3 true), Statement 2 (at most 2 false), and Statement 6 (prime number of true statements). However, it's crucial to note that this creates a tension with Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite), as 2 is not composite. Yet, this appears to be the least contradictory scenario under the given constraints.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means all statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This statement creates a condition where only one of the scenarios presented by Statements 3 and 4 can occur.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Relevant prime numbers in this context (considering the total number of statements is 7) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are numbers with more than two divisors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers (considering the number of false statements) could be 4 or 6 (since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite).\n\nGiven these conditions, let's look for consistency:\n\n- **From Statement 5**, either exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3) or exactly 7 statements are true (Statement 4), but not both.\n\n- **Statement 3** being true means 6 true statements and 1 false statement. This scenario is supported by Statement 1 and contradicts Statement 4. \n\n- **Statement 4** being true means all 7 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and supports Statement 1.\n\nConsidering **Statement 6**, for the number of true statements to be a prime number, it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, Statement 1 restricts the minimum to 6, making 7 the only viable prime number for the number of true statements if all statements were true (which would validate Statement 4).\n\n**Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be composite. If there are 6 true statements (and thus 1 false statement), it doesn't fit because 1 is not composite. However, if all statements are true (7 true, 0 false), it also doesn't fit directly because 0 is neither composite nor prime in most mathematical contexts, but here it's about the condition of being composite which doesn't apply to 0 false statements in a direct sense relevant to our analysis.\n\nGiven these constraints:\n\n- **Scenario where Statement 3 is true (6 true, 1 false)**: This fits Statement 1, contradicts Statement 4, and doesn't directly align with Statement 6 since 6 is not a prime number. It also doesn't fit Statement 7 because 1 false statement is not composite.\n\n- **Scenario where Statement 4 is true (7 true, 0 false)**: This fits Statement 1, Statement 6 (since 7 is prime), but creates a contradiction with Statement 3 and doesn't directly apply to Statement 7 in a meaningful way since 0 false statements don't satisfy the composite condition in the context of counting false statements as composite.\n\nHowever, considering all statements must adhere to logical consistency and the constraints provided:\n\n- If **Statement 4** is true, then all statements are true, which immediately creates a problem because Statement 3 cannot be true if Statement 4 is true, according to Statement 5. Thus, we have a logical contradiction if we assume all statements can be true without violating the conditions set by Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n\n- The **only scenario that doesn't immediately create a logical contradiction** involves Statement 3 being true, which means exactly 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. This setup must satisfy all other conditions without causing a paradox.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need for logical consistency across all statements, the scenario that fits without immediate contradiction involves exactly 6 true statements and 1 false statement, as per Statement 3. However, finding a configuration that satisfies all given statements without any contradiction proves to be challenging due to the interdependencies and exclusivities stated, particularly between Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the conditions provided by the statements, especially the interplay between Statements 3, 4, and 5, and the requirements for prime and composite numbers of true and false statements, respectively, suggest a **logical puzzle** where the solution must satisfy all given constraints simultaneously.\n\nFor **Statement 3** to be true (6 true statements), and considering **Statement 5** (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both), if we assume Statement 3 is the true one, then Statement 4 must be false. This creates a scenario where we have to carefully select which statements are true to satisfy the \"at least 6 true\" condition from Statement 1, the prime condition from Statement 6, and the composite condition from Statement 7, all while adhering to the exclusivity stated in Statement 5.\n\nHowever, the conditions given, especially with Statement 6 requiring the number of true statements to be prime and Statement 7 requiring the number of false statements to be composite, along with the constraints from Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5, lead to a **complex logical analysis**.\n\nThe critical insight comes from recognizing the **constraints and their implications**:\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers, but given the context, only 7 (all true) fits the prime requirement directly.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite, which is directly achievable with 4 or 6 false statements, but given the other constraints, especially from Statements 1 and 3, we are looking at a scenario of 1 false statement (from Statement 3) which does not satisfy the composite requirement directly.\n\nConsidering the logical constraints and the need for consistency across all statements, the puzzle essentially asks for a configuration that may not directly satisfy all conditions without creating a paradox, especially when considering the prime and composite requirements alongside the true/false statement counts.\n\nGiven the above analysis and the specific conditions of each statement, the puzzle presents a **challenge in satisfying all conditions simultaneously** without violating logical consistency, particularly due to the constraints imposed by the prime and composite number requirements and the exclusivity between certain statements.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This implies that the number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 6 of the 7 statements are true. This directly specifies the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 0 of the 7 statements are false, which means all statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means we have two possible scenarios: one where exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3 is true) and one where all 7 statements are true (Statement 4 is true), but these scenarios cannot both be true at the same time.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers relevant to the possible counts of true statements (5, 6, or 7) are 5 and 7, since 6 is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. For 7 statements, if 6 are true, then 1 is false (not composite), and if 5 are true, then 2 are false (which is the smallest composite number).\n\n## Step 8: Considering the Implications of Statement 5\nGiven Statement 5, we can deduce that if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. If Statement 3 is true (exactly 6 statements are true), then Statement 4 (exactly 0 statements are false) cannot be true, which fits because if 6 are true, 1 must be false. Conversely, if Statement 4 is true (all statements are true), then Statement 3 cannot be true, which also fits because if all are true, then exactly 7 statements are true, not 6.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating the Consistency of Statements\n- If all statements are true (Statement 4 is true), then Statement 3 must be false, which immediately creates a contradiction because Statement 5 allows for only one of them to be true, but in this scenario, both cannot be true as per Statement 5's condition.\n- If exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3 is true), then Statement 4 must be false. This scenario allows for Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6 (if we consider 5 true statements as a possibility due to the prime condition, but this contradicts our current assumption of exactly 6 being true) to potentially be true. However, Statement 7 cannot be true under this condition because 1 false statement is not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Resolving the Paradox\nThe only way for Statement 5 to hold true without contradiction is if exactly 6 statements are true, making Statement 3 true and Statement 4 false. However, this creates tension with Statement 7, which requires the number of false statements to be composite. Given that we have 1 false statement in this scenario, which is not composite, we must reconsider our interpretation of the statements' truthfulness.\n\n## Step 11: Reconsidering Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime. Given that 7 is a prime number, if all statements were true, this would satisfy Statement 6. However, Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. If all statements are true, then there are 0 false statements, which does not satisfy the definition of composite since 0 is not considered composite in this context.\n\n## Step 12: Finalizing the Solution\nUpon closer inspection, the conditions imposed by the statements, especially the requirement for the number of true statements to be prime and the number of false statements to be composite, along with the constraints provided by Statements 1 through 5, suggest a specific solution that satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means the number of true statements can be 6 or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 2 of these 7 statements are false. This implies the number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true. This directly specifies that one statement is false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false. This means all statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This statement creates a condition where only one of the scenarios presented by Statements 3 and 4 can occur.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Relevant prime numbers in this context (considering the total number of statements is 7) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are numbers with more than two divisors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers (considering the number of false statements) could be 4 or 6 (since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite).\n\nGiven these conditions, let's look for consistency:\n\n- **From Statement 5**, either exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3) or exactly 7 statements are true (Statement 4), but not both.\n\n- **Statement 3** being true means 6 true statements and 1 false statement. This scenario is supported by Statement 1 and contradicts Statement 4. \n\n- **Statement 4** being true means all 7 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and supports Statement 1.\n\nConsidering **Statement 6**, for the number of true statements to be a prime number, it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, Statement 1 restricts the minimum to 6, making 7 the only viable prime number for the number of true statements if all statements were true (which would validate Statement 4).\n\n**Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be composite. If there are 6 true statements (and thus 1 false statement), it doesn't fit because 1 is not composite. However, if all statements are true (7 true, 0 false), it also doesn't fit directly because 0 is neither composite nor prime in most mathematical contexts, but here it's about the condition of being composite which doesn't apply to 0 false statements in a direct sense relevant to our analysis.\n\nGiven these constraints:\n\n- **Scenario where Statement 3 is true (6 true, 1 false)**: This fits Statement 1, contradicts Statement 4, and doesn't directly align with Statement 6 since 6 is not a prime number. It also doesn't fit Statement 7 because 1 false statement is not composite.\n\n- **Scenario where Statement 4 is true (7 true, 0 false)**: This fits Statement 1, Statement 6 (since 7 is prime), but creates a contradiction with Statement 3 and doesn't directly apply to Statement 7 in a meaningful way since 0 false statements don't satisfy the composite condition in the context of counting false statements as composite.\n\nHowever, considering all statements must adhere to logical consistency and the constraints provided:\n\n- If **Statement 4** is true, then all statements are true, which immediately creates a problem because Statement 3 cannot be true if Statement 4 is true, according to Statement 5. Thus, we have a logical contradiction if we assume all statements can be true without violating the conditions set by Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n\n- The **only scenario that doesn't immediately create a logical contradiction** involves Statement 3 being true, which means exactly 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. This setup must satisfy all other conditions without causing a paradox.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need for logical consistency across all statements, the scenario that fits without immediate contradiction involves exactly 6 true statements and 1 false statement, as per Statement 3. However, finding a configuration that satisfies all given statements without any contradiction proves to be challenging due to the interdependencies and exclusivities stated, particularly between Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the conditions provided by the statements, especially the interplay between Statements 3, 4, and 5, and the requirements for prime and composite numbers of true and false statements, respectively, suggest a **logical puzzle** where the solution must satisfy all given constraints simultaneously.\n\nFor **Statement 3** to be true (6 true statements), and considering **Statement 5** (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both), if we assume Statement 3 is the true one, then Statement 4 must be false. This creates a scenario where we have to carefully select which statements are true to satisfy the \"at least 6 true\" condition from Statement 1, the prime condition from Statement 6, and the composite condition from Statement 7, all while adhering to the exclusivity stated in Statement 5.\n\nHowever, the conditions given, especially with Statement 6 requiring the number of true statements to be prime and Statement 7 requiring the number of false statements to be composite, along with the constraints from Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5, lead to a **complex logical analysis**.\n\nThe critical insight comes from recognizing the **constraints and their implications**:\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers, but given the context, only 7 (all true) fits the prime requirement directly.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite, which is directly achievable with 4 or 6 false statements, but given the other constraints, especially from Statements 1 and 3, we are looking at a scenario of 1 false statement (from Statement 3) which does not satisfy the composite requirement directly.\n\nConsidering the logical constraints and the need for consistency across all statements, the puzzle essentially asks for a configuration that may not directly satisfy all conditions without creating a paradox, especially when considering the prime and composite requirements alongside the true/false statement counts.\n\nGiven the above analysis and the specific conditions of each statement, the puzzle presents a **challenge in satisfying all conditions simultaneously** without violating logical consistency, particularly due to the constraints imposed by the prime and composite number requirements and the exclusivity between certain statements.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the number of true statements could be any of these, but given the constraints of other statements, we need to find which of these primes satisfy all conditions.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This statement implies that the number of false statements must be one of these, limiting the possibilities further.\n\nGiven these conditions:\n- **From Statement 3 and Statement 4**, along with **Statement 5**, we have a scenario where exactly 4 statements are true (and thus 3 are false), which satisfies Statement 5's condition that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n- **Statement 6** requires the number of true statements to be a prime number. With 4 true statements, this condition is not met because 4 is not a prime number.\n- **Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be a composite number. With 3 false statements, this condition is not met because 3 is not a composite number.\n\nHowever, let's correct the analysis based on the conditions given:\n- If exactly 4 statements are true, it satisfies Statement 3 (and by implication, Statement 4, but Statement 5 says only one can be true). However, 4 is not a prime number, so it does not satisfy Statement 6.\n- The only prime number of true statements that also makes the number of false statements composite is having 5 true statements (which is a prime scenario for true statements) and 2 false statements (which does not satisfy the composite condition for false statements since 2 is not composite) or having 2 true statements and 5 false statements (which does satisfy the composite condition for false statements since 4 is the composite number of false statements we are looking for, but we need 5 false to meet this, which does not align with our initial analysis).\n\nReevaluating for clarity and correctness:\n- **For Statement 6 to be true**, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- **For Statement 7 to be true**, the number of false statements must be a composite number (4, 6).\n\nGiven these constraints and correcting the oversight:\n- Having 3 true statements (prime) and 4 false statements (composite) satisfies both Statement 6 and Statement 7. This scenario also aligns with the possibility that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 could be true, given their conditions, but specifically, it aligns with the condition that exactly 3 statements are false (Statement 4), and by extension, exactly 4 statements are true does not fit this specific solution but having 3 true does.\n\nUpon careful consideration, the constraints provided by all statements, especially the prime and composite conditions, limit the solutions significantly. However, the initial analysis overlooked the direct implications of these constraints on the possible number of true and false statements.\n\nGiven the conditions and the need for the number of true statements to be prime and the number of false statements to be composite, and considering the constraints imposed by all statements:\n\nThe final number of possible solutions, considering all constraints and correcting for the oversight in analysis, especially focusing on the prime and composite requirements, is more nuanced. The conditions provided, especially by Statements 6 and 7, along with the implications of Statements 3, 4, and 5, suggest a specific scenario where the number of true statements is prime and the number of false statements is composite. \n\nHowever, the analysis provided did not correctly conclude the exact number of solutions based on these conditions.

This means we have to consider the possibility of 1 or more statements being true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says that at most 5 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that 2 or more statements must be true since if 5 are false, 2 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 4 of the 7 statements are true. This gives us a specific scenario to consider.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 states that exactly 3 of the 7 statements are false, which means 4 are true. This statement seems to align with Statement 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, Statements 3 and 4 essentially say the same thing (4 true statements), so they cannot be mutually exclusive in truth value regarding the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible numbers of true statements that are prime from 1 to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are those that have more than two factors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6, since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Combine the Information\nConsidering all statements, Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true in the context of Statement 5, but they essentially convey the same outcome (4 true statements). Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime, and Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite. Statement 3 (or 4) aligns with having 4 true statements, which is not a prime outcome based on Statement 6's requirement for the number of true statements to be prime.\n\n## Step 9: Determine Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints, especially from Statements 6 and 7, and considering Statement 5's implication that only one of Statement 3 or 4 can be true (though they convey the same numerical outcome), we must look for scenarios where the number of true statements is prime and the number of false statements is composite. The only scenario fitting all given constraints, especially considering the prime and composite requirements and the fact that Statements 3 and 4 essentially say the same thing, is having 4 true statements, which does not align with Statement 6's prime requirement but does fit with Statement 7's composite requirement for false statements (3 false statements are not composite, but 4 false statements would be if we were considering a different total number of statements).\n\n## Step 10: Reconcile the Statements\nUpon closer inspection, the statements create a paradox when trying to satisfy all conditions simultaneously due to their conflicting requirements. However, the key is in the logical consistency and the specific conditions given. Statement 5 creates a problem since Statements 3 and 4 are essentially the same in outcome. Given the conditions, especially the prime and composite requirements, we need to identify a scenario that fits all given constraints logically.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

If this is true, then 3 statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 says that exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false. This means that 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This creates an interesting dynamic because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true at the same time without contradicting Statement 5.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible numbers of true statements that are prime from 1 to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are numbers with more than two factors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6, since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating the Possibility of Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true, and 3 are false. This would make Statement 4 false. Given that 4 is a composite number, it fits Statement 7's condition (since 3 false statements would mean 4 true statements, and 4 is composite). However, we must check if this scenario aligns with all other statements.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating the Possibility of Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, and 4 are true. This scenario directly contradicts Statement 3, aligning with Statement 5's condition that only one of them can be true. With 3 false statements, the number of false statements is not composite (since 3 is prime), which would make Statement 7 false.\n\n## Step 10: Checking for Consistency Across All Statements\nGiven the constraints, we need a scenario where all true statements do not contradict each other, and all false statements do not create a paradox.\n\n- If Statement 3 is true (4 true, 3 false), it fits with Statement 7 (since 4 is composite), but we need to ensure it doesn't contradict other statements.\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because at most 5 statements are false (in this case, 3 are false).\n- Statement 5 is satisfied if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime. With 4 true statements, this condition is not met because 4 is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 11: Considering Alternative Scenarios\nGiven the constraints and the need for consistency, let's consider if Statement 4 could be true (3 false, 4 true). This would mean Statement 3 is false, aligning with Statement 5. However, with 4 true statements, Statement 6 is not satisfied because 4 is not prime.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluating the Prime Condition of Statement 6\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7). We need to find a scenario that satisfies this and does not contradict other statements.\n\n## Step 13: Checking for a Scenario Where 3 Statements Are True\nIf 3 statements are true, this satisfies Statement 6 (since 3 is prime). It also means 4 statements are false, which satisfies Statement 7 (since 4 is composite). Statement 1 and Statement 2 are also satisfied under this condition.\n\n## Step 14: Finalizing the Scenario\nWith 3 true statements and 4 false, we satisfy Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7. Statement 5 can be satisfied by having either Statement 3 or Statement 4 false, which is the case here since we've established a scenario where neither's exact condition is met but fits the broader constraints.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Statement 1 and Statement 4 can both be true, suggesting 6 true statements. However, this setup creates tension with Statement 6 (which requires a prime number of true statements, potentially satisfied if all are true) and Statement 7 (which requires a composite number of false statements, not satisfied if only 1 is false).

Given Statement 4's condition (6 true statements), this does not align because 6 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. With 1 false statement (as per Statement 4), this does not align because 1 is not considered composite.\n\n## Step 9: Determine Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 and Statement 4 can both be true, suggesting 6 true statements.\n- Statement 5 allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but given Statement 1's requirement, only Statement 4 can be true.\n- However, Statement 6 and Statement 7 impose additional constraints that must be considered in the context of all statements.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 with Other Statements\nGiven that Statement 4 (exactly 1 false statement) seems to align with the possibility of satisfying multiple conditions (including Statement 1), but contradicts Statement 6 (since 6 is not a prime number), we must carefully evaluate the truthfulness of all statements together.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the Implications of Each Statement Being True or False\n- If Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), it contradicts Statement 6 because 6 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 3 (exactly 3 true statements) cannot be true because it contradicts Statement 1.\n- Given the constraints, the only way for most statements to be true and satisfy the conditions is for Statement 4 to be true, but this creates a conflict with Statement 6.\n\n## Step 12: Final Evaluation\nUpon closer inspection, the conflict arises from trying to satisfy all statements simultaneously. Statement 1 requires at least 6 true statements, which aligns with Statement 4. However, Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime, which contradicts the scenario where 6 statements are true. This indicates a mistake in assuming that all statements can be satisfied under the initial analysis.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

However, since Statements 3 and 4 essentially state the same condition (5 true and 2 false), this means Statement 5 is actually affirming that the condition of having exactly 5 true statements (and thus 2 false statements) is true, but it introduces a paradox because it suggests a choice between two statements that are logically equivalent.\n\n6. **Statement 6** says the number of true statements is a prime number.

It also means 2 statements are false, which does not satisfy Statement 7 directly because 2 is not a composite number. However, Statement 4 being true (which is the same condition as Statement 3) does not change the outcome regarding prime and composite conditions.\n\n- For Statement 7 to be true (the number of false statements is a composite number), we need either 4 or 6 false statements, given the definitions. However, if we have 6 false statements, only 1 statement is true, which does not satisfy Statement 1 or Statement 6. If we have 4 false statements, then 3 statements are true, which satisfies Statement 1 but does not satisfy Statement 6 because 3 is not considered a prime outcome that satisfies all other conditions simultaneously.\n\nGiven these constraints, the only scenario that could potentially satisfy all statements (considering the truthfulness of at least some of them) is having exactly 5 true statements and 2 false statements, as this satisfies Statements 1, 3, 4, and 6. However, this scenario does not satisfy Statement 7 because 2 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number.\n\nThus, the only potential solution that fits most conditions (but not all, due to the nature of Statement 7 and the conditions around prime and composite numbers) involves 5 true statements.

However, if we consider the possibility of 5 true statements (which contradicts our initial analysis based on Statements 1 and 2), then 2 statements are false, which also does not fit as 2 is a prime number.\n\n## Step 8: Combining the Analyses\nGiven the constraints and analyses, the only feasible scenario that does not immediately result in a contradiction is where exactly 6 statements are true, as per Statement 3. This means Statement 4 must be false. Statement 5 can be true because it allows for either Statement 3 or 4 to be true, but not both. Statement 6 cannot be true under this scenario because 6 is not a prime number, indicating a potential misunderstanding in the initial analysis regarding prime numbers and the conditions set by the statements. Statement 7's condition for the number of false statements to be composite is not met if only 1 statement is false, as 1 is neither prime nor composite in this context, but this is a point of contention based on the definition of composite numbers starting from 4.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluating for Consistency\nUpon re-evaluation, considering Statement 3's claim that exactly 6 statements are true, this would mean that Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which aligns with our finding. Statement 6's claim about the number of true statements being prime is problematic since 6 is not prime, suggesting an error in considering it as a viable condition under the initial premise. Statement 7's condition for the number of false statements to be composite is not directly relevant if we accept that exactly 6 statements are true, making 1 false statement, which does not fit the composite condition but was a point of analysis rather than a condition to fulfill.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the analysis, the scenario where exactly 6 statements are true seems plausible at first glance, especially considering Statements 1, 2, and 3. However, upon closer inspection, the conditions imposed by all statements, especially regarding prime and composite numbers, introduce complexities. The critical insight is recognizing which statements can coexist as true without violating logical consistency, particularly focusing on the claims about the number of true and false statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyzing Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that at least 6 of the 7 statements are true. This means that the minimum number of true statements is 6, and the maximum is 7, since all statements cannot be true given the nature of the statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 says that at most 1 of the 7 statements is false. This implies that the minimum number of true statements is 6, which aligns with Statement 1.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 asserts that exactly 6 of the 7 statements are true. This directly implies that one statement is false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 5 of the 7 statements are false. This means that 2 statements are true, which contradicts the implications of Statements 1, 2, and 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the analysis, Statement 3 seems plausible because it aligns with the minimum requirement of true statements from Statements 1 and 2, while Statement 4 does not.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Since 6 is not a prime number, but 7 is, this statement could potentially be true if all statements were true, which would be a contradiction given the nature of the statements.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. Given that 1 is not considered composite and is the only non-composite number aside from prime numbers, if there's only 1 false statement, this statement could be true because 1 false statement would indeed make the number of false statements not composite, potentially creating a contradiction depending on the other statements' truth values.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements, the key is in Statements 3 and 5. If Statement 3 is true (exactly 6 statements are true), then Statement 4 must be false (as per Statement 5), which aligns with our initial analysis that at least 6 statements must be true. Statement 6 cannot be true if exactly 6 statements are true because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7, however, could be true if there is exactly 1 false statement, as 1 is not composite, but this depends on the definition of composite numbers starting from 2 or more. Given these constraints, we need to find a scenario where all conditions are met without contradiction.\n\n## Step 9: Identifying the Solution\nGiven the constraints, especially from Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5, the most plausible scenario is that exactly 6 statements are true, which means Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 must then be false. Statement 1 and 2 are also true under this condition. Statement 6 cannot be true because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7's truth value depends on the definition of composite numbers, but given 1 false statement, it could potentially be seen as not fulfilling the \"composite\" criteria due to the number of false statements being 1, which is not composite. This leaves us with a potential contradiction in interpreting Statement 7, but given the strict definitions, if we consider 1 as not composite, then Statement 7 could be false, which fits our scenario of exactly 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nConsidering all steps, the only scenario that fits without contradiction, given the statements' constraints, is that exactly 6 statements are true. This makes Statement 3 true and, by extension, makes Statement 4 false. Statements 1 and 2 are also true. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7's status can depend on interpretation, but if we strictly follow the logic that 1 false statement does not fulfill the \"composite\" criteria due to being a unit and not a composite number, then it could be considered false, fitting our model of exactly 6 true statements. This leaves us with a fixed number of possible solutions based on the truthfulness of these statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Given Statement 1's requirement for at least 4 true statements and the prime requirement from Statement 6, having exactly 5 true statements seems plausible as it satisfies both Statement 1 and Statement 6.

This, combined with the constraints from Statements 6 and 7, helps to narrow down the possibilities.\n\n## Step 14: Assess the prime and composite conditions.\nThe prime condition from Statement 6 and the composite condition from Statement 7 further restrict the possible combinations of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 15: Conclude on the number of possible solutions.\nConsidering all constraints and the fact that some statements cannot be true at the same time (especially with Statement 2's all-true requirement conflicting with other statements' specifics), we must find a combination that satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means the number of true statements can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 says that at most 0 of the statements are false, which implies all statements must be true for this to hold. However, this seems to directly conflict with the possibility of having any false statements, making it a critical point for analysis.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 states that exactly 4 of the statements are true. This gives a specific number of true statements, which can help in narrowing down the possibilities.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 3 of the statements are false, which means exactly 4 statements are true. This statement seems to align with Statement 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, Statements 3 and 4 essentially say the same thing (4 true statements), so they cannot be mutually exclusive in truth value regarding the outcome they describe.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the number of true statements could be any of these for Statement 6 to be true.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that for Statement 7 to be true, there must be either 4 or 6 false statements, meaning 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Compatibility and Restrictions\n- Statement 2 cannot be true because if all statements were true, Statement 5 would be false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true together according to Statement 5), leading to a contradiction.\n- Statements 3 and 4 essentially convey the same information (exactly 4 true statements), which aligns with the condition of Statement 5 but contradicts its \"but not both\" clause since they describe the same outcome.\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. Given Statement 3 and Statement 4's alignment on 4 true statements, this does not fit Statement 6 unless exactly 3 or 5 statements are true, considering prime numbers.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite (4 or 6), which means 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Finding a Consistent Solution\nGiven the constraints, let's evaluate possible scenarios:\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), this does not satisfy Statement 6 directly since 4 is not a prime number. However, it does satisfy the condition of having a composite number of false statements (3 true statements would mean 4 false statements, which is composite).\n- Statement 5 poses a problem because it suggests only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, yet they convey the same truth condition (4 true statements).\n\n## Step 10: Resolving the Paradox\nConsidering all statements, the key is finding a set of statements that can be true without contradicting each other. Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true according to Statement 5, but they essentially state the same condition. Statement 2 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with Statement 5. The truthfulness of Statement 1 is dependent on the actual number of true statements.\n\n## Step 11: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the necessity for consistency:\n- If 4 statements are true, Statements 3 and 4 are essentially true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- Statement 6 requires a prime number of true statements, which could be 3 or 5 given the context.\n- Statement 7 requires a composite number of false statements, which could be achieved with 3 true statements (4 false, which is composite).\n\n## Step 12: Conclusion\nConsidering all constraints and the requirement for logical consistency without direct contradiction, we must find a scenario where the statements can coexist truthfully. Given the analysis, the possibility of having exactly 3 true statements seems plausible as it satisfies Statement 1 (at least 3 true), makes Statement 6 potentially true (3 is a prime number), and aligns with Statement 7 (4 false statements, which is composite). However, this step requires acknowledging the limitations and potential contradictions posed by the other statements, particularly the conflict between Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

However, this seems immediately contradictory with the nature of self-referential paradoxes and the content of other statements.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 states that exactly 4 of the statements are true. This gives a specific condition that can be tested against other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 says exactly 3 of the statements are false, which means exactly 4 are true. This statement is equivalent to Statement 3 in terms of the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, since Statements 3 and 4 are logically equivalent (both stating that exactly 4 statements are true), they cannot be true exclusively of each other.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Relevant prime numbers in this context could be 2, 3, 5, or 7, given the total number of statements.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. Given 7 statements, the possible numbers of false statements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, and composite numbers among these are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Consistency Across Statements\n- Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true according to Statement 5, but they essentially say the same thing, creating a paradox.\n- Statement 2 cannot be true because if all statements were true, Statement 5 would be false (since 3 and 4 cannot both be true), creating a contradiction.\n- Statement 1 is a condition that can be met under various scenarios, including the truth of Statements 3 or 4.\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. If exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), this does not satisfy Statement 6 because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 can be true if the number of false statements is 4 or 6, which aligns with having 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 9: Finding Consistent Solutions\nGiven the constraints and analyzing the statements together:\n- If Statements 3 and 4 are true, then exactly 4 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 6 (since 4 is not prime) and makes Statement 5 false (since 3 and 4 cannot both be true exclusively).\n- The only prime number of true statements that satisfies all conditions without immediate contradiction is 3 (from Statement 6), but this must be evaluated against all other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluating the Prime Condition\nIf 3 statements are true (to satisfy the prime condition of Statement 6), and considering Statement 1 (at least 3 true), Statement 7 (composite number of false statements), and the impossibility of Statement 2 being true, we look for combinations that satisfy these conditions without contradicting each other.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for Composite False Statements\nWith 3 true statements, 4 would be false, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n\n## Step 12: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements and their implications, the solution must satisfy the prime number of true statements, the composite number of false statements, and not contradict the \"at least 3 true\" condition while also considering the constraints imposed by the other statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

However, Statement 7 is not directly satisfied because 2 false statements are not composite in the context of this problem's constraints.\n- Statement 4 cannot be true because it contradicts all other statements by implying only 1 true statement.\n- The only scenario that seems plausible under multiple constraints is having exactly 5 true statements, which would make Statement 3 true. This scenario does not perfectly align with all statements due to the complexity and contradictions within the set.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nConsidering the constraints and the need for consistency across statements, the most likely scenario that fits the majority of the conditions without direct contradiction is having exactly 5 true statements. However, the question asks for the number of possible solutions, not the solutions themselves.

Statement 5 supports the exclusivity of Statement 3 or Statement 4, and since Statement 4 is not feasible, Statement 3's condition could potentially be met. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements is prime, and 5 is prime, supporting Statement 3's claim. However, we must consider the implications of all statements together for consistency.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Consistency Across Statements\n- If Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 5 is also true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, and we've established Statement 4 cannot be true.\n- With 5 true statements, Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. With 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements, which does not satisfy Statement 7 since 2 is not composite.\n- Given this inconsistency with Statement 7, we must reconsider the initial assumption that exactly 5 statements are true based on Statement 3.\n\n## Step 10: Reconsider Based on Inconsistencies\nGiven the inconsistency with Statement 7 when assuming Statement 3 is true, let's consider other possibilities:\n- If exactly 5 statements are true, it contradicts Statement 7 because 2 false statements are not composite.\n- Statement 4 cannot be true as it contradicts Statements 1 and 2.\n- The only prime number of true statements that also satisfies Statement 1 and does not directly contradict other statements (considering the possibility of reevaluation) is 5, but it has to align with all other conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Final Evaluation\nConsidering all statements, the conditions set by Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 can potentially align if exactly 5 statements are true, despite the initial inconsistency noted with Statement 7. This alignment would make Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 true. Statement 4 is false as it contradicts the conditions. The inconsistency with Statement 7 suggests a deeper examination is needed for a fully consistent solution across all statements.\n\n## Step 12: Resolve the Inconsistency\nUpon further reflection, the inconsistency with Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) when having 5 true statements (2 false statements) indicates a mistake in assuming this scenario satisfies all conditions. Given the constraints and the need for a solution that fits all statements without contradiction, we must find a scenario where all true statements align without contradicting any other statement.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
