Let's correct the count based on the actual conversion of 1962033342 to binary and counting the '1's correctly.\n\nThe correct binary representation for 1962033342 is 11101000111011100110010110110.\n\nLet's recount the '1's in 11101000111011100110010110110:\n1. The first '1' \n2. The second '1' \n3. The third '1' \n4. The '1' after the first '0'\n5. The first '1' in the second set of '1's\n6. The second '1' in the second set of '1's\n7. The third '1' in the second set of '1's\n8. The '1' after the second '0'\n9. The first '1' in the third set of '1's\n10. The second '1' in the third set of '1's\n11. The '1' after the third '0'\n12. The '1' after the fourth '0'\n13. The '1' after the fifth '0'\n14. The '1' after the sixth '0'\n15. The '1' at the very end.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of '1' bits in the binary representation of the number 1962033342 is 12 + 3 (from the last part which I missed) = 15, but considering the detailed breakdown provided above, let's ensure the count is accurate based on the binary representation provided.\n\n\n<answer>12</answer>",

Instead, we recognize that the number of 1 bits in a binary representation can be found by using bitwise operations or by converting the number to binary and then counting the '1's.\n\n## Step 4: Utilize a programming approach\nIn practice, we can use a programming language to convert the number to binary and count the 1 bits. For example, in Python, we can use the built-in functions bin() to convert to binary and then count the '1's.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the approach\nUsing Python: `bin(1716087199)[2:]` gives us the binary representation as a string (excluding the '0b' prefix), and then we count the '1's in this string.\n\n## Step 6: Count the 1 bits\nThe binary representation of 1716087199 is 11001100111010110100111110111111.
