Start with July 2, 2022, and subtract 76 days.\n\nJuly has 31 days, so from July 2, we subtract the remaining days in July (31 - 2 = 29 days), which brings us to August 31 as a reference point for counting the rest of the days. \n\nHowever, we need to count back 76 days, which means we go back through all of August (since 31 days in August would be part of the 76 days), all of July (except the first 2 days), and then into June.\n\n2. Calculate the days:\n- August has 31 days.\n- July has 31 days, but we only count back to July 2, so we consider 29 days in July.\n- The total days in August and the rest of July (after July 2) are 31 (August) + 29 (July after the 2nd) = 60 days.\n\nThis leaves us with 76 - 60 = 16 days to account for in June.\n\n3.

February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year for simplicity). Starting from February 1st, which would be a Thursday (the day after January 31st), February 28th would be a Tuesday (since 28 days include four full weeks, which brings us back to a Tuesday, considering we started counting from a Thursday).\n\n3. March has 31 days. March 1st would be a Wednesday (the day after February 28th's Tuesday). March 31st would then be a Friday (since 31 days include four full weeks and three additional days, which brings us from Wednesday to Friday).\n\n4. April starts on a Saturday (the day after March 31st's Friday). Therefore, April 3rd would be a Tuesday (since April 1st is a Saturday, April 2nd is a Sunday, and April 3rd is a Monday, but given the sequence, it actually falls on a Tuesday if we count correctly from Saturday as the first day of April: Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and then Tuesday).\n\nHowever, the correct counting from January 1st being a Monday should actually align as follows when accurately tallying the days month by month:\n- January 1st to January 31st correctly ends on a Wednesday.\n- February 1st to February 28th ends on a Tuesday.\n- March 1st to March 31st ends on a Friday.\n- April 1st, being the day after Friday, March 31st, is a Saturday.\n- Counting forward: April 1st is a Saturday, April 2nd is a Sunday, and April 3rd is a Monday.\n\nGiven the mistake in the step-by-step process above regarding the final determination, let's correct that based on the proper counting method without the error:\nIf January 1st is a Monday, then:\n- The last day of January (31st) is a Wednesday.\n- The last day of February (28th, assuming not a leap year) is a Tuesday.\n- The last day of March (31st) is a Friday.\n- April 1st is a Saturday, April 2nd is a Sunday, and therefore, April 3rd is a Monday.\n\nSo, the correct weekday for April 3rd, given January 1st is a Monday, is actually Monday.\n\n<answer>Monday</answer>",

With 12 full weeks (84 days), that gives us 12 * 5 = 60 business days.\n- The remaining 5 days (89 total days - 84 days in full weeks) would include a Saturday and Sunday, and since our end date is a Wednesday, these extra days are Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, which are all business days.\n\nThus, the correct calculation directly considers the total span and accurately identifies business days within it, reflecting on the inclusion of both the start and end dates in the count.\n\n<answer>63</answer>",

These days are part of the first partial week and have been included in the overall count of weeks but let's clarify:\n\n- August 29 to September 2 is the first full week, which we counted correctly as part of the 12 full weeks.\n\nSo, revisiting the initial calculation for accuracy:\n- We correctly identified 12 full weeks from August 29 to November 18, which gives us 60 business days.\n- We then added 3 business days for November 21 to November 23.\n\nHowever, the correct approach to count business days should directly consider all Mondays to Fridays between the given dates without splitting into full and partial weeks unnecessarily:\n\n- From August 29 (first Monday) to November 18 (last Friday before November 23), we indeed have 12 full weeks, contributing 60 business days.\n- Then, for the remaining days (November 19 to November 23), Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are business days, adding 3 more business days.\n\nThus, the correct count should directly sum the business days without overcomplicating the weeks:\n- The period from August 27 to November 23 includes 13 weeks. If we count each week's business days (Monday to Friday), we get:\n  - August 27 to September 2: 5 business days (since August 29 to September 2 are business days).\n  - September 5 to November 18: 11 weeks * 5 business days/week = 55 business days.\n  - November 21 to November 23: 3 business days.\n\nSo, the correct total is 5 (from the first week) + 55 (from the following 11 full weeks) + 3 (from the last partial week) = 63 business days.\n\n<answer>63</answer>",

Since May 26 is a Thursday, there are 5 business days in May (May 26, May 27, May 31).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of days in June 2022\nJune has 30 days, and since June 1 is a Wednesday and June 30 is a Thursday, we can calculate the business days as follows: June has 22 business days (since 30 days - 8 weekend days = 22 business days).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of days in July 2022\nJuly has 31 days, with July 1 being a Friday and July 31 being a Sunday. This means July has 22 business days (31 days - 9 weekend days = 22 business days).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of days in August 2022\nAugust has 31 days, with August 1 being a Monday and August 31 being a Wednesday. This means August has 23 business days (31 days - 8 weekend days = 23 business days, but since August 31 is a Wednesday and not a Friday, we still count the full 23 days as they are all within the month).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of days in September 2022 up to September 2\nFor September, we are only interested in the days up to and including Friday, September 2. This gives us 2 business days in September (September 1 is a Thursday and September 2 is a Friday).\n\n## Step 6: Add up all the business days from each month\nNow, add up the business days from May (5 days), June (22 days), July (22 days), August (23 days), and the first two days of September (2 days).\n\n## Step 7: Sum the business days\nTotal business days = 5 (May) + 22 (June) + 22 (July) + 23 (August) + 2 (September) = 74.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{74}$",
