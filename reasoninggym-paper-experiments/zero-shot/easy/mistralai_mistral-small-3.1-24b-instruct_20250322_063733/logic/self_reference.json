However, this contradicts Statement 2, which says at most 3 statements are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - Since Statement 3 is false (from step 3), Statement 4 must be true for Statement 5 to be true. However, if Statement 4 is true, it contradicts Statement 2.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - We need to check if the number of true statements can be a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - We need to check if the number of false statements can be a composite number.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Statement 1 is true.\n  - This means there are at least 4 true statements.\n  - Statement 2 must also be true because it implies at least 4 true statements.\n  - Statement 3 is false (from step 3).\n  - Statement 4 is false (from step 4).\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 and Statement 7 need to be checked for consistency.\n\nIf Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true, we have at least 4 true statements. Let's check the remaining statements:\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Statement 6 is true.\n  - The number of true statements must be a prime number.\n  - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n  - Since we already have 2 true statements (Statement 1 and Statement 2), we need 2 more true statements to make it 4, which is not a prime number.\n  - If we have 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 must be false because the number of false statements would be 2, which is not a composite number.\n  - If we have 7 true statements, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 must be false because the number of false statements would be 0, which is not a composite number.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: Assume Statement 7 is true.\n  - The number of false statements must be a composite number.\n  - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, etc.\n  - If we have 4 true statements, Statement 7 is false because the number of false statements would be 3, which is not a composite number.\n  - If we have 5 true statements, Statement 7 is true because the number of false statements would be 2, which is not a composite number.\n  - If we have 7 true statements, Statement 7 is false because the number of false statements would be 0, which is not a composite number.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is having 5 true statements and 2 false statements. However, this contradicts Statement 2, which says at most 3 statements are false.\n\nTherefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the statements.\n\n<answer>0</answer>",

If this statement is true, then all other statements must also be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means that at least 5 statements are true.

However, this contradicts Statement 5, which requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be false. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Statement 2 is true.\n  - If Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true. This means there can be at most 2 false statements. Let's check the consistency with other statements:\n    - Statement 3 cannot be true because it requires exactly 4 true statements.\n    - Statement 4 cannot be true because it requires exactly 2 true statements.\n    - Statement 5 must be true because it requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be false.\n    - Statement 6 must be true because the number of true statements (5) is a prime number.\n    - Statement 7 must be true because the number of false statements (2) is not a composite number, but this does not affect the consistency.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: Assume Statement 3 is true.\n  - If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true and 3 are false. This contradicts Statement 2, which allows at most 2 false statements. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n- **Scenario 4**: Assume Statement 4 is true.\n  - If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true and 5 are false. This contradicts Statement 2, which allows at most 2 false statements. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n- **Scenario 5**: Assume Statement 5 is true.\n  - If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This is consistent with the previous analysis.\n\n- **Scenario 6**: Assume Statement 6 is true.\n  - If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number. This is consistent with the previous analysis.\n\n- **Scenario 7**: Assume Statement 7 is true.\n  - If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number. This is consistent with the previous analysis.\n\nGiven the analysis, the only consistent scenario is when Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true, and Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4 are false. This results in exactly 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This would make Statement 4 false, which is consistent with Statement 5.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements. This would make Statement 3 false, which is also consistent with Statement 5.\n\nHowever, we need to check the consistency with Statements 6 and 7:\n- If there are 4 true statements, then there are 3 false statements. This satisfies Statement 2.\n- Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 would be false.\n- Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 would be false.\n\nThus, if Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, we have 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which satisfies Statements 1, 2, and 5, but not Statements 6 and 7.\n\nNow, let's consider other possibilities:\n- If there are 2 true statements, then there are 5 false statements. This does not satisfy Statement 1 or Statement 2.\n- If there are 3 true statements, then there are 4 false statements. This does not satisfy Statement 6 (since 3 is a prime number but 4 is a composite number).\n- If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements. This does not satisfy Statement 2 or Statement 7 (since 2 is not a composite number).\n- If there are 6 true statements, then there is 1 false statement. This does not satisfy Statement 2 or Statement 6 (since 6 is not a prime number).\n- If there are 7 true statements, then there are 0 false statements. This does not satisfy Statement 2 or Statement 7 (since 0 is not a composite number).\n\nGiven the analysis, the only consistent scenario is having 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which satisfies Statements 1, 2, and 5, but not Statements 6 and 7. However, since Statements 6 and 7 must be false in this scenario, it is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Therefore, Statement 2 must be false.\n\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n  - If this statement is true, then exactly 2 statements are true.

This would mean 3 statements are true, which does not contradict any other statements so far.\n\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n  - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true for Statement 5 to be true.\n\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n  - If Statement 4 is true, then there are 3 true statements. 3 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n  - If Statement 4 is true, then there are 4 false statements. 4 is a composite number, so Statement 7 is true.\n\nGiven that Statement 4 is true, and Statements 5, 6, and 7 are also true, we have exactly 4 false statements and 3 true statements. This scenario is consistent with all the statements.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
