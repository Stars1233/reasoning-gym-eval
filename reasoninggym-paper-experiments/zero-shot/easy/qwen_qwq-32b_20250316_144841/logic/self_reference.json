Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Statement 2** is always true because \"at most 7 of these 7 statements are false\" is inherently true.\n2. **Statement 5** requires that exactly one of Statements 3 or 4 is true. However, Statements 3 and 4 both imply that the number of true statements is 4 (since Statement 3 says exactly 4 are true and Statement 4 says exactly 3 are false, which also means 4 are true). Thus, both Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true simultaneously.\n3. **Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be composite (4 or 6), leading to possible true statement counts of 3 or 1. However, **Statement 6** requires the number of true statements to be prime. This narrows down the possible true statement counts to 3 (since 1 is not prime).\n4. **Checking possible values for T (number of true statements):**\n   - **T = 2**: \n     - True statements: 2 (Statement 2) and 6 (prime check). \n     - False statements: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7. \n     - Valid as all conditions are met.\n   - **T = 3**: \n     - True statements: 2 (Statement 2), 6 (prime check), and 7 (composite check for false statements). \n     - False statements: 1, 3",
