The problem asks to find the smallest integer `m` such that the proportion of perfect partitions to total partitions is less than `max_proportion`. The example shows that for `max_proportion` such that the function returns `{'smallest_m': 2652}`, the value 2652 is the smallest integer `m` satisfying the condition.\n\nWe need to find a `max_proportion` that leads to `smallest_m = 2652`. The code iterates through integers and checks if `(integer**2 - 1) / 4` is an integer. If it is, it's considered a partition. Then, it checks if the partition is \"perfect\" using the `check_partition_perfect` function. The proportion is calculated as `perfect_partitions / total_partitions`. The loop continues until this proportion falls below `max_proportion`.\n\nSince we know the expected output is 2652, we can try to estimate a `max_proportion` value.  The code stops when the proportion becomes *less than* `max_proportion`.  If `m` is 2652, then `(m**2 - 1) / 4` must be an integer, which is `(2652**2 - 1) / 4 = 1758000 - 1 / 4 = 1757999 / 4 = 439499.75`. This is incorrect. Let's try `m = 2653`. `(2653**2 - 1) / 4 = (6999999 - 1) / 4 = 6999998 / 4 = 1749999.5`. This is also incorrect.\n\nThe partition candidate is actually `(integer**2 - 1) / 4`, so let's consider the case when `integer = 2653`. Then the partition candidate is `(2653**2 - 1) / 4 = (6999999 - 1) / 4 = 1749999.5`, which is not an integer.\nThe next integer is 2654. Then the partition candidate is `(2654**2 - 1) / 4 = (7039196 - 1) / 4 = 7039195 / 4 = 1759798.75`.\nThe next integer is 2655. Then the partition candidate is `(2655**2 - 1) / 4 = (7049025 - 1) / 4 = 7049024 / 4 = 1762256`.\nSo the first integer that gives an integer partition candidate is 2655.\n\nWe are looking for a `max_proportion` such that the loop terminates when the partition candidate is 2652. This means that the proportion is slightly above `max_proportion` when the partition candidate is 2652, and it drops below `max_proportion` when the next valid candidate is reached.

Since the code iterates and checks proportions, a smaller `max_proportion` will require more iterations to find a value of `m` that satisfies the condition.

This means `log(n)` is approximately `e^2.327` which is about 10.17. Therefore, `n` is approximately `e^10.17` which is about 25800.  Let's try a value around 25800.\n\nIf `n` has 2 distinct prime factors, it could be of the form `p * q` where p and q are prime numbers. Let's try n = 2 * 3 * 4279 = 25674.\nLet's try n = 2 * 5 * 2579 = 25790.\nLet's try n = 2 * 7 * 1841 = 25788.\nLet's try n = 2 * 12839 = 25678.\n\nLet's try n = 10. The distinct prime factors are 2 and 5, so the count is 2. log(log(10)) = log(2.302) = 0.834. This doesn't match.\n\nLet's try n = 14. The distinct prime factors are 2 and 7, so the count is 2. log(log(14)) = log(2.639) = 0.976. This doesn't match.\n\nLet's try n = 30. The distinct prime factors are 2, 3 and 5, so the count is 3.\n\nLet's try n = 12. The distinct prime factors are 2 and 3, so the count is 2. log(log(12)) = log(2.484) = 0.906. This doesn't match.\n\nLet's consider n=36. The prime factors are 2 and 3, so the count is 2. log(log(36)) = log(3.583) = 1.276.\n\nLet's try n = 100. Prime factors are 2 and 5, count is 2. log(log(100)) = log(4.605) = 1.527.\n\nLet's try n = 22. The distinct prime factors are 2 and 11, so the count is 2. log(log(22)) = log(3.091) = 1.125.\n\nLet's try n = 34. The distinct prime factors are 2 and 17, so the count is 2. log(log(34)) = log(3.526) = 1.262.\n\nIf we want log(log(n)) to be around 2.327, log(n) must be around e^2.327 = 10.17. Then n must be around e^10.17 = 25800.\n\nLet's try n = 2 * 12901 = 25802. 12901 is prime. The distinct prime factors are 2 and 12901, so the count is 2. log(log(25802)) = log(10.17) = 2.327.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"n\": 25802\n}\n```",

We want `base**power` to be as large as possible, but still have a relatively high digit sum.  Numbers with many 9s will have a high digit sum.\n\nIf we consider `a = 99` and `b = 99`, then the largest number we'll calculate is `99**99`. This is a very large number. The digit sum of such a number is likely to be high.  Let's try to estimate if `99**99` can yield a digit sum of 367.  The number of digits in `99**99` is approximately `99 * log10(99)` which is roughly `99 * 2` which is around 198.  If all digits were 9, the sum would be `198 * 9 = 1782`.

The output suggests that the maximum sum of digits of `a^b` for `a < 100` and `b < 100` is 367. This implies there exists some `a` and `b` such that `a^b` is a large number with digits that sum up to 367.\n\nSince we are looking for a large digital sum, we should consider large values of `a` and `b`.  Also, a larger exponent `b` will generally lead to a larger number and thus potentially a larger digital sum. Let's consider `a = 99` and `b = 99`.  `99^99` is a very large number. The number of digits in `99^99` is approximately `99 * log10(99)` which is roughly `99 * 2` = 198 digits. If all digits were 9, the sum would be `198 * 9 = 1782`.  This is much larger than 367.\n\nWe need to find smaller values of `a` and `b` that still yield a large digital sum. Let's try to find a value of `a^b` which has many 9s.

If we assume the average digit is around 4.5, then the number of digits should be around 367 / 4.5 = 81.

We need to find an `n` such that the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below `n` is 9716928.\n\nWe can approximate this by considering the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 separately and then subtracting the sum of multiples of 15 (to avoid double-counting).

The number of digits in `99^99` is approximately `99 * log10(99)` which is around `99 * 1.9956 = 197.56`. So, the number has 198 digits. If each digit were 9, the sum would be `198 * 9 = 1782`. This is much larger than 623. So we need to reduce either `a` or `b`.\n\nLet's try `a = 9` and `b = 9`. Then `9^9 = 387420489`. The sum of digits is `3 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 8 + 9 = 45`.\n\nLet's try `a = 10` and `b = 10`. Then `10^10 = 10000000000`. The sum of digits is 1.\n\nLet's try `a = 90` and `b = 90`. Then `90^90` is a very large number.\n\nSince the given answer is 623, we need to find values of a and b such that the sum of digits is close to 623. Let's try a = 3 and b = 10. 3^10 = 59049. Sum of digits = 5+9+0+4+9 = 27.\n\nLet's try a = 99 and b = 3. 99^3 = 970299. Sum of digits = 9+7+0+2+9+9 = 36.\n\nLet's try a = 99 and b = 4. 99^4 = 96059601. Sum of digits = 9+6+0+5+9+6+0+1 = 36.\n\nLet's consider a = 8 and b = 8. 8^8 = 16777216. Sum of digits = 1+6+7+7+7+2+1+6 = 37.\n\nLet's try a = 5 and b = 5. 5^5 = 3125. Sum of digits = 3+1+2+5 = 11.\n\nThe given example output is 623. Let's try to find a and b that give this result. It seems like we need a large number. Let a = 99 and b = 5. 99^5 = 9509900499. Sum of digits = 9+5+0+9+9+0+0+4+9+9 = 54.\n\nLet's try a = 9 and b = 7. 9^7 = 4782969. Sum of digits = 4+7+8+2+9+6+9 = 45.\n\nLet's try a = 98 and b = 2. 98^2 = 9604. Sum of digits = 9+6+0+4 = 19.\n\nLet's try a = 99 and b = 2. 99^2 = 9801. Sum of digits = 9+8+0+1 = 18.\n\nLet's try a=9 and b=6. 9^6 = 531441. Sum of digits = 5+3+1+4+4+1 = 18.\n\nSince we are looking for a sum of 623, we can try to find an a and b that will lead to a number with many digits that are close to 9. We can try a = 99 and b = 6. 99^6 = 885842425889. Sum of digits = 8+8+5+8+4+2+4+2+5+8+8+9 = 71.\n\nLet's try a = 99 and b = 7. 99^7 = 9227446944000000. Sum of digits = 9+2+2+7+4+4+6+9+4+4 = 51.\n\nLet's try a = 98 and b = 3. 98^3 = 941192. Sum of digits = 9+4+1+1+9+2 = 26.\n\nLet's consider a = 99 and b = 3. 99^3 = 970299. Sum of digits = 36.\n\nLet's try a = 99 and b = 8. 99^8 = 922368460496000000. Sum of digits = 63.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"a\": 99,\n  \"b\": 99\n}\n```",

Let's consider a case where `a` is close to 100 and `b` is also large.\n\nIf `a = 99` and `b = 99`, `99^99` is a very large number. The sum of its digits will be significant.

Since `a` and `b` are less than 100, a good starting point is to consider large values for both `a` and `b`.
