Notice that each term can be expressed as the sum of the previous two terms plus a correction.\n\n-1 + (-4) = -5 != -8\n-4 + (-8) = -12 != -15\n-8 + (-15) = -23 != -26\n-15 + (-26) = -41 != -44\n-26 + (-44) = -70 != -73\n\nLet's try another approach. Consider the sum of the three preceding terms:\n-1 + (-4) + (-8) = -13 != -15\n-4 + (-8) + (-15) = -27 != -26\n-8 + (-15) + (-26) = -49 != -44\n-15 + (-26) + (-44) = -85 != -73\n\nLet's examine the pattern more closely:\n-1\n-4 = -1 - 3\n-8 = -4 - 4\n-15 = -8 - 7\n-26 = -15 - 11\n-44 = -26 - 18\n-73 = -44 - 29\n\nThe differences are -3, -4, -7, -11, -18, -29.\nLet's look at the differences of these differences:\n-4 - (-3) = -1\n-7 - (-4) = -3\n-11 - (-7) = -4\n-18 - (-11) = -7\n-29 - (-18) = -11\n\nThese differences are -1, -3, -4, -7, -11, which are the same as the initial differences except for the sign. Thus, the next difference should be -18.\nSo, the next difference in the original sequence should be -29 + (-18) = -47.\nThe next term in the sequence is -73 + (-47) = -120.\n\nAlternatively, we can observe that each term is approximately the sum of the previous three terms.\n-1 + (-4) + (-8) = -13, -15 = -13 - 2\n-4 + (-8) + (-15) = -27, -26 = -27 + 1\n-8 + (-15) + (-26) = -49, -44 = -49 + 5\n-15 + (-26) + (-44) = -85, -73 = -85 + 12\nThe differences between the actual term and the sum of the previous three terms are -2, 1, 5, 12.\nThe differences of these differences are 1 - (-2) = 3, 5 - 1 = 4, 12 - 5 = 7.\nThe differences of these differences are 4 - 3 = 1, 7 - 4 = 3.\nThe difference of these differences is 3 - 1 = 2.\nSo the next difference of the differences of the differences is 3 + 2 = 5.\nThe next difference of the differences is 7 + 5 = 12.\nThe next difference is 12 + 12 = 24.\nThe next term is -85 + 24 = -61.\n\nAnother pattern:\na(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) + a(n-3) - c(n)\n-15 = -8 + (-4) + (-1) - 2\n-26 = -15 + (-8) + (-4) + 1\n-44 = -26 + (-15) + (-8) + 5\n-73 = -44 + (-26) + (-15) + 12\nThe sequence -2, 1, 5, 12 has differences 3, 4, 7, which has differences 1, 3. The next difference is 5, so the next term in the sequence is 7 + 5 = 12. The next term is 12 + 12 = 24. The next term in the original sequence is -73 + (-44) + (-26) - 24 = -143 - 24 = -167.\n\nLet's consider the recurrence relation: $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$.\n$a_4 = -1 + (-4) + (-8) = -13 \\neq -15$\n$a_5 = -4 + (-8) + (-15) = -27 \\neq -26$\n$a_6 = -8 + (-15) + (-26) = -49 \\neq -44$\n$a_7 = -15 + (-26) + (-44) = -85 \\neq -73$\n\nThe differences are -3, -4, -7, -11, -18, -29. The next difference should be -29 + (-18) = -47.\nSo, the next term in the sequence is -73 + (-47) = -120.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-120}$",

It seems like it could be repeating 8, 1, 9. Let's assume the next second difference is 8.\nThen the next first difference would be 19 + 8 = 27.\nSo the next term in the sequence would be 47 + 27 = 74.\n\nLet's check if there is another possible pattern.\nConsider the sequence as a sum of previous terms.\n8 + 9 = 17 != 18\n9 + 18 = 27 != 28\n18 + 28 = 46 != 47\n\nAnother approach:\n8 = 8\n9 = 8 + 1\n18 = 9 + 9\n28 = 18 + 10\n47 = 28 + 19\nThe additions are 1, 9, 10, 19.\nDifferences between these additions are 8, 1, 9. This seems to be repeating.\nSo the next addition should be 19 + 8 = 27.\nThen the next term is 47 + 27 = 74.\n\n<answer>74</answer>",
