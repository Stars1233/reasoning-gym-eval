Then 21 + 3 = 24.  This uses 3 and 7.  We can then use 6 and 10 to get 6 * (10-8) = 12, which doesn't help.\n   *  10 + 7 = 17. Then 17 + 6 = 23, not quite 24.\n   *  10 * 6 = 60. Too high.\n   *  Let's try division: 10 / (6 - 3) * 7 = 10 / 3 * 7 = 70/3 which is not an integer.\n   *  (10 - 7) * 6 / 3 = 3 * 6 / 3 = 6, which is not 24.\n   *  (7 + 3) * 6 / 10 = 10 * 6 / 10 = 6.\n   *  (10 -

3 = 20.\n   *  (6 * 3) + 10 + 7 = 18 + 10 + 7 = 35\n   *  10 * 6 - 7 - 3 = 60 - 7 - 3 = 50\n   *  6 / 3 * 10 + 7 = 2 * 10 + 7 = 27\n   *  7 * (10 - 6) / 3 = 7 * 4 / 3 = 28/3\n   *  (10 - 7) * 3 * 6 = 3 * 3 * 6 = 54\n\n4. **Correct Solution:**\n   * 7 + 10 + 6 -
