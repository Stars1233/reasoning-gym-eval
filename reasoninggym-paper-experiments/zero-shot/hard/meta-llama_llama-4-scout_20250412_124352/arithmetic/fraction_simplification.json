          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator\nTo simplify the fraction $\\dfrac{20430}{52830}$, we first need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20430 and 52830. This will help us reduce the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n## 2: Calculate the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm or factorization\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Starting with the two numbers:\n- Divide 52830 by 20430: $52830 = 2 \\times 20430 + 1200$\n- Then, divide 20430 by 1200: $20430 = 17 \\times 1200 + 30$\n- Next, divide 1200 by 30: $1200 = 40 \\times 30 + 0$\n\n## 3: Determine the GCD\nThe last non-zero remainder is 30, which is the GCD of 20430 and 52830.\n\n## 4: Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD\nNow, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 30 to simplify the fraction:\n$\\dfrac{20430 \\div 30}{52830 \\div 30} = \\dfrac{681}{1761}$\n\n## 5: Check if further simplification is possible\nWe should check if 681 and 1761 have a common divisor other than 1. To do this, we can again use the Euclidean algorithm:\n- Divide 1761 by 681: $1761 = 2 \\times 681 + 399$\n- Then, divide 681 by 399: $681 = 1 \\times 399 + 282$\n- Next, divide 399 by 282: $399 = 1 \\times 282 + 117$\n- Continue, divide 282 by 117: $282 = 2 \\times 117 + 48$\n- Then, divide 117 by 48: $117 = 2 \\times 48 + 21$\n- Next, divide 48 by 21: $48 = 2 \\times 21 + 6$\n- Then, divide 21 by 6: $21 = 3 \\times 6 + 3$\n- Finally, divide 6 by 3: $6 = 2 \\times 3 + 0$\n\n## 6: Determine the new GCD and simplify further if necessary\nThe last non-zero remainder is 3, which means 681 and 1761 have a GCD of 3. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:\n$\\dfrac{681 \\div 3}{1761 \\div 3} = \\dfrac{227}{587}$\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>\\dfrac{227}{587}</answer>",
