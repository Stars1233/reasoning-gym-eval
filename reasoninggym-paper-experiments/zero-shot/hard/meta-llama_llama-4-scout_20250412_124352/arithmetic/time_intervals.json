The meeting started on 2837-06-30 and ended on 2837-07-17. The difference in days is 17 - 30 + 1 = -13 + 1 = -12 days, but since July has 31 days, we count the days correctly: from June 30 to June 30 is 0 days, so from June 30 to July 17 is 17 days. However, we must accurately account for the entire period.\n\n## 2: Accurate calculation of days\nThe accurate way to calculate is to consider the entire period: from June 30 to July 17. June has 30 days, so from June 30 to June 30 (next year is not considered here) is effectively 0 days for June. Then, July has 17 days from July 1 to July 17. So, the meeting spanned 17 days in July and the remaining days in June which is 0 since it started on June 30. But to be precise: June 30 to July 1 is 1 day, and then July 1 to July 17 is 16 days. So, in total, it is 1 (for July 1) + 16 (for the rest of July) = 17 days.\n\n## 3: Calculate hours, minutes, and seconds\nThe meeting started at 16:19 and ended at 20:09. The difference in hours is 20 - 16 = 4 hours. The difference in minutes is 09 - 19 = -10 minutes. To make it positive, we can add 60 minutes to -10 minutes which equals 50 minutes, but we have to subtract 1 hour from the 4 hours, resulting in 3 hours. So, the correct difference is 3 hours and 50 minutes.\n\n## 4: Combine days, hours, minutes, and seconds\nThe meeting lasted for 17 days, 3 hours, and 50 minutes. There are no additional seconds since both end and start times are :09 and :19, respectively, which results in a 50-minute difference.\n\n## 5: Format the answer\nThe meeting lasted for 17 days, 03:50:00.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>17 days, 03:50:00</answer>",

To convert the end time to UTC, we add 1 hour.\n\n## 2: Adjust end time to UTC\nEnd time in UTC = 2959-11-01 00:17:28 + 0100 = 2959-11-01 01:17:28 +0000.\n\n## 3: Calculate the duration\nNow, calculate the duration between 2959-10-25 20:12:02 +0000 and 2959-11-01 01:17:28 +0000.\n\n## 4: Break down the dates for easier calculation\n- Start date: 2959-10-25 20:12:02\n- End date: 2959-11-01 01:17:28\n\n## 5: Calculate days\nFrom 2959-10-25 to 2959-10-31 is 6 days.\nFrom 2959-10-31 to 2959-11-01 is 1 day.\nSo, in total, that's 7 days.\n\n## 6: Calculate the time difference within the last day\n- Start time on the last day: 20:12:02\n- End time on the last day: 01:17:28\n\n## 7: Convert times to seconds for easier calculation\nStart time in seconds = 20 * 3600 + 12 * 60 + 2 = 72000 + 720 + 2 = 72722 seconds.\nEnd time in seconds = 1 * 3600 + 17 * 60 + 28 = 3600 + 1020 + 28 = 4648 seconds.\n\n## 8: Calculate the time difference in seconds\nSince the end time is on the next day, we calculate the difference as follows:\n- From 20:12:02 to 00:00:00 is  23 * 3600 + 47 * 60 + 58 = 82800 + 2820 + 58 = 85678 seconds.\n- From 00:00:00 to 01:17:28 is 1 * 3600 + 17 * 60 + 28 = 3600 + 1020 + 28 = 4648 seconds.\nSo, the total time difference within the days is 85678 + 4648 = 90326 seconds.\n\n## 9: Convert seconds to HH:MM\n90326 seconds = 25 * 3600 + 5 * 60 + 26 = 25 hours, 5 minutes, 26 seconds.\nConverting 25 hours to days and hours: 1 day and 1 hour.\nSo, 1 day, 1 hour, 5 minutes, 26 seconds. For the format D days, HH:MM, we consider 1 day (from the 1 hour, which is less than a full day) and 1:05.\n\n## 10: Combine days and time for final duration\nTotal duration = 6 full days (from step 5) + 1 day (from the time difference) = 7 days + 1 day = 8 days, but we only count full days for \"D days\" and then add the time.\nThe correct approach to calculate duration is:\n- 7 days (full days) \n- And then add 5 hours, 5 minutes.\n\n## 11: Final calculation\nThe operation started on 2959-10-25 and ended on 2959-11-01, which is 7 days apart.\nAdding the time: \n20:12:02 to 23:59:59 = 3 hours, 47 minutes, 57 seconds.\n00:00:00 to 01:17:28 = 1 hour, 17 minutes, 28 seconds.\nTotal time = 5 hours, 5 minutes, 25 seconds \u2248 5:05.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>7 days, 05:05</answer>",

Since we have a negative, we'll borrow 1 minute from the minutes difference, making it 4 minutes, and adding 60 seconds to -22, we get 38 seconds.\n- Milliseconds difference: 429 - 271 = 158 milliseconds\n\nSo, putting it all together: 0 hours, 4 minutes, 38 seconds, and 158 milliseconds.\n\nThe duration of the meeting is: 00:04:38.158\n\n<answer>00:04:38.158</answer>",

The end time is 2358-04-25 (Friday) 05:49:37 -0900. To convert to UTC, we add 9 hours.

To simplify calculations, let's convert these to UTC.\n\n## 2: Calculate the UTC time for the start date.\nThe start date in UTC can be calculated by adding 7 hours to 10 December 2700, 17:24.
