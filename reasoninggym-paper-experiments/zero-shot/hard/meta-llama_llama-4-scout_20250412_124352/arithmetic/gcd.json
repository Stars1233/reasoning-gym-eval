The algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division. We start with the larger number, 6244, and the smaller number, 1892.\n\n## 2: Apply the Euclidean algorithm for 6244 and 1892\nDivide 6244 by 1892: $6244 = 1892 \\times 3 + 568$. Next, divide 1892 by 568: $1892 = 568 \\times 3 + 92$. Then, divide 568 by 92: $568 = 92 \\times 6 + 16$. Continue with 92 divided by 16: $92 = 16 \\times 5 + 12$.

Find the prime factorization of each number\nTo find the GCD, it's helpful to start by finding the prime factorization of each number.\n\n## 3: Prime factorization of 5498\n5498 = 2 * 2749 = 2 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 (or \\(2 * 7^4\\)).\n\n## 4: Prime factorization of 9135\n9135 = 3 * 5 * 7 * 87 = 3 * 5 * 7 * 3 * 29 (or \\(3^2 * 5 * 7 * 29\\)).\n\n## 5: Prime factorization of 6696\n6696 = 2 * 3348 = 2 * 2 * 1674 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 837 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 279 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 93 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 31 (or \\(2^3 * 3^3 * 31\\)).\n\n## 6: Prime factorization of 8958\n8958 = 2 * 4479 = 2 * 3 * 1493 (and 1493 is a prime number) (or \\(2 * 3 * 1493\\)).\n\n## 7: Identify common prime factors across all numbers\nThe common prime factor among all numbers is not immediately clear from their factorizations. Let's correct the approach by directly finding GCD through a more efficient method since factorization became cumbersome.\n\n## 8: Use the Euclidean algorithm for GCD\nA more efficient approach is to use the Euclidean algorithm. First, find the GCD of two numbers and then find the GCD of the result with the next number.\n\n## 9: GCD of 5498 and 9135\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n- \\(9135 = 5498 * 1 + 3637\\)\n- \\(5498 = 3637 * 1 + 1861\\)\n- \\(3637 = 1861 * 1 + 1776\\)\n- \\(1861 = 1776 * 1 + 85\\)\n- \\(1776 = 85 * 20 + 76\\)\n- \\(85 = 76 * 1 + 9\\)\n- \\(76 = 9 * 8 + 4\\)\n- \\(9 = 4 * 2 + 1\\)\n- \\(4 = 1 * 4 + 0\\)\nSo, GCD(5498, 9135) = 1.\n\n## 10: Since GCD(5498, 9135) = 1, GCD with other numbers will also be 1\nGiven that the GCD of the first two numbers is 1, the GCD of 1 with any other number is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>1</answer>",

The GCD of a set of numbers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n## 2: Choose a Method\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers and then extend it to find the GCD of multiple numbers. The Euclidean algorithm involves repeatedly applying the division algorithm, swapping the remainder with the divisor, until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n## 3: Find GCD of 6196 and 5729\nFirst, let's find the GCD of 6196 and 5729 using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n## 4: Apply Euclidean Algorithm for 6196 and 5729\n- \\(6196 = 5729 \\times 1 + 467\\)\n- \\(5729 = 467 \\times 12 + 155\\)\n- \\(467 = 155 \\times 3 + 2\\)\n- \\(155 = 2 \\times 77 + 1\\)\n- \\(2 = 1 \\times 2 + 0\\)\n\nSo, the GCD of 6196 and 5729 is 1.\n\n## 5: Find GCD of Result with 6863\nNow, we find the GCD of 1 and 6863. Since 1 is a divisor of every integer, the GCD of 1 and 6863 is 1.\n\n## 6: Conclusion\nGiven that the GCD of 6196 and 5729 is 1, and the GCD of 1 and any number is 1, the GCD of 6196, 5729, and 6863 is 1.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Find the prime factorization or use the Euclidean algorithm for each pair of numbers\nTo find the GCD of three numbers, we can first find the GCD of two numbers and then find the GCD of the result with the third number. The Euclidean algorithm is efficient for this.\n\n## 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find GCD(3831, 7413)\nFirst, divide 7413 by 3831: $7413 = 3831 \\times 1 + 3582$.\n\n## 4: Continue the Euclidean algorithm for GCD(3831, 7413)\nNext, divide 3831 by 3582: $3831 = 3582 \\times 1 + 249$.\n\n## 5: Further continue the Euclidean algorithm for GCD(3831, 7413)\nThen, divide 3582 by 249: $3582 = 249 \\times 14 + 156$.\n\n## 6: Continue again for GCD(3831, 7413)\nNext, divide 249 by 156: $249 = 156 \\times 1 + 93$.\n\n## 7: Continue for GCD(3831, 7413)\nThen, divide 156 by 93: $156 = 93 \\times 1 + 63$.\n\n## 8: Continue for GCD(3831, 7413)\nNext, divide 93 by 63: $93 = 63 \\times 1 + 30$.\n\n## 9: Continue for GCD(3831, 7413)\nThen, divide 63 by 30: $63 = 30 \\times 2 + 3$.\n\n## 10: Final step for GCD(3831, 7413)\nNext, divide 30 by 3: $30 = 3 \\times 10 + 0$. So, GCD(3831, 7413) = 3.\n\n## 11: Find GCD(3, 2997)\nNow, divide 2997 by 3: $2997 = 3 \\times 999 + 0$. So, GCD(3, 2997) = 3.\n\n## 12: Conclusion\nSince GCD(3831, 7413) = 3 and GCD(3, 2997) = 3, the GCD of 3831, 7413, and 2997 is 3.\n\n<answer>3</answer>",
