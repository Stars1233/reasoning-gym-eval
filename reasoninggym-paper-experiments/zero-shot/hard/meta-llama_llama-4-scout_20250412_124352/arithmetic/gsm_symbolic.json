So, he has 8 - 2 = 6 pen pals left.\n\n## 2: Calculate the total number of letters Mike receives and sends per week.\nEach of the 6 pen pals sends 4 letters a week, and Mike responds in kind. So, he receives 6 * 4 = 24 letters and sends 24 letters per week.\n\n## 3: Calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week.\nEach letter is 6 pages long. Since Mike sends 24 letters per week, he writes 24 * 6 = 144 pages per week.\n\n## 4: Calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week in minutes.\nMike can write a page every 15 minutes. So, to write 144 pages, he spends 144 * 15 = 2160 minutes per week.\n\n## 5: Convert the total time Mike spends writing per week from minutes to hours.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 2160 minutes is equal to 2160 / 60 = 36 hours.\n\n<answer>36</answer>",

Given that 10% of the 80-item quiz are geometry questions, we find 10% of 80. This is calculated as $0.10 \\times 80 = 8$ geometry questions.\n\n## 2: Calculate the number of history and geography questions\nThe rest of the questions, which are not geometry, are equally divided between history and geography. Since there are 80 questions in total and 8 are geometry, $80 - 8 = 72$ questions are history and geography combined. These 72 questions are equally divided between history and geography, so there are $72 / 2 = 36$ questions for each of history and geography.\n\n## 3: Calculate the number of geometry questions Ava will get correct\nAva is sure to get 100% of the geometry questions correct. Since there are 8 geometry questions, she will get $8 \\times 1 = 8$ geometry questions correct.\n\n## 4: Calculate the number of history and geography questions Ava will get correct\nAva will get half of the history and geography questions correct. Since there are 36 questions for each of history and geography, she will get $36 \\times 0.5 = 18$ questions correct for each subject.\n\n## 5: Calculate the total number of questions Ava will get correct\nTo find the total number of questions Ava will get correct, we add the number of geometry questions she gets correct to the number of history and geography questions she gets correct. This is $8 + 18 + 18 = 44$ questions.\n\n## 6: Since each question is worth one point, the total number of points Ava is sure to get is equal to the total number of questions she will get correct.\nThe total number of points Ava is sure to get is 44.\n\n<answer>44</answer>",
