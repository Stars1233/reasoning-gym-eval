This means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. However, if all 7 statements are true, then Statement 3 (which claims exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true) must be false.\n\n## 2: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true, which means all statements are false. If Statement 3 is true, then all other statements, including Statement 1, must be false. However, this creates a contradiction because if Statement 3 is true (and thus all statements are false), Statement 1 cannot be true since it asserts at least 7 statements are true.\n\n## 3: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 3 Together\nGiven that Statement 1 and Statement 3 cannot both be true, and if Statement 3 is true then all statements are false (which would make Statement 3 false), Statement 3 must be false. This also means that not all statements can be false, supporting the possibility of Statement 1 being true.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 2 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 1 is true, then all statements must be true, which means there are 0 false statements, satisfying Statement 2.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements must be true.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given that Statement 3 must be false (from Step 3), for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n## 7: Evaluate Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. If there are 7 statements, the possible numbers of false statements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Composite numbers among these are 4, 6.\n\n## 9: Combine Information\n- From Statement 1 being potentially true, all statements could be true (7 true, 0 false).\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements are true and 4 are false.\n- Statement 5 being true means only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, and since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 could be true.\n- Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6).\n\n## 10: Assess Possible Scenarios\n1. All statements true: This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6 (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 (since 0 is not considered composite but this scenario makes 0 false statements). However, it makes Statement 3 and Statement 4 false. Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false.\n2. Statement 4 being true (3 true, 4 false): This makes Statement 4 true, Statement 3 false (satisfying Statement 5). It also satisfies Statement 6 (3 is prime) and Statement 7 (4 is composite).\n\n## 11: Detailed Evaluation of Scenario 1 (All True)\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True (0 false statements)\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: False\n- Statement 5: True (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false)\n- Statement 6: True (7 is prime)\n- Statement 7: True (0 is not composite, but this is a special case often not considered composite)\n\n## 12: Detailed Evaluation of Scenario 2 (Statement 4 True)\n- Statement 1: False (less than 7 true)\n- Statement 2: False (more than 2 false)\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: True (3 is prime)\n- Statement 7: True (4 is composite)\n\n## 13: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- The scenario where all statements are true seems plausible at first glance but requires careful checking against all statements.\n- The scenario with Statement 4 true (3 true, 4 false) also needs to satisfy all conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

This implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. However, if all 7 statements were false, Statement 2 would be true, which creates a paradox because Statement 2 allows for the possibility of all statements being false, but if all were false, it would mean Statement 2 is actually true, making one statement true.\n\n## 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements must be true, and 2 must be false.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number.

This scenario allows for 2 false statements (Statement 1 and Statement 4), which makes Statement 7 true (since 2 is not composite, this actually makes Statement 7 false). Statement 6 is false because 5 is prime. Statement 2 is true because at most 7 can be false.\n- If Statement 4 is true (5 true statements and 2 false), then Statement 3 must be false, and Statement 1 must be false. This makes Statement 5 true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## 10: Determine the Validity of Each Statement\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 and Statement 3 cannot both be true.\n- Statement 1 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true, which satisfies Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) and makes Statement 7 false (since 2 is not composite).\n\n## 11: Examine Prime and Composite Conditions\nThe number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) must be considered together with other statements.\n\n## 12: Solve for Possible Solutions\nLet's consider the scenarios:\n- If there are 6 true statements, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 6 is true (6 is not prime, so this scenario actually doesn't work for Statement 6).\n- If there are 7 true statements, all statements must be true, but this contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n## 13: Detailed Evaluation\nGiven Statement 4 is true (5 true, 2 false), Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false.

This means if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, and vice versa.\n\n## 10: Consider Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 indicates the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and Statement 7 indicates the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6), which translates to the number of true statements being 3 or 1.\n\n## 11: Synthesize Information\n- From Statement 2, we have 6 or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) together suggest that only 3 true statements could satisfy both being prime and having a composite number of false statements (since 7-3=4, which is composite).\n- However, Statement 3 and Statement 4 suggest 4 true statements, and Statement 5 says only one can be true.\n\n## 12: Detailed Evaluation of Possible True Statements\n- If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 2, Statement 6 are satisfied (since 7 is prime), but Statement 7 is not satisfied because 0 false statements is not composite.\n- If there are 6 true statements, then Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 are satisfied (since 6 is not prime, this actually doesn\u2019t satisfy Statement 6), but again, Statement 7 is not satisfied because 1 false statement is not composite.\n- If there are 4 true statements, then Statement 1 is satisfied, but Statement 2 is not. Statement 6 is not satisfied because 4 is not prime.\n\n## 13: Final Assessment\nGiven Statement 6 and Statement 7, and considering prime and composite numbers:\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) limits it to 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- The number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) limits the true statements to 3 or 1 (since 7-4=3 and 7-6=1).\n\n## 14: Checking for Consistency Across Statements\n- For 3 true statements: This satisfies Statement 6 (3 is prime) and Statement 7 (4 false statements, and 4 is composite). Statement 1 is satisfied (at least 4 true statements is not met), Statement 2 is not satisfied (more than 1 false statement), Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, and Statement 5 needs to be evaluated based on Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

This makes Statement 2 true (since 0 false statements is at most 1), Statement 3 false, Statement 4 false, Statement 5 true (since both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 true (7 is prime), and Statement 7 false (0 is not composite). This scenario has 6 true statements and 1 false statement, which does not match the initial assumption that all are true if Statement 1 is true.\n\n## 12: Re-evaluate Statement 3 and Its Implications\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 1 statement is true, and the rest (6 statements) are false. This would make Statement 1 false, Statement 2 true (since 6 false statements is more than 1, this actually makes Statement 2 false), Statement 4 false, Statement 5 true (because Statement 4 is false and Statement 3 is true), Statement 6 false (1 is not prime), and Statement 7 true (6 is composite).\n\n## 13: Evaluate Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false. This makes Statement 1 false, Statement 2 false (since 7 false statements is more than 1), Statement 3 false, Statement 5 false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true, but here Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, which actually makes Statement 5 true), Statement 6 false (0 is not prime), and Statement 7 false (7 is not composite).\n\n## 14: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and evaluations:\n- The only scenario that could potentially hold without immediate contradiction is when Statement 3 is true (1 true statement), making Statements 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 false, and Statement 5 true. However, this creates a contradiction with Statement 2 being false (since more than 1 statement is false).\n- If all statements are true (Statement 1), it leads to contradictions with other statements.\n- If all statements are false (Statement 4), it leads to a contradiction with Statement 5 being true.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

The possible number of false statements (from 0 to 7) that are composite are 4, 6.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2 Together\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all statements must be true, which makes Statement 2 also true. This scenario allows for 0 false statements, which is not composite (Statement 7 would be false), and 7 true statements, which is prime (Statement 6 would be true).\n\n## 9: Check for Consistency Across All Statements\n- If all statements are true (as Statement 1 suggests), then:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false because both 3 and 4 are false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 7 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## 10: Determine the Validity of Each Statement Under the Condition That All Are True\nUnder the condition that all statements are true:\n- Statement 1: True.\n- Statement 2: True.\n- Statement 3: False.\n- Statement 4: False.\n- Statement 5: False.\n- Statement 6: True.\n- Statement 7: False.\n\nThis gives us 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n\n## 11: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4\nGiven Statement 3 (exactly 5 true) and Statement 4 (exactly 2 false), if either is true, it must be that 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n## 12: Consider Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 5 is true, and assuming 5 statements are true and 2 are false (as per Statements 3 and 4), we need to see which combination works.\n\n## 13: Assess Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite (4, 6).\n\n## 14: Combine All Conditions\nGiven all conditions, let's see if there's a scenario where all can be satisfied:\n- For 7 true statements (Statement 1), we have 0 false statements. Statement 6 is satisfied (7 is prime), but Statement 7 is not (0 is not composite).\n- For exactly 5 true and 2 false (Statements 3 or 4), Statement 6 is satisfied (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is satisfied (2 is not composite, so this scenario doesn't fit).\n\n## 15: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements and their implications:\n- The only scenario where Statement 1 can be true is if all statements are true, but this leads to contradictions with Statements 3, 4, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 both suggest 5 true and 2 false statements. Statement 5 allows for one of them to be true but not both.\n- Statement 6 and Statement 7 provide additional constraints.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

This implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, which in turn means the number of true statements can be 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2.\n\n## 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 5 of the 7 statements are true. This directly specifies the number of true statements.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 2 of the 7 statements are false, which means exactly 5 statements are true.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4, 6. This implies the number of true statements can be 3 or 1 (since 7 - 4 = 3 and 7 - 6 = 1).\n\n## 8: Combine Information from Statements 1 and 2\nFrom Statement 1 and Statement 2, we can see that they both allow for the possibility of 5 true statements but restrict the possibilities differently. Statement 1 requires at least 5 true statements, and Statement 2 allows for at most 5 false statements, which is equivalent to at least 2 true statements.\n\n## 9: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together with Statement 5\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 both suggest there are exactly 5 true statements, but Statement 5 says only one of them can be true. If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements. If Statement 4 is true, then there are also exactly 5 true statements.\n\n## 10: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 indicates the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and Statement 7 indicates the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6), implying the number of true statements is 3 or 1.\n\n## 11: Find Overlapping Conditions\n- For 5 true statements (as in Statements 3 and 4), Statement 6 is satisfied (since 5 is prime) and Statement 7 is satisfied (since 2 false statements is not composite, but 2 is not an option; however, if we consider 5 true, 2 false, Statement 7 is not directly satisfied because 2 is not composite).\n- Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which directly implies 5 true statements.\n\n## 12: Detailed Evaluation of Possible Solutions\nGiven Statement 6, the possible number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7. Given Statement 7, the possible number of true statements is 1 or 3 (since 7-6=1 and 7-4=3). The intersection of these conditions with Statement 1 and Statement 2 needs to be considered.\n\n## 13: Checking for Consistency Across All Statements\n- If there are 5 true statements, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3 or Statement 4, and Statement 6 are satisfied. Statement 7 is not satisfied because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n- For 3 true statements, Statement 6 is not satisfied (3 is prime, so actually it is, my mistake), and Statement 7 is satisfied (4 false statements, and 4 is composite).\n\n## 14: Final Assessment\nConsidering all statements:\n- 5 true statements satisfy Statements 1, 2, 3 (or 4), and 6 but not 7.\n- The condition that exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true (Statement 5) limits the scenarios further.\n\n## 15: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 3 being true means 5 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6. But Statement 7 is not satisfied because 2 is not composite.\n- Statement 4 being true also means 5 statements are true, with the same implications.\n- Statement 5 allows only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that at least 5 of the 7 statements are true. This means the number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 5 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, which in turn means the number of true statements can be 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2.\n\n## 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 5 of the 7 statements are true. This directly specifies the number of true statements.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 2 of the 7 statements are false, which means exactly 5 statements are true.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4, 6. This implies the number of true statements can be 3 or 1 (since 7 - 4 = 3 and 7 - 6 = 1).\n\n## 8: Combine Information from Statements 1 and 2\nFrom Statement 1 and Statement 2, we can see that they both allow for the possibility of 5 true statements but restrict the possibilities differently. Statement 1 requires at least 5 true statements, and Statement 2 allows for at most 5 false statements, which is equivalent to at least 2 true statements.\n\n## 9: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together with Statement 5\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 both suggest there are exactly 5 true statements, but Statement 5 says only one of them can be true. If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements. If Statement 4 is true, then there are also exactly 5 true statements.\n\n## 10: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 indicates the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and Statement 7 indicates the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6), implying the number of true statements is 3 or 1.\n\n## 11: Find Overlapping Conditions\n- For 5 true statements (as in Statements 3 and 4), Statement 6 is satisfied (since 5 is prime) and Statement 7 is satisfied (since 2 false statements is not composite, but 2 is not an option; however, if we consider 5 true, 2 false, Statement 7 is not directly satisfied because 2 is not composite).\n- Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which directly implies 5 true statements.\n\n## 12: Detailed Evaluation of Possible Solutions\nGiven Statement 6, the possible number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7. Given Statement 7, the possible number of true statements is 1 or 3 (since 7-6=1 and 7-4=3). The intersection of these conditions with Statement 1 and Statement 2 needs to be considered.\n\n## 13: Checking for Consistency Across All Statements\n- If there are 5 true statements, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3 or Statement 4, and Statement 6 are satisfied. Statement 7 is not satisfied because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n- For 3 true statements, Statement 6 is not satisfied (3 is prime, so actually it is, my mistake), and Statement 7 is satisfied (4 false statements, and 4 is composite).\n\n## 14: Final Assessment\nConsidering all statements:\n- 5 true statements satisfy Statements 1, 2, 3 (or 4), and 6 but not 7.\n- The condition that exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true (Statement 5) limits the scenarios further.\n\n## 15: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 3 being true means 5 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6. But Statement 7 is not satisfied because 2 is not composite.\n- Statement 4 being true also means 5 statements are true, with the same implications.\n- Statement 5 allows only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

However, this scenario (only 1 true statement) contradicts Statement 1 unless Statement 1 is false.\n\n## 12: Consider the Implications of Statement 6 and Statement 7\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite. Given 7 statements, if 2 are true, 5 are false (composite); if 3 are true, 4 are false (composite); if 5 are true, 2 are false (not composite); if 7 are true, 0 are false (not composite).\n\n## 13: Synthesize Information\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 5 must be true because Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 2 being true implies all statements are true, which would make 0 statements false (not composite), contradicting Statement 7.\n\n## 14: Determine Possible Scenarios\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 3 being true means only 1 statement is true, which makes Statement 1 false, Statement 2 false, and potentially allows Statement 5 and Statement 7 to be true if conditions are met.\n- For Statement 6 and Statement 7 to both be true with prime true statements and composite false statements, scenarios with 2, 3, or 5 true statements are possible.\n\n## 15: Final Evaluation\nConsidering all statements and their implications:\n- If Statement 3 is true (1 true), Statement 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 are false. Statement 5 is true. This gives 1 true, 6 false. The number of false statements (6) is composite, and the number of true statements (1) is not prime (by definition, prime numbers are >1), so this scenario does not satisfy Statement 6.\n- Other scenarios need to satisfy Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 simultaneously.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

This means if Statement 1 is true, then there must be 2 or more true statements among them.\n\n## 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 0 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that all 7 statements must be true for Statement 2 to be true.\n\n## 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true. If Statement 3 is true, then it must be the only true statement.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false. This means all statements must be false for Statement 4 to be true, which creates a paradox since if all statements are false, then Statement 4 must be true, making it false. Thus, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 4 cannot be true (as deduced in Step 4), for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements can range from 0 to 7.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 4's Impact\nGiven Statement 4 is false (from Step 4), and if Statement 3 is true (making Statement 5 potentially true), we have at least one true statement.\n\n## 9: Consider Statement 2 and Statement 1 Together\nIf Statement 2 is true, then all statements must be true, which would make Statement 1 true as well. However, Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false does not directly conflict with this but Statement 4 being false is a given.\n\n## 10: Assess Possible Combinations Based on Prime and Composite Conditions\n- If there are 2 true statements (prime), Statement 1 is true.\n- If there are 3 true statements (prime), Statement 1 is true.\n- If there are 5 true statements (prime), Statement 1 is true.\n- If there are 7 true statements (prime), Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true.\n\n## 11: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true, which means Statement 5 could potentially be true if Statement 4 is false (which it is). However, this scenario (only 1 true statement) contradicts Statement 1 unless Statement 1 is false.\n\n## 12: Consider the Implications of Statement 6 and Statement 7\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite. Given 7 statements, if 2 are true, 5 are false (composite); if 3 are true, 4 are false (composite); if 5 are true, 2 are false (not composite); if 7 are true, 0 are false (not composite).\n\n## 13: Synthesize Information\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 5 must be true because Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 2 being true implies all statements are true, which would make 0 statements false (not composite), contradicting Statement 7.\n\n## 14: Determine Possible Scenarios\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 3 being true means only 1 statement is true, which makes Statement 1 false, Statement 2 false, and potentially allows Statement 5 and Statement 7 to be true if conditions are met.\n- For Statement 6 and Statement 7 to both be true with prime true statements and composite false statements, scenarios with 2, 3, or 5 true statements are possible.\n\n## 15: Final Evaluation\nConsidering all statements and their implications:\n- If Statement 3 is true (1 true), Statement 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 are false. Statement 5 is true. This gives 1 true, 6 false. The number of false statements (6) is composite, and the number of true statements (1) is not prime (by definition, prime numbers are >1), so this scenario does not satisfy Statement 6.\n- Other scenarios need to satisfy Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 simultaneously.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

Composite numbers less than 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true, then T = 2. But Statement 1 requires T \u2265 3, so Statement 3 cannot be true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then T = 5. This satisfies Statement 1.\n\n## 9: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7 with possible T values\nGiven Statement 6, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\nGiven Statement 7, F could be 4 or 6, meaning T could be 3 or 1.\n\n## 10: Combine Conditions\n- From Statement 1, T \u2265 3.\n- Statement 2 implies T \u2265 0, which is always true given Statement 1.\n- Statement 3 being false helps, as it allows T \u2260 2.\n- Statement 4 being true means T = 5.\n- Statement 5 being true means either T = 2 (Statement 3) or T = 5 (Statement 4), but not both. Since Statement 3 is false, T = 5 is a possibility.\n- Statement 6 suggests T is prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 suggests T is not 1 or 6 (since F = 4 or 6).\n\n## 11: Determine Possible Solutions\nGiven all conditions:\n- T = 5 satisfies Statements 1, 4, 6 (since 5 is prime), and potentially others.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n- T = 3 or T = 7 need to be checked against all statements.\n\n## 12: Check T = 3\n- T = 3 satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6 (since 3 is prime).\n- If T = 3, F = 4, which is composite, satisfying Statement 7.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied as F \u2264 7.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, which is consistent with Statement 5 if Statement 4 is false.\n\n## 13: Check T = 7\n- T = 7 satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6 (since 7 is prime).\n- If T = 7, F = 0, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied.\n\n## 14: Evaluate Statement 5 with T Values\nStatement 5 must be true, meaning either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 3 is false (from Step 8), Statement 4 being true (T = 5) is a valid scenario.\n\n## 15: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements:\n- For T = 5, Statements 1, 4, 5, and 6 are true. Statement 2 is also true. Statement 7 is false. This is 1 solution.\n- For T = 3, Statements 1, 6, 7 are true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is false and Statement 3 is false. This could potentially be another solution but needs verification against all statements.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

Composite numbers up to 7 are 4, 6.\n\n## 7: Assess possible solutions based on Statement 1 and Statement 2\n- If Statement 2 is true (at most 1 false statement), then we have two cases: all 7 statements are true (which would make Statement 1 true, Statement 2 true, but we need to check consistency with other statements), or 6 statements are true and 1 is false.\n- Given Statement 1 (at least 4 true), Statement 2 (at most 1 false), and Statement 3 (exactly 4 true), we need to find a consistent set.\n\n## 8: Check consistency of statements\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (Statement 3), then Statement 1 is also true. This gives us 4 true and 3 false statements.\n- Statement 4 being true would mean 4 statements are true and 3 are false, which aligns with Statement 3 being false.\n- Statement 5 being true means only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n\n## 9: Detailed analysis of Statement 6 and Statement 7\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6).\n\n## 10: Combine information\n- If 4 statements are true (as per Statement 3), then 3 are false. The number of false statements (3) is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n- Statement 6 says the number of true statements is prime; 4 is not prime, so if Statement 3 is true, Statement 6 is false.\n\n## 11: Evaluate Statement 2 and Statement 4 together\n- Statement 2 (at most 1 false) and Statement 4 (exactly 3 false) cannot both be true because they imply different numbers of false statements.\n\n## 12: Final assessment\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (Statement 5).\n- If Statement 3 is true, then 4 statements are true and 3 are false. This makes Statement 1 true, Statement 6 false (since 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 false (since 3 is not composite).\n- Statement 2 being true limits the false statements to at most 1, which contradicts Statement 4.\n\n## 13: Determine possible solutions\nConsidering all statements:\n- A possible scenario is Statement 3 being true (4 true statements), which makes Statement 1 true, and given Statement 5, Statement 4 must be false.\n- We must find a set that satisfies all conditions.\n\n## 14: Checking for prime and composite conditions\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) must be considered with the other statements.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

Therefore, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 5\nGiven that Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 must be true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 must be the one that is false according to Statement 5.\n\n## 3: Determine the Truth Value of Statement 3\nFrom Step 2, we know Statement 3 is false. Statement 3 claims exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is false, then the number of true statements is not exactly 2.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 says at least 4 of these 7 statements are true, and Statement 2 says at most 3 of these 7 statements are false.

This implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, but since there are only 7 statements, it essentially means that the number of true statements can be 0 or more, but given the context of all statements, it's about the possibility of all being false or not.\n\n## 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true. This gives a specific number of true statements.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means if Statement 3 is true (4 true statements), Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4, 6.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together with Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements. Statement 4 being false means there are not exactly 3 false statements, which aligns with 4 true statements (3 false statements). If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements as well (since 3 are false), making Statement 3 false.\n\n## 9: Consider Statement 1 and Statement 6\nStatement 1 requires at least 4 true statements. Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime. The primes that satisfy Statement 1 are 5 and 7.\n\n## 10: Consider Statement 7\nFor Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6). This means the number of true statements must be 3 or 1 (since 7-4=3 and 7-6=1).\n\n## 11: Combine Information\n- From Statement 3 and Statement 4, we have two scenarios for exactly 4 true statements.\n- Statement 5 allows only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true.\n- Statement 6 limits true statements to prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 limits false statements to composite numbers (4, 6), implying true statements could be 3 or 1.\n\n## 12: Evaluate Possible Solutions\nGiven Statement 6 and Statement 7 together, the possible number of true statements that are prime and allow for a composite number of false statements are limited. If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements (not composite). If there are 7 true statements, then there are 0 false statements (not composite). For 3 true statements, there are 4 false statements (composite), and for 1 true statement, there are 6 false statements (composite).\n\n## 13: Detailed Evaluation of Statements\n- Statement 1 and Statement 3 together imply at least 4 true statements and exactly 4 true statements, which can be satisfied.\n- Statement 4 implies 4 true statements as well.\n- Statement 5 being true means only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n\n## 14: Final Assessment\nConsidering all constraints:\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the scenarios provided, we see that:\n- 3 true statements (and 4 false) could work if Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- 5 true statements could work if Statement 1 is true, but we need to check against all statements.\n\n## 15: Checking Against All Statements\nIf there are exactly 4 true statements:\n- Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true satisfies Statement 5 if the other is false.\n- Statement 6 is not satisfied because 4 is not prime.\n- For 5 true statements:\n- Statement 1 is satisfied.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is not satisfied because 2 false statements are not composite.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

The number of true statements (4) is not a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7 are prime), so Statement 6 is false in this case. The number of false statements (3) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false in this case.\n\n## 10: Detailed Evaluation of Possible Scenarios\n- **Scenario 1 (Statement 3 is true):** 4 true statements, 3 false statements.

This scenario makes 5 statements true and 2 false, which contradicts the initial assumption of 4 true and 3 false.\n- **Scenario 2 (Statement 4 is true):** 4 true statements, 3 false statements. Similar to Scenario 1 but with Statement 4 being true and Statement 3 being false. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 5 true. Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. This scenario also results in 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n\n## 11: Checking for Consistency and Prime/Composite Conditions\nGiven that Statement 1 must be true, and considering the constraints:\n- For 4 true statements (as in both scenarios), Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) is false because 4 is not prime.\n- The number of false statements being 3 (not composite) makes Statement 7 false.\n\n## 12: Final Assessment\nConsidering all statements and their implications:\n- If Statement 3 is true, we have a contradiction as shown.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then we have 4 true statements and 3 false statements. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 5 being true, and the rest being false.\n\n## 13: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and analysis, there is exactly one consistent scenario where all statements can be evaluated for truthfulness without contradiction: Statement 4 being true, which leads to 4 true statements (Statements 1, 2, 4, 5) and 3 false statements (Statements 3, 6, 7).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

If Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement can be true, which means Statement 4 must be false. If Statement 4 is true, then all statements must be false, which directly contradicts Statement 4 being true since it claims all statements are false, including itself.

This is because if Statement 3 were true, it would imply only one statement is true, but we've established Statement 4 is false, and Statement 3 being true would mean Statement 5 could potentially be true as well, which would then make two true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 5), contradicting Statement 3's claim.\n\n## 3: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 says at least 4 of these 7 statements are true, and Statement 2 says at most 2 of these 7 statements are false.

Statement 6 could be true if 5 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 could be true if 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite, which it is not (2 is prime). This scenario allows for 5 true statements (Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, 7) and 2 false statements (Statements 3, 4), making Statement 2 true (at most 2 false statements) and Statement 7 false (since 2 is not composite).\n\n## 7: Check for Consistency Across All Statements\n- Statement 1: At least 4 of these 7 statements are true. With 5 true statements, this is true.\n- Statement 2: At most 2 of these 7 statements are false. With 2 false statements, this is true.\n- Statement 3: Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true. This is false.\n- Statement 4: Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false. This is false.\n- Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.

With 5 true statements, and 5 being prime, this is true.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements is a composite number. With 2 false statements, and 2 not being composite, this is false.\n\n## 8: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the analysis, there is exactly one combination that works: Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 3, 4, 7 are false. This makes 5 true statements and 2 false statements, satisfying all conditions without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Thus, Statement 4 cannot be true because if it were, it would have to be false, creating a paradox.\n\n## 2: Determine the Truth Value of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nGiven Statement 4 is false (because it cannot be true without creating a paradox), and considering Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, Statement 3 must be false. This is because if Statement 3 were true, it would imply only one statement is true, but we've established Statement 4 is false, and Statement 3 being true would mean Statement 5 could potentially be true as well, which would then make two true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 5), contradicting Statement 3's claim.\n\n## 3: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 says at least 4 of these 7 statements are true, and Statement 2 says at most 2 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 4 true statements. If Statement 2 is true, then there are at most 2 false statements, which implies at least 5 true statements.\n\n## 4: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number, and Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves (2, 3, 5, 7, ...). Composite numbers are numbers that have more than two factors (4, 6, 8, 9, ...).\n\n## 5: Analyze Possible Combinations Based on Previous Steps\nGiven Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, we know:\n- Statement 5 must be true because it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, and since Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 being false satisfies Statement 5 being true.\n\n## 6: Determine the Number of True and False Statements\nWith Statement 5 being true, and knowing Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false:\n- If there are exactly 5 true statements, then Statement 1 and Statement 2 could both be true. Statement 6 could be true if 5 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 could be true if 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite, which it is not (2 is prime). This scenario allows for 5 true statements (Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, 7) and 2 false statements (Statements 3, 4), making Statement 2 true (at most 2 false statements) and Statement 7 false (since 2 is not composite).\n\n## 7: Check for Consistency Across All Statements\n- Statement 1: At least 4 of these 7 statements are true. With 5 true statements, this is true.\n- Statement 2: At most 2 of these 7 statements are false. With 2 false statements, this is true.\n- Statement 3: Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true. This is false.\n- Statement 4: Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false. This is false.\n- Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This is true.\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements is a prime number. With 5 true statements, and 5 being prime, this is true.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements is a composite number. With 2 false statements, and 2 not being composite, this is false.\n\n## 8: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the analysis, there is exactly one combination that works: Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 3, 4, 7 are false. This makes 5 true statements and 2 false statements, satisfying all conditions without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 2 is true because at most 3 of the statements are false (in fact, none). Statement 4 is false because it claims exactly 2 statements are false, which contradicts our premise that all statements are true. Statement 5 is false because it claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both; if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, which aligns with this statement being false. Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number. Statement 7 is false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number. Since Statement 3 being true leads to a situation where not all statements can be true (specifically, Statement 4 and Statement 7 would be false), Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## 3: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.

This implies that between 4 and 7 statements must be true (since if 3 are false, 4 are true, and if 0 are false, 7 are true).\n\n## 9: Evaluating Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite (4, 6, ...). The possible numbers of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, 7. The possible numbers of false statements that are composite are 4, 6.\n\n## 10: Finding Compatible Scenarios\n- For 7 true statements, Statement 3 must be true, which we've ruled out.\n- For 5 true statements, 2 are false. Statement 4 is true, Statement 6 is true, but Statement 7 is false (2 is prime, not composite).\n- For 3 true statements, 4 are false. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is false (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite).\n\n## 11: Checking for Valid Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- If there are 5 true statements (and thus 2 false), Statement 4, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true. This makes Statement 3, Statement 7 false, which fits.\n- If there are 3 true statements, then Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 7 are true.

So, if Statement 4 is true, we have a potential set of true statements.\n\n## 5: Checking Statement 5's Condition\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. We've established Statement 3 is false. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 5 is true.\n\n## 6: Evaluating Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. If 5 statements are true, this is prime. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. If 2 statements are false, this is not composite (it's prime).\n\n## 7: Considering the Possibility of Statement 4 Being False\nIf Statement 4 is false, then either more or fewer than 2 statements are false. Given Statement 3 is false, we have at least one false statement.\n\n## 8: Analyzing Statement 1 and Statement 2 Together\nStatement 1 says at least 3 of these statements are true, and Statement 2 says at most 3 of these statements are false. This implies that between 4 and 7 statements must be true (since if 3 are false, 4 are true, and if 0 are false, 7 are true).\n\n## 9: Evaluating Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite (4, 6, ...). The possible numbers of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, 7. The possible numbers of false statements that are composite are 4, 6.\n\n## 10: Finding Compatible Scenarios\n- For 7 true statements, Statement 3 must be true, which we've ruled out.\n- For 5 true statements, 2 are false. Statement 4 is true, Statement 6 is true, but Statement 7 is false (2 is prime, not composite).\n- For 3 true statements, 4 are false. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is false (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite).\n\n## 11: Checking for Valid Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- If there are 5 true statements (and thus 2 false), Statement 4, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true. This makes Statement 3, Statement 7 false, which fits.\n- If there are 3 true statements, then Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 7 are true. This scenario needs to be checked against all statements for consistency.\n\n## 12: Detailed Check for 3 True Statements\nWith 3 true statements:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, which actually makes Statement 5 false, not true.\n- This scenario does not work because Statement 5 cannot be true if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n\n## 13: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the analysis, the scenario with 5 true statements and 2 false statements seems viable: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true, and Statement 3 and Statement 7 are false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## 6: Determine the consistency of statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true (3 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false (by Statement 5), and there would be 4 false statements. This makes Statement 7 true (since 4 is composite) and Statement 6 false (since 3 is prime but 3 true statements do not align with Statement 1's requirement of at least 5 true statements).\n- If Statement 4 is true (1 false statement, hence 6 true statements), then Statement 3 must be false. This scenario makes Statement 1 true (at least 5 true statements), Statement 2 true (at most 1 false statement), Statement 6 true (6 is not prime, this statement would be false), and Statement 7 true (since 1 is not composite, this statement would be false).\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2 together with other statements.\nGiven Statement 1 (at least 5 true) and Statement 2 (at most 1 false), if both are true, then there must be exactly 6 true statements and exactly 1 false statement. This scenario aligns with Statement 4 being true and Statement 3 being false.\n\n## 8: Check for prime and composite conditions.\nWith 6 true statements and 1 false statement: Statement 6 is false (because 6 is not a prime number), and Statement 7 is false (because 1 is not a composite number). Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n## 9: Evaluate all statements for consistency.\n- Statement 1: True (6 true statements).\n- Statement 2: True (1 false statement).\n- Statement 3: False (as it claims 3 true statements).\n- Statement 4: True (1 false statement).\n- Statement 5: True (Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false).\n- Statement 6: False (6 is not prime).\n- Statement 7: False (1 is not composite).\n\n## 10: Conclusion on the number of possible solutions.\nGiven the constraints and analysis, we need to find a set that satisfies all true statements and the conditions they impose. The only consistent scenario that emerges from the analysis is having 6 true statements and 1 false statement, which aligns with Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 being true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

This scenario actually cannot hold because if all statements are true, then Statement 5's condition (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true) is violated since both are false.\n\n## 12: Consider Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true (2 true statements), then Statement 1 must be false (because it claims at least 7 true statements). Statement 2 could be true if 2 or fewer statements are false, which aligns with 5 false statements. Statement 4 must be false (because it claims 4 false statements). Statement 5 could be true if Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 could be false because 2 is a prime number, but we need to check if this setup allows for a prime number of true statements and a composite number of false statements. Statement 7 could be true if 5 (the number of false statements) is composite, which it is.\n\n## 13: Consider Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true (4 false statements, 3 true statements), then Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 could be true because at most 2 false statements aligns with having 4 false statements not being an issue but having 3 true does satisfy \"at most 2 false\". Statement 3 must be false. Statement 5 could be true because Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 could be true because 3 is a prime number. Statement 7 could be true because 4 is a composite number.\n\n## 14: Determine Possible Solutions Based on Prime and Composite Conditions\n- For Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements), we evaluate:\n- If there are 2 true statements (Statement 3 true), 5 false statements (composite), this could work.\n- If there are 3 true statements (Statement 4 true), 4 false statements (composite), this could work.\n\n## 15: Evaluate Statement 5's Impact\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means we have two scenarios to consider based on Statement 5 being true:\n1. Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false.\n2. Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true.\n\n## 16: Assess Consistency Across Statements\nGiven the constraints:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then Statements 1, 4, and potentially others must be false.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then Statements 1, 3, and potentially others must be false.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7, and Statement 3 are true, and Statement 4 is false. Statement 1 being true is consistent with at least 1 statement being true. Statement 2 being true means at most 3 statements are false, which is consistent with only 1 statement (Statement 4) being false. Statement 5 being true is consistent because it allows Statement 3 to be true and Statement 4 to be false. For Statement 6, the number of true statements (6) is a prime number, which is consistent. For Statement 7, the number of false statements (1) is not a composite number (a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself), which makes Statement 7 false. However, we assumed Statement 7 is true for this scenario, which creates a contradiction.\n\n## 3: Evaluate Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false. This implies that Statement 3 is false (from Statement 5). For Statement 4 to be true, and given that Statement 5 is also true (because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, and we've chosen Statement 4 to be true), we have to find a combination where exactly 3 statements are false. Statement 1 says at least 1 of these statements is true, which is obviously true given Statement 4 is true. Statement 2 says at most 3 of these statements are false, which is also true if exactly 3 are false. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number; if 4 statements are true (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and one more), then 4 is not a prime number, but if exactly 3 are false, then 4 statements are true, which does not fit because 4 is not prime. However, if we consider 3 false statements, Statement 6 could be one of the true ones if the number of true statements is prime (which would be 4 true statements). Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number; if there are exactly 3 false statements, 3 is not a composite number (it's prime), making Statement 7 false.\n\n## 4: Detailed Evaluation of Possible Scenarios\n- If Statement 3 is true, we have a contradiction as shown (Statement 7 would be false, but we counted it as true).\n- For Statement 4 being true, and thus Statement 3 being false, we need to assess Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because at most 3 can be false. Statement 5 is true because it allows Statement 4 to be true and Statement 3 to be false. Statement 6 needs the number of true statements to be prime; if 4 are true, this works because 4 is not prime, indicating a mistake in assuming 4 true statements directly without checking all statements. Statement 7 needs the number of false statements to be composite; with 3 false statements, this does not work because 3 is prime.\n\n## 5: Re-evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 for Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number (4, 6, ...). Given 7 statements, if 4 are true, 3 are false (prime, not composite), and if 5 are true, 2 are false (prime, not composite), if 6 are true, 1 is false (not composite), and if 3 are true, 4 are false (composite).\n\n## 6: Checking for Consistency Across All Statements\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 1 (true), Statement 4 (true), and Statement 5 (true) could be true, with the rest false. Statement 2 would be false because more than 3 statements (4) are false. Statement 6 is false because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. This scenario seems plausible.\n- For 4 true statements: This would mean 3 false statements, making Statement 4 true, Statement 7 false (since 3 is prime), and potentially others.\n\n## 7: Final Assessment\nGiven the constraints and evaluations:\n- The scenario where Statement 3 is true leads to a contradiction.\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) gives specific conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number; if 4 statements are true (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and one more), then 4 is not a prime number, but if exactly 3 are false, then 4 statements are true, which does not fit because 4 is not prime. However, if we consider 3 false statements, Statement 6 could be one of the true ones if the number of true statements is prime (which would be 4 true statements). Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number; if there are exactly 3 false statements, 3 is not a composite number (it's prime), making Statement 7 false.\n\n## 4: Detailed Evaluation of Possible Scenarios\n- If Statement 3 is true, we have a contradiction as shown (Statement 7 would be false, but we counted it as true).\n- For Statement 4 being true, and thus Statement 3 being false, we need to assess Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because at most 3 can be false. Statement 5 is true because it allows Statement 4 to be true and Statement 3 to be false. Statement 6 needs the number of true statements to be prime; if 4 are true, this works because 4 is not prime, indicating a mistake in assuming 4 true statements directly without checking all statements. Statement 7 needs the number of false statements to be composite; with 3 false statements, this does not work because 3 is prime.\n\n## 5: Re-evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 for Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number (4, 6, ...). Given 7 statements, if 4 are true, 3 are false (prime, not composite), and if 5 are true, 2 are false (prime, not composite), if 6 are true, 1 is false (not composite), and if 3 are true, 4 are false (composite).\n\n## 6: Checking for Consistency Across All Statements\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 1 (true), Statement 4 (true), and Statement 5 (true) could be true, with the rest false. Statement 2 would be false because more than 3 statements (4) are false. Statement 6 is false because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. This scenario seems plausible.\n- For 4 true statements: This would mean 3 false statements, making Statement 4 true, Statement 7 false (since 3 is prime), and potentially others.\n\n## 7: Final Assessment\nGiven the constraints and evaluations:\n- The scenario where Statement 3 is true leads to a contradiction.\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) gives specific conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4, 6.\n\n## 8: Evaluating Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together with Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true (exactly 6 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false (because of Statement 5). If Statement 4 is true (all 7 statements true), then Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## 9: Checking for Consistency with Statement 1 and Statement 2\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are 6 true statements and 1 false statement, satisfying Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements are true, satisfying Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n\n## 10: Evaluating Statement 6 and Statement 7\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime. This could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite. This could be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements could be 3 or 1.\n\n## 11: Combining Information\nGiven Statement 1 and Statement 2, the possible number of true statements is constrained to 6 or 7 (from Statement 1) and 5, 6, or 7 (from Statement 2), overlapping at 6 or 7.\n\n## 12: Detailed Evaluation of Statements 3, 4, and 5\n- If Statement 3 is true (6 true statements), then Statement 6 is true (since 6 is not prime, this creates a contradiction).\n- If Statement 4 is true (7 true statements), then Statement 6 is true (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 0 is not composite).\n\n## 13: Checking Statement 6 and Statement 7 with Possible Scenarios\n- Statement 6 being true means we have 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements. Only 7 fits with Statement 1 and Statement 2 directly.\n- Statement 7 being true means we have 3 or 1 false statements (hence 4 or 6 true statements), which does not directly align with Statement 1 and Statement 2's direct implications.\n\n## 14: Final Assessment\nConsidering all statements:\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n- If all statements are true (Statement 4), then Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true (7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (0 false statements, 0 is not composite).\n- The scenario where exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3) leaves Statement 4 false, which could satisfy other conditions but needs to align with prime and composite requirements.\n\n## 15: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- The only scenario that fits without contradiction is when Statement 4 is true (all statements true), making Statement 3 false, and thus Statement 5 true.\n- In this case, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true, and Statement 3 and Statement 7 are false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. However, if all 7 statements are true, then Statement 4, which claims exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false, must be false. This does not immediately contradict Statement 1 but sets a condition that all statements being true is a possible scenario to consider.\n\n## 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says at most 5 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that at least 2 of the statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, it allows for a range of true statements from 2 to 7.\n\n## 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then 3 statements are true, and 4 are false.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then all statements must be false, which directly contradicts Statement 4 itself, making Statement 4 false.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.

Statement 7 is satisfied because 4 (the number of false statements) is composite.\n\n## 10: Evaluate Consistency Across Statements\n- If Statement 3 is true, then 3 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 3 is prime) and Statement 7 (since 4 is composite).\n- Statement 2 allows for up to 5 false statements, which is consistent with Statement 3 being true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n\n## 11: Determine Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with Statement 7.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- If Statement 3 is true, it provides a consistent solution with Statements 5, 6, and 7.\n\n## 12: Final Assessment\nConsidering all statements, the only consistent scenario without direct contradiction appears to be when Statement 3 is true, making exactly 3 statements true.

Given 7 statements, if 2 are true, 5 are false (composite); if 3 are true, 4 are false (composite); if 5 are true, 2 are false (not composite); if 7 are true, 0 are false (not composite).\n\n## 11: Combine Information\n- If Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements are true.\n- Statement 4 being true means exactly 1 statement is false, which supports Statement 1.\n- Statement 3 being true means exactly 3 statements are true, which does not support Statement 1.\n\n## 12: Detailed Evaluation of Statements\nGiven Statement 4 is true (1 false statement), and assuming Statement 1 is also true, we have 6 true statements. This satisfies Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements, since 1 is not composite, this actually doesn't fit perfectly but let's continue evaluating). Statement 2 is also satisfied because at most 5 statements are false (only 1 is false). Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n## 13: Checking for Consistency\n- If Statement 1, Statement 4, and Statement 6 are true, then we have 6 true statements and 1 false statement. This makes Statement 2 true (at most 5 false), Statement 7 false (1 is not composite), and Statement 3 false (not exactly 3 true). Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n## 14: Final Assessment\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 and Statement 4 being true gives us 6 true statements.\n- This scenario makes Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 true.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 7 are false in this scenario.\n\nThe final number of true statements is 6 (which is not prime, so Statement 6 is actually false in this detailed assessment), and the number of false statements is 1 (which is not composite). This means our initial assumption about Statement 1 and Statement 4 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 6 and Statement 7 under strict definitions.\n\n## 15: Re-evaluation\nUpon re-evaluation, considering all statements and their implications:\n- The only consistent scenario without direct contradiction is when we carefully match the conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

Statement 5 is true because it allows either Statement 3 or 4 to be true but not both. This gives us 6 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption of T = 5 for this specific scenario.\n\n## 12: Evaluate Other Potential Prime T Values\n- For T = 2, Statement 1 is true, Statement 3 and 4 are false. Statement 2 is true (since F = 5, which is not at most 4, this scenario actually doesn't work because it violates Statement 2).\n- For T = 3, Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 7 is true (since F = 4, which is composite). This scenario could potentially work.\n\n## 13: Detailed Check for T = 3\n- T = 3, F = 4. Statement 1 (true), Statement 2 (true), Statement 6 (true), Statement 7 (true). Statement 3 and 4 are false. Statement 5 is also false because neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true. This gives us 4 true statements, which does not match our T = 3 assumption for all statements' truth values.\n\n## 14: Evaluate T = 7\n- If T = 7, then all statements must be true, but Statement 1 being true (at least 2 true) is automatically satisfied. However, Statement 2 (at most 4 false) is false because there are 0 false statements.\n\n## 15: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and analyzing each statement's implications on the truth values of others, we find potential solutions:\n- The scenario where T = 5 seems promising but leads to contradictions upon detailed examination.\n- For T = 3 or other values, we must ensure all statements' conditions are met without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

If Statement 3 is true, then 1 statement is false. If Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are false. Given Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we have to consider the implications of each being true separately.\n\n## 3: Consider Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true. This means Statement 4 must be false (because of Statement 5). Statement 1 is true because at least 6 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 1 statement (Statement 4) is false.

However, Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number; with 1 false statement, Statement 7 is true because 1 is not considered a composite number (it's neither prime nor composite). This scenario results in Statement 6 being false, which fits because we have 6 true statements.\n\n## 4: Consider Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are false. This implies that Statement 3 is false (by Statement 5). With 2 statements being true (Statement 4 and one other), Statement 1 is false because not at least 6 statements are true. Statement 2 is false because more than 1 statement is false. For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements (2) must be a prime number, which it is.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are positive integers that have at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. The number of false statements being composite means it could be 4, 6, 8, etc.\n\n## 6: Combine Information\n- If Statement 3 is true, we have 6 true statements and 1 false statement. Statement 6 is false (6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (1 is not composite). This scenario cannot occur because it violates Statement 5 indirectly by making Statement 6 and Statement 7 false, which would mean more than 1 statement is false if we count Statement 3 as one of the true ones, but directly, it fits the bill of having 6 true statements but doesn't satisfy all conditions simultaneously upon closer inspection.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true, and 5 are false. This makes Statement 1 and Statement 2 false. Statement 6 is true (2 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (5 is not composite, which was an error in initial assessment - 5 is prime). This scenario actually doesn't fit because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## 7: Detailed Assessment of Feasibility\nUpon a detailed assessment:\n- For Statement 3 being true: This gives us 6 true statements. Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5 (because Statement 4 is false), Statement 7 are true. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number. This scenario is feasible.\n- For Statement 4 being true: This gives us 2 true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 6, and possibly Statement 7 if conditions fit).

So, this direct scenario doesn't fit well under strict conditions.\n\n## 8: Final Evaluation\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation:\n- The only scenario that fits without contradiction is when Statement 3 is true. This makes Statements 1, 2, 4 (false), 5 (true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false), 6 (false), and 7 (false) have specific truth values.

If all statements are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both false, which contradicts Statement 5 because it requires one to be true and the other false.\n\n## 7: Assess Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims, 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' If all 7 statements are true, then the number of true statements is 7, which is a prime number. Thus, Statement 6 is true.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 7\nStatement 7 says, 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' If all statements are true, then there are 0 false statements. The number 0 is not considered a composite number (it's a special case), so Statement 7 would be false.\n\n## 9: Identify the Paradox\nGiven that Statement 2 being true leads to all statements being true, we find:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false (because both 3 and 4 are false).\n- Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is false.\n\nThis results in 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n\n## 10: Re-evaluate Statements with New Information\n- Statement 1 ('At least 4 of these 7 statements are true') is true because there are 5 true statements.\n- Statement 2 ('At most 0 of these 7 statements are false') is false because there are 2 false statements.\n- Statement 3 ('Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true') is false.\n- Statement 4 ('Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false') is false.\n- Statement 5 ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both') is true because both are false.\n- Statement 6 ('The number of true statements is a prime number') is true because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 ('The number of false statements is a composite number') is true because 2 is a prime number, not composite.\n\n## 11: Determine the Consistency of Statements\nGiven the assessment:\n- We have 5 true statements (1, 5, 6, 7, and actually Statement 2 is false but let's correct the assessment based on truth values).\n- The correct count based on initial assumptions needs adjustment.\n\n## 12: Final Assessment\nCorrecting the approach:\n- If Statement 2 is false, it means there can be more than 0 false statements.\n- Statement 1 is true (at least 4 true).\n- Statement 3 is false (not exactly 4 true).\n- Statement 4 is false (not exactly 3 false).\n- Statement 5 is true (since both 3 and 4 are false).\n- Statement 6 is true (5 true statements, 5 is prime).\n- Statement 7 is true (2 false statements, 2 is prime, not composite).\n\n## 13: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven that we have a scenario where Statements 1, 5, 6, and 7 can be true, and considering the constraints:\n- The number of true statements must be prime (Statement 6), which is satisfied with 5 true statements.\n- The number of false statements must be composite (Statement 7), but with 2 false statements, it's prime, not composite.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

Statement 5 says one of them is true, but not both. If Statement 4 is true (3 false statements), then there are 4 true statements. This scenario allows for Statement 3 to be false.\n\n## 12: Evaluate Statement 1 with Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then there are 3 false statements, which means there are 4 true statements.
