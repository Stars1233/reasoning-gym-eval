This involves dividing by 15 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\n## 4: Perform the division steps for base conversion\n- $19281 \\div 15 = 1285$ remainder $6$.\n- $1285 \\div 15 = 85$ remainder $10$.\n- $85 \\div 15 = 5$ remainder $10$.\n- $5 \\div 15 = 0$ remainder $5$.\n\n## 5: Write down the base-15 number\nThe remainders from last to first give the base-15 representation: $5, 10, 10, 6$. Since $10$ in base-15 is represented by $a$ (because $a = 10$ in base-15, using $a-z$ for digits above 9), the base-15 number is $5aa6$.\n\n<answer>5aa6</answer>",

We do this by dividing the number by 13 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\n## 4: Perform the division steps for base conversion\n- \\(20628 \\div 13 = 1587\\) remainder 9\n- \\(1587 \\div 13 = 122\\) remainder 1\n- \\(122 \\div 13 = 9\\) remainder 5\n- \\(9 \\div 13 = 0\\) remainder 9\n\n## 5: Write down the base-13 number\nStarting from the last remainder, the base-13 representation is 9519.\n\n<answer>9519</answer>",
