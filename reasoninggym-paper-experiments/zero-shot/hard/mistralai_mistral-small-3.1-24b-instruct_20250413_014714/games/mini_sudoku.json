Each column must contain each number from 1 to 4 exactly once.\n3. Each 2x2 subgrid must contain each number from 1 to 4 exactly once.\n\nLet's fill in the puzzle step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with the given numbers:\n   _ _ _ 3\n   2 _ _ 4\n   _ _ _ 1\n   3 _ 4 2\n\n2. Analyze the first row and first column:\n   - The first row must contain 1, 2, and 4.\n   - The first column must contain 1, 3, and 4.\n   - The top-left 2x2 subgrid must contain 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n3. Fill in the top-left 2x2 subgrid:\n   - The number 2 is already in the first row and first column, so it cannot be in the top-left 2x2 subgrid.\n   - The number 3 is in the first column, so it cannot be in the top-left 2x2 subgrid.\n   - The number 4 is in the first row, so it cannot be in the top-left 2x2 subgrid.\n   - Therefore, the top-left 2x2 subgrid must contain 1.\n\n   1 _ _ 3\n   2 _ _ 4\n   _ _ _ 1\n   3 _ 4 2\n\n4. Fill in the remaining numbers in the first row:\n   - The first row must contain 2, 3, and 4.\n   - The number 2 cannot be in the second column (already in the second row).\n   - The number 3 cannot be in the second column (already in the first column).\n   - Therefore, the number 2 must be in the second column.\n\n   1 2 _ 3\n   2 _ _ 4\n   _ _ _ 1\n   3 _ 4 2\n\n5. Fill in the remaining numbers in the first column:\n   - The first column must contain 3 and 4.\n   - The number 3 cannot be in the third row (already in the fourth row).\n   - Therefore, the number 3 must be in the third row.\n\n   1 2 _ 3\n   2 _ _ 4\n   3 _ _ 1\n   3 _ 4 2\n\n6. Fill in the remaining numbers in the second row:\n   - The second row must contain 1 and 3.\n   - The number 1 cannot be in the second column (already in the first row).\n   - Therefore, the number 1 must be in the second column.\n\n   1 2 _ 3\n   2 1 _ 4\n   3 _ _ 1\n   3 _ 4 2\n\n7.
