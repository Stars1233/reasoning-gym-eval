First, let's identify the rows and columns that already have queens placed on the board.\n   - There is a queen in the 2nd row, 3rd column.\n   - There is a queen in the 3rd row, 1st column.\n   - There is a queen in the 6th row, 2nd column.\n   - There is a queen in the 8th row, 4th column.\n\n2. Next, let's identify the diagonals that are occupied by these queens.\n   - The queen in the 2nd row, 3rd column occupies the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right starting at (1, 2) and the diagonal from top-right to bottom-left starting at (2, 3).\n   - The queen in the 3rd row, 1st column occupies the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right starting at (1, 1) and the diagonal from top-right to bottom-left starting at (3, 1).\n   - The queen in the 6th row, 2nd column occupies the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right starting at (1, 1) and the diagonal from top-right to bottom-left starting at (6, 2).\n   - The queen in the 8th row, 4th column occupies the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right starting at (4, 4) and the diagonal from top-right to bottom-left starting at (8, 4).\n\n3. Now, we need to place the remaining queens in such a way that they do not attack each other. We need to place one queen in each of the remaining rows and columns, avoiding the occupied diagonals.\n   - Place a queen in the 1st row, 5th column.\n   - Place a queen in the 4th row, 7th column.\n   - Place a queen in the 5th row, 8th column.\n   - Place a queen in the 7th row, 6th column.\n\n4. Verify that no two queens attack each other by checking rows, columns, and diagonals.\n   - Rows: Each row has exactly one queen.\n   - Columns: Each column has exactly one queen.\n   - Diagonals: No two queens share the same diagonal.\n\n<answer>\n_ _ _ _ Q _ _ _\n_ _ Q _ _ _ _ _\nQ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ Q _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ Q _\n_ Q _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ Q _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ Q\n</answer>",
