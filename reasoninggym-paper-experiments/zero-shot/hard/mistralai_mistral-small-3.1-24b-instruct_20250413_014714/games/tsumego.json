In the game of Go, capturing stones typically involves surrounding them in such a way that they have no liberties (empty points adjacent to them).\n\nLet's examine the board:\n\n```\n   A B C D E F\n 6 . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . .\n 4 . O O . . O\n 3 . O X . . .\n 2 X O O X . O\n 1 X O . . X X\n```\n\n1. **Identify potential capture points**:\n   - The white stones at B2 and C2 are surrounded by Black stones on three sides (A2, B1, and C1). Placing a Black stone at B1 would capture these three white stones.\n   - The white stone at D1 is surrounded by Black stones on two sides (C1 and E1). Placing a Black stone at D1 would capture this white stone.\n\n2. **Evaluate the best move**:\n   - Placing a Black stone at B1 captures three white stones (B2, C2, and D2).\n   - Placing a Black stone at D1 captures one white stone (D1).\n\nGiven these options, placing a Black stone at B1 is the optimal move as it captures the most white stones.\n\n<answer>B1</answer>",
