Therefore, Statement 1 must be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then at least 5 statements must be true. However, we already know that Statement 1 is false. If Statement 2 is true, then at most 2 statements can be false, which means at least 5 statements must be true.
