      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this cryptarithm, we need to assign unique digits to each letter such that the sum of the numbers represented by the letters matches the given equation. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the problem:**\n   ```\n     DAAD\n      SVV\n    RYVFG\n    RGVSG\n   +  DSF\n   --------\n    FZZYVV\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the length of each number:**\n   - `DAAD` is a four-digit number.\n   - `SVV` is a three-digit number.\n   - `RYVFG` and `RGVSG` are five-digit numbers.\n   - `DSF` is a three-digit number.\n   - `FZZYVV` is a six-digit number.\n\n3. **Analyze the sum:**\n   - The sum of four five-digit numbers and one four-digit number results in a six-digit number.\n   - This implies that the leading digit of `FZZYVV` must be 1 because the sum of the leading digits of the addends must be at least 10 to result in a six-digit number.\n\n4. **Assign digits to letters:**\n   - Since `F` is the leading digit of `FZZYVV`, `F` must be 1.\n   - `Z` must be 0 because it is the second digit of `FZZYVV` and the sum of the second digits of the addends must result in a number ending in 0.\n\n5. **Determine other digits:**\n   - `DAAD` must be a number where the thousands digit `D` is not zero.\n   - `SVV` must be a number where the hundreds digit `S` is not zero.\n   - `RYVFG` and `RGVSG` must be numbers where the ten-thousands digit `R` is not zero.\n   - `DSF` must be a number where the hundreds digit `D` is not zero.\n\n6. **Test possible values:**\n   - By trial and error, we can test possible values for the letters while ensuring that each letter represents a unique digit.\n   - After testing various combinations, we find that the following assignment satisfies the equation:\n     - `D = 5`\n     - `A = 3`\n     - `S = 6`\n     - `V = 2`\n     - `R = 9`\n     - `Y = 8`\n     - `F = 1`\n     - `G = 7`\n     - `Z = 0`\n\n7. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Substitute the values back into the equation to ensure the sum is correct.\n   - `DAAD = 5335`\n   - `SVV = 622`\n   - `RYVFG = 98172`\n   - `RGVSG = 96726`\n   - `DSF = 516`\n   - `FZZYVV = 100835`\n\n8. **Sum the values:**\n   - `5335 + 622 + 98172 + 96726 + 516 = 201371`\n   - This does not match `FZZYVV = 100835`, so we need to re-evaluate our assignment.\n   -

          "full_model_response": "To solve this cryptarithm, we need to assign unique digits to each letter such that the sum of the numbers represented by the letters matches the given equation. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the problem:**\n   ```\n     DAAD\n      SVV\n    RYVFG\n    RGVSG\n   +  DSF\n   --------\n    FZZYVV\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the length of each number:**\n   - `DAAD` is a four-digit number.\n   - `SVV` is a three-digit number.\n   - `RYVFG` and `RGVSG` are five-digit numbers.\n   - `DSF` is a three-digit number.\n   - `FZZYVV` is a six-digit number.\n\n3. **Analyze the sum:**\n   - The sum of four five-digit numbers and one four-digit number results in a six-digit number.\n   - This implies that the leading digit of `FZZYVV` must be 1 because the sum of the leading digits of the addends must be at least 10 to result in a six-digit number.\n\n4. **Assign digits to letters:**\n   - Since `F` is the leading digit of `FZZYVV`, `F` must be 1.\n   - `Z` must be 0 because it is the second digit of `FZZYVV` and the sum of the second digits of the addends must result in a number ending in 0.\n\n5. **Determine other digits:**\n   - `DAAD` must be a number where the thousands digit `D` is not zero.\n   - `SVV` must be a number where the hundreds digit `S` is not zero.\n   - `RYVFG` and `RGVSG` must be numbers where the ten-thousands digit `R` is not zero.\n   - `DSF` must be a number where the hundreds digit `D` is not zero.\n\n6. **Test possible values:**\n   - By trial and error, we can test possible values for the letters while ensuring that each letter represents a unique digit.\n   - After testing various combinations, we find that the following assignment satisfies the equation:\n     - `D = 5`\n     - `A = 3`\n     - `S = 6`\n     - `V = 2`\n     - `R = 9`\n     - `Y = 8`\n     - `F = 1`\n     - `G = 7`\n     - `Z = 0`\n\n7. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Substitute the values back into the equation to ensure the sum is correct.\n   - `DAAD = 5335`\n   - `SVV = 622`\n   - `RYVFG = 98172`\n   - `RGVSG = 96726`\n   - `DSF = 516`\n   - `FZZYVV = 100835`\n\n8. **Sum the values:**\n   - `5335 + 622 + 98172 + 96726 + 516 = 201371`\n   - This does not match `FZZYVV = 100835`, so we need to re-evaluate our assignment.\n   -

Since `K` appears in the units place of both `TQRK` and `KFX`, and the sum in the units place results in `F` (which is 1), `K` must be 9 (as 9 + 9 = 18, and the units digit is 8, which fits with `F` being 1).\n\n5. **Determine the value of `Q`**:\n   - `Q` is the second digit of `TQRK` and the leading digit of `QUGXU`. Since `Q` appears in the tens place of `TQRK` and the hundreds place of `QUGXU`, and the sum in the tens place results in `W` (which is not yet determined), we need to consider the carry from the units place. Since `K` is 9, there is a carry of 1 to the tens place. Thus, `Q` must be 8 (as 8 + 8 + 1 = 17, and the tens digit is 7, which fits with `W` being 7).\n\n6. **Determine the value of `U`**:\n   - `U` is the last digit of `USUR` and `QUGXU`. Since `U` appears in the units place of both `USUR` and `QUGXU`, and the sum in the units place results in `R` (which is not yet determined), we need to consider the carry from the tens place. Since `Q` is 8, there is a carry of 1 to the units place. Thus, `U` must be 6 (as 6 + 6 + 1 = 13, and the units digit is 3, which fits with `R` being 3).\n\n7. **Determine the value of `S`**:\n   - `S` is the second digit of `USUR`. Since `S` appears in the tens place of `USUR`, and the sum in the tens place results in `U` (which is 6), we need to consider the carry from the units place. Since `U` is 6, there is a carry of 1 to the tens place. Thus, `S` must be 5 (as 5 + 5 + 1 = 11, and the tens digit is 1, which fits with `U` being 6).\n\n8. **Determine the value of `R`**:\n   - `R` is the third digit of `TQRK` and `USUR`. Since `R` appears in the hundreds place of `USUR`, and the sum in the hundreds place results in `Q` (which is 8), we need to consider the carry from the tens place.

Since `G` appears in the thousands place of `FWQGF`, and the sum in the thousands place results in `G` (which is not yet determined), we need to consider the carry from the hundreds place. Since `R` is 3, there is a carry of 1 to the thousands place. Thus, `G` must be 4 (as 4 + 4 + 1 = 9, and the thousands digit is 9, which fits with `G` being 4).\n\n10. **Determine the value of `W`**:\n    - `W` is the third digit of `FWQGF`. Since `W` appears in the tens place of `FWQGF`, and the sum in the tens place results in `W` (which is not yet determined), we need to consider the carry from the hundreds place. Since `G` is 4, there is a carry of 1 to the tens place.

Since `X` appears in the hundreds place of `QUGXU`, and the sum in the hundreds place results in `W` (which is 7), we need to consider the carry from the tens place. Since `U` is 6, there is a carry of 1 to the hundreds place. Thus, `X` must be 2 (as 2 + 2 + 1 = 5, and the hundreds digit is 5, which fits with `W` being 7).\n\n12. **Determine the value of `P`**:\n    - `P` is the second digit of `FSFF`. Since `P` appears in the tens place of `FSFF`, and the sum in the tens place results in `P` (which is not yet determined), we need to consider the carry from the units place. Since `F` is 1, there is a carry of 1 to the tens place.
