This gives us 1X per 2B.\n   - **Rule 3**: Dismantle pairs of machine C into parts Y. This gives us 1Y per 2C.\n   - **Rule 4**: Combine machine B and C into machine A. This uses 1B and 1C to make 1A.\n   - **Rule 5**: Combine parts X and Y into parts Z. This uses 1X and 1Y to make 1Z.\n\n3. **Iterative Process**:\n   - Apply Rule 1: 52A -> 104X, 52Y. State: 0A, 73B, 87C, 104X, 52Y, 0Z.\n   - Apply Rule 2: 73B -> 36X (since 72B can be dismantled into 36X, 1B left). State: 0A, 1B, 87C, 140X, 52Y, 0Z.\n   - Apply Rule 3: 87C -> 43Y (since 86C can be dismantled into 43Y, 1C left). State: 0A, 1B, 1C, 140X, 95Y, 0Z.\n   - Apply Rule 4: 1B, 1C -> 1A. State: 1A, 0B, 0C, 140X, 95Y, 0Z.\n   - Apply Rule 5: 140X, 95Y -> 95Z (since 95 pairs of X and Y can be combined into 95Z, 45X left). State: 1A, 0B, 0C, 45X, 0Y, 95Z.\n\n4. **Repeat the Process**:\n   - Apply Rule 1: 1A -> 2X, 1Y. State: 0A, 0B, 0C, 47X, 1Y, 95Z.\n   - Apply Rule 5: 47X, 1Y -> 1Z (since 1 pair of X and Y can be combined into 1Z, 46X left).
