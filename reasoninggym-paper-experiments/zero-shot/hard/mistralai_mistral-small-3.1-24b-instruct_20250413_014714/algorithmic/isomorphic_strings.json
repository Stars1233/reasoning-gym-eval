If the loop completes without finding any inconsistencies, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nLet's apply this step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize dictionaries:\n   - `map1_to_2 = {}`\n   - `map2_to_1 = {}``\n\n2. Iterate through the strings:\n   - For `g` and `y`: Update `map1_to_2['g'] = 'y'` and `map2_to_1['y'] = 'g'`.\n   - For `q` and `p`: Update `map1_to_2['q'] = 'p'` and `map2_to_1['p'] = 'q'`.\n   - For `i` and `n`: Update `map1_to_2['i'] = 'n'` and `map2_to_1['n'] = 'i'`.\n   - Continue this process for all characters.\n\n3. Check for inconsistencies:\n   - If at any point a character from String 1 maps to more than one character in String 2, or vice versa, return False.\n   - If no inconsistencies are found, return True.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, we find that there are no inconsistencies.\n\n<answer>True</answer>",
