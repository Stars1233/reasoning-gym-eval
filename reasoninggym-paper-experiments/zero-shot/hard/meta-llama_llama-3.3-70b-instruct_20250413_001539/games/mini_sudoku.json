column of the fourth row is the number that would not cause any column to have two of the same number.\nThe correct solution for the third column of the fourth row can only be a 2.\nThe final answer is:\n1 3 4 2\n3 4 2 1\n3 2 1 4\n4 1 2 3",

Given the first row, it must be \"2 3 1 4\" to satisfy the conditions.\n- The third row is \"_ _ _ 1\".

The fourth row is given as \"3 _ 4 2\". With the constraints from the first three rows, it must satisfy the subgrid, row, and column rules.\n\nGiven these constraints and correcting the mistake, the proper solution would adhere to Sudoku rules, ensuring each row, column, and subgrid contains each number exactly once.
