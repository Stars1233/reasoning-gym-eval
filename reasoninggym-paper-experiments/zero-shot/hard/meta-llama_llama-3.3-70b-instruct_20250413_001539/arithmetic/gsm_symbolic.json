Since on Tuesday he sold 15 fewer boxes of cherry pie than on Monday, he sold 26 - 15 = 11 boxes of cherry pie on Tuesday.\n\nWe're also told that on Monday, William sold 14 more boxes of brownie than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he sold 28 boxes of brownie. So, on Monday, he sold 28 + 14 = 42 boxes of brownie.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total earnings from brownies and cherry pies over the two days:\n\n- Brownies sold on Monday: 42 boxes * $13 = 546\n- Brownies sold on Tuesday: 28 boxes * $13 = 364\n- Total from brownies: 546 + 364 = 910\n\n- Cherry pies sold on Monday: 26 boxes * $24 = 624\n- Cherry pies sold on Tuesday: 11 boxes * $24 = 264\n- Total from cherry pies: 624 + 264 = 888\n\nTotal earnings over the two days: 910 + 888 = 1798\n\n<answer>1798</answer>",
