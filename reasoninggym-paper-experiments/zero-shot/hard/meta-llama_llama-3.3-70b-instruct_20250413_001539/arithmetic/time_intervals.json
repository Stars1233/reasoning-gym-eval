Calculate the difference in seconds and milliseconds:\n- From 13:31:16.310 to 14:00:00.000 is 28 minutes and 43 seconds and 690 milliseconds.\n- 28 minutes = 28 * 60 = 1680 seconds\n- Adding the 43 seconds gives 1680 + 43 = 1723 seconds\n- The milliseconds from 13:31:16.310 to 14:00:00.000 are 690 milliseconds short of a full second, so we subtract this from the full second difference: 1000 - 690 = 310 milliseconds added to the 43 seconds, making it 43.310 seconds.\n- However, since we are calculating total seconds, we simplify this step by directly considering the time difference:\n- The time from 13:31:16.310 to 14:00:00.000 is 28 minutes and 43.690 seconds (since 1 second = 1000 milliseconds, and we had 310 milliseconds to add to the 43 seconds, but we actually need to account for the subtraction of 690 milliseconds from a full second, which was an error in explanation).\n- Correct approach: \n  - 13:31:16.310 to 13:31:16.000 is -0.310 seconds (or 310 milliseconds less).\n  - Then, from 13:31:16.000 to 14:00:00.000 is 28 minutes and 44 seconds.\n  - Then, from 14:00:00.000 to 14:16:00.656 is 16 minutes and 0.656 seconds.\n  \n2. Calculate the total duration:\n- The correct calculation directly considers the time difference without splitting into unnecessary components:\n- From 13:31:16.310 to 14:16:00.656, considering the error in the initial step-by-step, we directly calculate:\n  - 44 minutes and 44 seconds (from 13:31 to 14:15) plus the additional 16 seconds and 656 milliseconds minus the initial 310 milliseconds.\n  \nGiven the error in the detailed breakdown, let's simplify and correct the calculation directly:\n- The time difference is 44 minutes and 44 seconds (to reach 14:15:00 from 13:31:00) plus the additional 16 seconds and 656 milliseconds, then subtract the initial 310 milliseconds.\n\nCorrect calculation:\n- Time difference in seconds and milliseconds between 13:31:16.310 and 14:16:00.656:\n  - 44 minutes = 44 * 60 = 2640 seconds\n  - Plus 44 seconds = 2640 + 44 = 2684 seconds\n  - Plus 16 seconds = 2684 + 16 = 2700 seconds\n  - Milliseconds: 656 - 310 = 346 milliseconds\n\nTherefore, the duration is 44 minutes and 44 seconds (initial miscalculation corrected directly in final calculation) plus the additional seconds and milliseconds, resulting in:\n44 minutes + 44 seconds + 16 seconds = 45 minutes, and since we've added an extra minute in the verbal explanation, let's correct that to the actual calculation directly without the error:\n45 minutes is incorrect due to the miscalculation in the explanation process. The correct approach directly calculates the time difference without the confusion:\n- From 13:31 to 14:16 is 45 minutes.\n- The seconds difference is directly calculated as 44 seconds (to reach the minute) plus the additional seconds and accounting for milliseconds.\n\nThe correct duration calculation directly without the step-by-step confusion:\n- 45 minutes (which was a correct intuition but incorrectly justified)\n- And the seconds and milliseconds difference.\n\nDirect Calculation:\n- 14:16:00.656 - 13:31:16.310 = 44 minutes and 44.346 seconds.\n\nTherefore, converting this into the correct format:\n44 minutes + 44 seconds = 45 minutes - 1 minute (since we've counted one minute twice in the 44 minutes and the additional seconds) and then adding the 44 seconds and the milliseconds:\nThe correct approach to calculate the duration is simply subtracting the start time from the end time:\n14:16:00.656 - 13:31:16.310 = 44 minutes and 44.346 seconds.\n\nGiven the format and the direct calculation, the answer should reflect the time difference correctly calculated:\n45 minutes - 1 minute (for the double-counted minute in explanation) is not the right way to express this calculation due to the confusion in the explanation.

Convert both times into total seconds (including milliseconds as a fraction of a second):\n- Start time in seconds: \\(3 \\times 3600 + 32 \\times 60 + 30 + \\frac{187}{1000}\\)\n- End time in seconds: \\(8 \\times 3600 + 40 \\times 60 + 36 + \\frac{659}{1000}\\)\n\nCalculating:\n- Start time in seconds: \\(10800 + 1920 + 30 + 0.187 = 12750.187\\)\n- End time in seconds: \\(28800 + 2400 + 36 + 0.659 = 31236.659\\)\n\n2. Calculate the difference in seconds:\n- Difference = End time in seconds - Start time in seconds\n- Difference = \\(31236.659 - 12750.187 = 18486.472\\) seconds\n\n3. Convert the difference back into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds:\n- Hours: \\(18486.472 \\div 3600 = 5.135\\)\n- Since we are calculating duration, we'll consider the whole number part for hours and continue with the remainder for minutes.\n- Hours: 5\n- Remaining seconds: \\(18486.472 - (5 \\times 3600) = 18486.472 - 18000 = 486.472\\)\n- Minutes: \\(486.472 \\div 60 = 8.107\\)\n- Considering the whole number part for minutes:\n- Minutes: 8\n- Remaining seconds: \\(486.472 - (8 \\times 60) = 486.472 - 480 = 6.472\\)\n- Seconds: 6\n- Milliseconds: \\(0.472 \\times 1000 = 472\\)\n\nTherefore, the operation duration is 05:08:06.472.\n\n<answer>05:08:06.472</answer>",

So, to convert it to UTC, we add 1 hour.\n- Start time in UTC: 2358-04-20 04:51:19 UTC\n\nThe end time is -0900, which means it is 9 hours behind UTC.

Convert the total seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds:\n   - Hours: 2215 / 3600 = 0 (since we're looking for the remainder after whole hours, and 2215 is less than 3600, the hour part is 0).\n   - Remaining seconds after subtracting hours: 2215.\n   - Minutes: 2215 / 60 = 36 remainder 55.\n   - So, the time difference is 0 hours, 36 minutes, and 55 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the time difference in HH:MM:SS format is 00:36:55.\n\n<answer>00:36:55</answer>",
