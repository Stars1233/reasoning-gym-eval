Next, perform the multiplication and division operations from left to right:\n   -17 * -28 = 476\n   -56 * -7 = 392\n   Since division by 1 does not change the value, we have:\n   392 / 1 = 392\n\n4. Now, the equation becomes:\n   -20 + -44 - -69 + 476 - 392\n\n5. Finally, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:\n   -20 + -44 = -64\n   -64 - -69 = -64 + 69 = 5\n   5 + 476 = 481\n   481 - 392 = 89\n\n<answer>89</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To calculate the given expression, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nFirst, calculate the division inside the first parentheses: \n408 / 51 = 8\n\nThen, calculate the expression inside the second parentheses:\n-108 + 966 - (-282) + 376\n= -108 + 966 + 282 + 376\n= 1516\n\nNow, multiply the result of the division by the result of the expression inside the second parentheses:\n8 * 1516 = 12128\n\nNext, add and subtract the remaining numbers in the expression from left to right:\n12128 + 319 = 12447\n12447 - 463 = 11984\n11984 - 367 = 11617\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is:\n<answer>11617</answer>",
