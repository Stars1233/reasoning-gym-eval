Therefore, in 13 full weeks, there are 13 Saturdays.\n\n## Step 10: Determine if there are any additional Saturdays in the remaining days\nThe period starts on a Tuesday. After 13 full weeks (which include 13 Saturdays), we have 3 remaining days. These days would be Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, given the starting day of the week.

Calculate the total number of days between January 6, 2022, and May 7, 2022:\n- January has 31 days, but we start from the 6th, so 31 - 5 = 26 days in January.\n- February 2022 has 28 days (since 2022 is not a leap year).\n- March has 31 days.\n- April has 30 days.\n- May has 7 days (since we are counting up to May 7).\n\nTotal days = 26 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 7 (May) = 122 days.\n\n2. Calculate the number of complete weeks within this period:\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of days by 7.\n- 122 days / 7 days per week = 17 weeks and 3 days (since 122 = 17*7 + 3).\n\n3. Determine the business days in complete weeks:\nEach week has 5 business days (Monday through Friday).\n- 17 weeks * 5 business days per week = 85 business days.\n\n4. Calculate business days in the remaining 3 days:\nGiven that the period starts on a Thursday and ends on a Saturday, the extra days beyond complete weeks need to be examined for business days.\n- The first day (Thursday, January 6) is a business day.\n- The period ends on a Saturday, so we look at the last few days: Thursday (May 5), Friday (May 6), and Saturday (May 7). Thursday and Friday are business days.\n\nHowever, since we're counting from January 6 to May 7 inclusively and have already accounted for complete weeks, we only need to consider how these extra days fall:\n- The initial Thursday (Jan 6) is counted in the initial week's business days.\n- The final Thursday and Friday (May 5 and May 6) are the additional business days beyond the complete weeks.\n\nSo, the additional business days from the incomplete week at the end are 2 (Thursday and Friday before the Saturday, May 7).\n\n5. Add the business days from complete weeks and the additional business days:\nTotal business days = 85 (from complete weeks) + 2 (additional days) = 87.\n\nHowever, this calculation approach simplifies to directly counting the days or using a calendar to ensure accuracy, especially considering holidays are not accounted for in this basic calculation.

May has 31 days, so from May 28 to May 31, there are 3 days. June has 30 days, and July has 31 days. From August 1 to August 9, there are 9 days. Therefore, the total number of days from May 28 to August 9 is 3 (remaining days in May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 9 (days in August) = 73 days.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the day of the week for the starting date\nThe starting date is Saturday, May 28, 2022.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks and remaining days\nSince we are looking for Fridays, we need to determine how many complete weeks (7-day periods) are included in the 73 days, and then identify any additional days that might include a Friday. 73 days divided by 7 days per week gives us 10 full weeks (70 days) and 3 additional days.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of Fridays in the full weeks\nEach week has exactly one Friday. Since there are 10 full weeks, there are 10 Fridays within these weeks.\n\n## Step 5: Identify if there are any Fridays in the remaining days\nThe 3 additional days after the 10 full weeks will determine if there is an extra Friday. Since the period starts on a Saturday, we need to calculate the day of the week for the last day (August 9, 2022) to understand the distribution of the extra days. August 9, 2022, is a Tuesday. Counting back, August 8 is a Monday, August 7 is a Sunday, August 6 is a Saturday, and August 5 is a Friday. This means one of the extra days is a Friday.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the starting day of the period\nGiven that the period starts on a Saturday (May 28), we should check if the first day or any of the initial days of the period include a Friday. Since May 28 is a Saturday, the first Friday within the period would be May 29 (Sunday), May 30 (Monday), May 31 (Tuesday), and then June 3 would be the first Friday. This step ensures we are not missing a Friday at the beginning of the period.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of Fridays\nFrom the full weeks, we have 10 Fridays. From the additional days, we found 1 extra Friday (August 5). We should also consider if the starting week contributes an additional Friday that hasn't been counted yet. Given the start date of May 28 (Saturday), the first Friday after this date within the period is June 3, which is already included in the count of Fridays from the full weeks. Therefore, we do not need to add another Friday for the starting week.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",

October has 31 days, so from October 27 to October 31, there are 5 days. November has 30 days, and December has 21 days up to and including December 21. Therefore, the total number of days is 5 (from October) + 30 (from November) + 21 (from December) = 56 days.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of weeks in the given period\nSince there are 7 days in a week, divide the total number of days by 7 to find the number of complete weeks. 56 days / 7 days per week = 8 weeks.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of Thursdays in the complete weeks\nIn each week, there is exactly 1 Thursday. Therefore, in 8 complete weeks, there are 8 Thursdays.\n\n## Step 4: Check for additional Thursdays\nSince the period starts on a Thursday and ends on a Wednesday, we need to check if there are any additional Thursdays beyond the complete weeks. The first day (October 27) is a Thursday, and since we've already counted 8 Thursdays in the complete weeks, we need to see if there's an extra Thursday after the last complete week. The last day of the period is Wednesday, December 21, which means the Thursday before it would be December 15, and we've already counted this Thursday in our 8 weeks. However, we must consider that the period starts on a Thursday, which might add an extra Thursday if it's not part of a complete week within the period. Given that October 27 is the first day and it's a Thursday, and we've calculated the weeks from there, this initial Thursday is indeed part of the count of Thursdays within the complete weeks.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of Thursdays\nGiven that we have 8 Thursdays from the complete weeks, and considering the start and end dates, we confirm that there are no additional Thursdays beyond what's included in the complete weeks because both the starting and ending Thursdays are accounted for within those weeks.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
