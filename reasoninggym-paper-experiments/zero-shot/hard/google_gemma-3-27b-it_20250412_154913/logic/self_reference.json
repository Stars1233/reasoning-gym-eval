This means Statement 3 (\"Exactly 2 are true\") is false, and Statement 4 (\"Exactly 4 are false\") is false. Statement 5 (\"Either 3 or 4 is true\") is false. Statement 6 (\"Number of true statements is prime\") is true (7 is prime). Statement 7 (\"Number of false statements is composite\") is false (0 is not composite). This creates a contradiction because not all statements can be true.\n\n*   **If Statement 3 is true:** Exactly 2 statements are true. Then Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 4 is false. Since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true. The number of true statements is 2, which is prime, so Statement 6 is true. The number of false statements is 5, which is prime, so Statement 7 is false. This means we have 4 true statements (3, 5, 6) and 3 false statements (1, 2, 4, 7).

This contradicts the assumption that exactly 4 statements are false.\n\n*   **Consider the case where Statement 2 is true:** At most 2 statements are false, meaning at least 5 are true.

Therefore, Statement 5 is equivalent to $(T=4 \\text{ and } F \\ne 3) \\text{ or } (F=3 \\text{ and } T \\ne 4)$, which is always false.\nStatement 6: $T$ is a prime number.\nStatement 7: $F$ is a composite number.\n\nSince Statement 5 is false, we have $T \\ne 4$ and $F \\ne 3$.\nFrom Statement 3 and Statement 4, we have $T=4$ and $F=3$. However, Statement 5 says that exactly one of these is true, which means they cannot both be true. Since Statement 5 is false, both statements 3 and 4 must be false. Thus, $T \\ne 4$ and $F \\ne 3$.\n\nSince $T \\ne 4$ and $F \\ne 3$, we have $T \\ne 4$ and $T \\ne 4$, so $T \\ne 4$.\nAlso, $F = 7-T$, so $7-T \\ne 3$, which means $T \\ne 4$.\n\nFrom Statement 1, $T \\ge 1$.\nFrom Statement 2, $T \\ge 2$.\nFrom Statement 6, $T$ is a prime number. Possible values for $T$ are 2, 3, 5, 7.\nFrom Statement 7, $F = 7-T$ is a composite number.\nIf $T=2$, then $F=5$, which is prime. So $T \\ne 2$.\nIf $T=3$, then $F=4$, which is composite. So $T=3$ is a possible solution.\nIf $T=5$, then $F=2$, which is prime. So $T \\ne 5$.\nIf $T=7$, then $F=0$, which is neither prime nor composite. So $T \\ne 7$.\n\nThus, the only possible solution is $T=3$ and $F=4$.\nLet's check if $T=3$ and $F=4$ satisfy the statements:\nStatement 1: $T \\ge 1$, so $3 \\ge 1$ (True)\nStatement 2: $F \\le 5$, so $4 \\le 5$ (True)\nStatement 3: $T = 4$, so $3 = 4$ (False)\nStatement 4: $F = 3$, so $4 = 3$ (False)\nStatement 5: $(T=4 \\text{ and } F \\ne 3) \\text{ or } (F=3 \\text{ and } T \\ne 4)$. Since $T \\ne 4$ and $F \\ne 3$, this is False.\nStatement 6: $T$ is a prime number, so $3$ is prime (True)\nStatement 7: $F$ is a composite number, so $4$ is composite (True)\n\nThe number of true statements is 4 (Statements 1, 2, 6, 7).\nThe number of false statements is 3 (Statements 3, 4, 5).\nSince $T=3$ and $F=4$ doesn't work, we need to re-evaluate.\n\nWe have $T \\ge 2$, $T \\ne 4$, $T$ is prime, and $7-T$ is composite.\n$T=2$, $F=5$, $F$ is prime, not composite.\n$T=3$, $F=4$, $F$ is composite. This works.\n$T=5$, $F=2$, $F$ is prime, not composite.\n$T=7$, $F=0$, $F$ is neither prime nor composite.\n\nIf $T=3$ and $F=4$, then:\nStatement 1: $3 \\ge 1$ (True)\nStatement 2: $4 \\le 5$ (True)\nStatement 3: $3 = 4$ (False)\nStatement 4: $4 = 3$ (False)\nStatement 5: $(3=4 \\text{ and } 4 \\ne 3) \\text{ or } (4=3 \\text{ and } 3 \\ne 4)$ (False)\nStatement 6: $3$ is prime (True)\nStatement 7: $4$ is composite (True)\nTotal true statements: 4.\n\nSince $T=4$ is false, and $F=3$ is false, Statement 5 is false.\nIf $T=4$, $F=3$, then\nStatement 1: $4 \\ge 1$ (True)\nStatement 2: $3 \\le 5$ (True)\nStatement 3: $4 = 4$ (True)\nStatement 4: $3 = 3$ (True)\nStatement 5: $(4=4 \\text{ and } 3 \\ne 3) \\text{ or } (3=3 \\text{ and } 4 \\ne 4)$ (False)\nStatement 6: $4$ is prime (False)\nStatement 7: $3$ is composite (False)\nTotal true statements: 4.\n\nLet's consider the case where $T=4$ and $F=3$.\nStatements 1 and 2 are true.\nStatements 3 and 4 are true.\nStatement 5 is false.\nStatements 6 and 7 are false.\nThus, there are 4 true statements.\n\nIf $T=4$, then $F=3$.\nStatement 1 is true.\nStatement 2 is true.\nStatement 3 is true.\nStatement 4 is true.\nStatement 5 is false.\nStatement 6 is false.\nStatement 7 is false.\nTotal true statements: 4.\n\nThere is only one possible solution, where $T=4$ and $F=3$.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This creates a complex logical puzzle.\n\n2. **Consider Statement 1 and Statement 2:**\n   - Statement 1 says at least 6 are true.\n   - Statement 2 says at most 1 is false.\n   These statements are equivalent. If at least 6 are true, then at most 1 is false, and vice versa.  So, either 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n3. **Consider Statement 3 and Statement 4:**\n   - Statement 3 says exactly 6 are true.\n   - Statement 4 says exactly 5 are false (which means 2 are true).\n   These statements are mutually exclusive.\n\n4. **Consider Statement 5:**\n   - Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n5. **Case 1: Statement 3 is true (exactly 6 are true):**\n   - If Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false.\n   - Since Statement 3 is true, Statements 1 and 2 are also true.\n   - The number of true statements is 6, which is not a prime number. Therefore, Statement 6 is false.\n   - The number of false statements is 1, which is not a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 is false.\n   - In this case, the true statements are 1, 2, and 3. The false statements are 4, 5, 6, and 7. This is consistent with exactly 6 true statements.\n\n6. **Case 2: Statement 4 is true (exactly 2 are true):**\n   - If Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false.\n   - Since Statement 4 is true, there are 5 false statements. This means Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false.\n   - The number of true statements is 2, which is a prime number. Therefore, Statement 6 is true.\n   - The number of false statements is 5, which is a prime number. Therefore, Statement 7 is false.\n   - In this case, the true statements are 4 and 6. The false statements are 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. This is a contradiction because Statement 1 and 2 must be false.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate Case 2:**\n    - If Statement 4 is true, then Statements 1 and 2 are false.\n    - The number of true statements is 2.\n    - Statement 6 states the number of true statements is prime, so Statement 6 is true.\n    - The number of false statements is 5, which is prime, so Statement 7 is false.\n    - The true statements are 4 and 6. The false statements are 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n    - Statement 5 says either 3 or 4 is true, but not both. Since 4 is true, 3 must be false. This is consistent.\n    - However, we assumed Statement 4 is true, meaning exactly 5 statements are false. But we have 5 false statements (1, 2, 3, 5, 7). This is consistent.\n\n8. **Check for consistency:**\n   - In Case 1, we have 3 true statements (1, 2, 3) and 4 false statements (4, 5, 6, 7).

This does not satisfy the condition that at least 6 are true.\n\n9. **Final Analysis:**\n   - Case 1 is the only consistent solution. Statement 3 is true, so exactly 6 statements are true.\n   - Statement 1 and 2 are true, statement 3 is true, statement 4, 5, 6, and 7 are false.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This means there are 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n   - Statement 1: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\" (True)\n   - Statement 2: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\" (False)\n   - Statement 3: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\" (True)\n   - Statement 4: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" (False)\n   - Statement 5: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\" (True)\n   - Statement 6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\" (False, 4 is not prime)\n   - Statement 7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\" (False, 3 is prime)\n   In this case, we have 3 true statements (1, 3, 5). This is consistent.\n\n6. **Case 2: Statement 4 is True (Exactly 3 False)**\n   - If Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false. This means there are 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n   - Statement 1: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\" (True)\n   - Statement 2: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\" (False)\n   - Statement 3: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\" (False)\n   - Statement 4: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" (True)\n   - Statement 5: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\" (True)\n   - Statement 6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\" (True, 4 is not prime, so this is false)\n   - Statement 7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\" (True, 3 is prime, so this is false)\n   In this case, we have 2 true statements (1, 4, 5). This is not consistent.\n\n7. **Final Check:** Only Case 1 is logically consistent. In Case 1, statements 1, 3, and 5 are true, and statements 2, 4, 6, and 7 are false. This satisfies all conditions.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",
