Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Statements 3 and 4 are equivalent**: Both state that the number of true statements is 4 (or equivalently, the number of false statements is 3). Therefore, they must have the same truth value.\n2. **Statement 5 must be false**: Since statements 3 and 4 are equivalent, they cannot be true exclusively. Thus, statement 5 is false.\n3. **Analyzing possible values for T (number of true statements)**:\n   - **T = 0**: All statements are false.\n     - Statement 1 (false), Statement 2 (false), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (false), Statement 6 (false), Statement 7 (false).\n     - Consistent because all statements are false, and the number of false statements (7) is prime (statement 7 is false).\n   - **T = 1**: Only Statement 7 is true.\n     - Statement 7 is true because the number of false statements (6) is composite.\n     - Other statements are false, which is consistent.\n   - **T = 2**: Statements 1 and 6 are true.\n     - Statement 1 (true, as T \u2265 2), Statement 6 (true, as 2 is prime).\n     - Other statements are false, which is consistent.\n   - **T = 3**: Statements 1, 6, and 7 are true.\n     - Statement 1 (true, as T \u2265 2), Statement 6 (true, as 3 is prime), Statement 7 (true, as 4 false statements are composite).\n     - Other statements are false, which is consistent.\n   - **T = 4, 5, 6, 7**: These values lead to contradictions in the consistency of the statements' truth values.\n\nThus, the valid values for T are 0, 1, 2, and 3, resulting in **4 possible solutions**.\n\n<answer>4</answer>",
