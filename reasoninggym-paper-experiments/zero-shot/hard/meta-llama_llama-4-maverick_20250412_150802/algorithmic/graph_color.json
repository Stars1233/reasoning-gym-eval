The given graph has 10 vertices (0 through 9) and 2 edges: (5, 7) and (5, 9).\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure\nThe graph has vertices [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and edges [(5, 7), (5, 9)]. This means that vertex 5 is connected to vertices 7 and 9, and there are no other connections between any other vertices.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Constraints\nThe constraint is that no two vertices connected by an edge should have the same color. This directly affects vertices 5, 7, and 9. Vertex 5 is connected to 7 and 9, so 5, 7, and 9 must all have different colors.\n\n## Step 3: Assign Colors to Vertices 5, 7, and 9\nSince vertices 5, 7, and 9 are the only ones with edges, we start with them. We have 4 possible colors: [1, 2, 3, 4]. We can assign color 1 to vertex 5, color 2 to vertex 7, and color 3 to vertex 9.

However, to keep it simple and follow the rule that every vertex is not connected to a vertex of the same color, we can assign any of the 4 colors to these vertices. A straightforward approach is to assign a color that hasn't been used by their neighbors (if any). For vertices without any neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8), we can pick any color.\n\n## Step 5: Color the Remaining Vertices\nLet's color the remaining vertices with one of the available colors. Since there's no restriction on them due to the lack of edges, we can simply use one color for all of them or mix and match. For simplicity, let's assign color 1 (or any single color) to all of them, but we need to ensure that the chosen color doesn't conflict with the colors of their non-existent neighbors. Actually, we should check if any of these vertices are connected to 5, 7, or 9 indirectly, but since there are no other edges, they are not. So, we can freely assign a color.

We need to assign one of four colors (1, 2, 3, 4) to each vertex so that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n\n2. **Approach**: A common approach to solve graph coloring problems is to use a backtracking algorithm.

This is a classic graph coloring problem.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given graph:\n\n- Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]\n- Edges: [(0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 12), (1, 11), (2, 8), (3, 10), (3, 12), (3, 13), (4, 6), (5, 10), (5, 13), (6, 12), (7, 12)]\n- Possible colors: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure\nThe graph has 14 vertices and 13 edges. To color the graph, we should first identify any isolated vertices or subgraphs.\n\n## Step 2: Identify Isolated Vertices or Subgraphs\nLet's list the edges and identify the neighbors of each vertex:\n- 0: 7, 9, 12\n- 1: 11\n- 2: 8\n- 3: 10, 12, 13\n- 4: 6\n- 5: 10, 13\n- 6: 4, 12\n- 7: 0, 12\n- 8: 2\n- 9: 0\n- 10: 3, 5\n- 11: 1\n- 12: 0, 3, 6, 7\n- 13: 3, 5\n\n## Step 3: Color the Vertices\nWe will start coloring the vertices using the available colors (1, 2, 3, 4) and ensure that adjacent vertices do not have the same color. We can start with vertex 0 and proceed systematically.\n\n## Step 4: Assign Colors\nLet's start assigning colors to the vertices:\n- Vertex 0 is connected to 7, 9, and 12. Let's color 0 with color 1.\n- Vertex 1 is connected to 11. Color 1 with color 1, and 11 with color 2.\n- Vertex 2 is connected to 8. Color 2 with color 1, and 8 with color 2.\n- Vertex 3 is connected to 10, 12, and 13. Since 12 is connected to 0 (color 1), and 0 is already colored with 1, we need to color 12 differently. Let's come back to this after coloring other vertices.\n- Vertex 4 is connected to 6. Color 4 with color 1, and 6 with color 2.\n- Vertex 5 is connected to 10 and 13. We'll come back to this.\n- Vertex 7 is connected to 0 and 12. Since 0 is colored with 1, color 7 with 2.\n- Vertex 9 is connected to 0. Color 9 with 2 (since 0 is colored with 1).\n- Vertex 10 is connected to 3 and 5. We'll come back to this.\n- Vertex 12 is connected to 0, 3, 6, and 7. Since 0 and 7 are colored with 1 and 2 respectively, and 6 is colored with 2, we need to color 12 with a different color. Let's color 12 with 3.\n- Now, let's revisit the vertices that are connected to already colored vertices and assign colors accordingly.\n\n## Step 5: Continue Assigning Colors\n- Vertex 0: Color 1\n- Vertex 1: Color 1, Vertex 11: Color 2\n- Vertex 2: Color 1, Vertex 8: Color 2\n- Vertex 3: Connected to 10, 12 (color 3), and 13. Color 3 with 1 (since it's not connected to 0, 1, 2 directly), then 10 and 13 should be colored differently than 3. So, 10 could be 2, and 13 could be 2 as well, but they are connected to each other, so one of them needs a different color. Let's color 10 with 2 and 13 with 3 (or vice versa, but we need to check the connections).\n- Vertex 4: Color 1, Vertex 6: Color 2\n- Vertex 5: Connected to 10 (color 2) and 13 (let's say color 3 if 13 is colored with 3).

This is a classic graph coloring problem.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given graph:\n\n- Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]\n- Edges: [(0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 12), (1, 11), (2, 8), (3, 10), (3, 12), (3, 13), (4, 6), (5, 10), (5, 13), (6, 12), (7, 12)]\n- Possible colors: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure\nThe graph has 14 vertices and 13 edges. To color the graph, we should first identify any isolated vertices or subgraphs.\n\n## Step 2: Identify Isolated Vertices or Subgraphs\nLet's list the edges and identify the neighbors of each vertex:\n- 0: 7, 9, 12\n- 1: 11\n- 2: 8\n- 3: 10, 12, 13\n- 4: 6\n- 5: 10, 13\n- 6: 4, 12\n- 7: 0, 12\n- 8: 2\n- 9: 0\n- 10: 3, 5\n- 11: 1\n- 12: 0, 3, 6, 7\n- 13: 3, 5\n\n## Step 3: Color the Vertices\nWe will start coloring the vertices using the available colors (1, 2, 3, 4) and ensure that adjacent vertices do not have the same color. We can start with vertex 0 and proceed systematically.\n\n## Step 4: Assign Colors\nLet's start assigning colors to the vertices:\n- Vertex 0 is connected to 7, 9, and 12. Let's color 0 with color 1.\n- Vertex 1 is connected to 11. Color 1 with color 1, and 11 with color 2.\n- Vertex 2 is connected to 8. Color 2 with color 1, and 8 with color 2.\n- Vertex 3 is connected to 10, 12, and 13. Since 12 is connected to 0 (color 1), and 0 is already colored with 1, we need to color 12 differently. Let's come back to this after coloring other vertices.\n- Vertex 4 is connected to 6. Color 4 with color 1, and 6 with color 2.\n- Vertex 5 is connected to 10 and 13. We'll come back to this.\n- Vertex 7 is connected to 0 and 12. Since 0 is colored with 1, color 7 with 2.\n- Vertex 9 is connected to 0. Color 9 with 2 (since 0 is colored with 1).\n- Vertex 10 is connected to 3 and 5. We'll come back to this.\n- Vertex 12 is connected to 0, 3, 6, and 7. Since 0 and 7 are colored with 1 and 2 respectively, and 6 is colored with 2, we need to color 12 with a different color. Let's color 12 with 3.\n- Now, let's revisit the vertices that are connected to already colored vertices and assign colors accordingly.\n\n## Step 5: Continue Assigning Colors\n- Vertex 0: Color 1\n- Vertex 1: Color 1, Vertex 11: Color 2\n- Vertex 2: Color 1, Vertex 8: Color 2\n- Vertex 3: Connected to 10, 12 (color 3), and 13. Color 3 with 1 (since it's not connected to 0, 1, 2 directly), then 10 and 13 should be colored differently than 3. So, 10 could be 2, and 13 could be 2 as well, but they are connected to each other, so one of them needs a different color. Let's color 10 with 2 and 13 with 3 (or vice versa, but we need to check the connections).\n- Vertex 4: Color 1, Vertex 6: Color 2\n- Vertex 5: Connected to 10 (color 2) and 13 (let's say color 3 if 13 is colored with 3). So, 5 could be colored with 1.\n- Vertex 7: Color 2 (since it's connected to 0 with color 1 and 12 with color 3)\n- Vertex 9: Color 2\n- Vertex 10: Color 2 (connected to 3 with color 1 and 5 with color 1)\n- Vertex 12: Color 3\n- Vertex 3: Color 1\n- Vertex 5: Color 1\n- Vertex 6: Color 2\n- Vertex 7: Color 2\n- Vertex 13: Color 2 (but it's connected to 5 and 3, and 10 is colored with 2. So, it should be colored differently than 2 and 1. Thus, color 3 or 4. Since 3 is available and used by 12, let's color 13 with 3 or 4. Given 10 is 2 and 3 is 1, and 5 is 1, 13 can be 3.\n\nLet's finalize:\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 2\n- 7: 2\n- 8: 2\n- 9: 2\n- 10: 2\n- 11: 2\n- 12: 3 (or another color that doesn't conflict with its neighbors)\n- 13: 3 (since it's connected to 3 and 5, both colored with 1, and 10 colored with 2)\n\nLet's directly assign and adjust:\n- 0: 1, 7: 2, 9: 2, 12: 3\n- 1: 1, 11: 2\n- 2: 1, 8: 2\n- 3: 1, 10: 2, 13: 3 (or 4, but let's check)\n- 4: 1, 6: 2\n- 5: 1\n- Checking: 12 is connected to 0 (1), 7 (2), 6 (2), and 3 (1), so it's correctly colored with 3.\n- 10 is connected to 3 (1) and 5 (1), so it should be colored differently.

We have 15 vertices (0 through 14) and 13 edges connecting them. The edges are: [(0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 12), (1, 14), (2, 11), (2, 12), (2, 13), (4, 10), (5, 11), (6, 7), (7, 11), (8, 13), (10, 14)].\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Maximum Degree of the Graph\nTo determine the minimum number of colors needed, we should identify the maximum degree of the graph.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to color the given graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is a classic graph coloring problem.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the given graph. We have 14 vertices (0 to 13) and a list of edges connecting these vertices. The task is to assign colors to these vertices from the given set of colors [1, 2, 3, 4] such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Maximum Degree of the Graph\nTo determine the minimum number of colors required, we should identify the maximum degree of the graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident on it. By examining the edges, we can calculate the degree of each vertex.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the Degree of Each Vertex\nLet's calculate the degree of each vertex:\n- Vertex 0: 1 edge (0, 12)\n- Vertex 1: 2 edges (1, 8), (1, 13)\n- Vertex 2: 2 edges (2, 7), (2, 13)\n- Vertex 3: 1 edge (3, 5)\n- Vertex 4: 1 edge (4, 5)\n- Vertex 5: 4 edges (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 9), (5, 11)\n- Vertex 6: 1 edge (6, 11)\n- Vertex 7: 3 edges (2, 7), (7, 8), (7, 10)\n- Vertex 8: 3 edges (1, 8), (7, 8), (8, 11)\n- Vertex 9: 3 edges (5, 9), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13)\n- Vertex 10: 1 edge (7, 10)\n- Vertex 11: 4 edges (5, 11), (6, 11), (8, 11), (9, 11)\n- Vertex 12: 2 edges (0, 12), (9, 12)\n- Vertex 13: 3 edges (1, 13), (2, 13), (9, 13)\n\n## Step 4: Determine the Maximum Degree\nFrom Step 3, the maximum degree is 4, which is observed in vertices 5 and 11.

Vertex 11 (degree 4): Color 2 (since it's connected to Vertex 5)\n3.

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to assign colors to the vertices of the given graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is a classic graph coloring problem.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the given graph. We have 16 vertices (0 to 15) and a list of edges connecting these vertices. The edges are: [(0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 11), (2, 8), (2, 10), (4, 11), (5, 7), (6, 12), (7, 8), (8, 11), (9, 11)]. We need to visualize or analyze the connections between vertices.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Maximum Degree of the Graph\nTo determine the minimum number of colors needed, we should identify the maximum degree of any vertex in the graph. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the Degree of Each Vertex\nLet's calculate the degree of each vertex:\n- Vertex 0: 2 (connected to 4, 6)\n- Vertex 1: 1 (connected to 11)\n- Vertex 2: 2 (connected to 8, 10)\n- Vertex 3: 0 (no connections)\n- Vertex 4: 2 (connected to 0, 11)\n- Vertex 5: 1 (connected to 7)\n- Vertex 6: 2 (connected to 0, 12)\n- Vertex 7: 2 (connected to 5, 8)\n- Vertex 8: 3 (connected to 2, 7, 11)\n- Vertex 9: 1 (connected to 11)\n- Vertex 10: 1 (connected to 2)\n- Vertex 11: 4 (connected to 1, 4, 8, 9)\n- Vertex 12: 1 (connected to 6)\n- Vertex 13: 0 (no connections)\n- Vertex 14: 0 (no connections)\n- Vertex 15: 0 (no connections)\n\n## Step 4: Determine the Maximum Degree\nFrom Step 3, the maximum degree is 4 (Vertex 11). This means we might need up to 4 colors (since the chromatic number is less than or equal to the maximum degree + 1, according to Brooks' Theorem, and our graph is not a complete graph or an odd cycle).\n\n## Step 5: Apply a Coloring Algorithm\nWe'll use a simple greedy coloring algorithm. Start with an arbitrary vertex, assign it a color, and then iteratively assign colors to the remaining vertices, ensuring that no vertex is assigned the same color as its neighbors.\n\n## Step 6: Start Coloring Vertices\nLet's start coloring:\n- Vertex 0: Color 1\n- Vertex 1: Color 1\n- Vertex 2: Color 1\n- Vertex 3: Color 1 (since it's not connected to any other vertex)\n- Vertex 4: Since it's connected to 0, it gets Color 2\n- Vertex 5: Color 1\n- Vertex 6: Since it's connected to 0, it gets Color 2\n- Vertex 7: Since it's connected to 5, it gets Color 2\n- Vertex 8: Connected to 2 and 7, so it needs a different color from 1 and 2. It gets Color 3.\n- Vertex 9: Connected to 11, we'll come back to it.\n- Vertex 10: Connected to 2, so it gets Color 2.\n- Vertex 11: Connected to 1, 4, 8, 9. It needs a color different from their colors. Let's analyze: 1 is Color 1, 4 is Color 2, 8 is Color 3, and 9 is not yet colored. So, 11 can be Color 4 if needed, but first, we need to color 9.\n- Vertex 12: Connected to 6, so it gets Color 1 (since 6 is Color 2).\n\nLet's continue this process for all vertices, adjusting as necessary.\n\n## Step 7: Detailed Coloring\n- Vertex 0: 1\n- Vertex 1: 1\n- Vertex 2: 1\n- Vertex 3: 1\n- Vertex 4: 2\n- Vertex 5: 1\n- Vertex 6: 2\n- Vertex 7: 2\n- Vertex 8: 3\n- Vertex 9: Since 9 is connected to 11, and 11 is connected to 1 (Color 1), 4 (Color 2), and 8 (Color 3), let's color 11 and 9 appropriately. 11 is connected to 1 (1), 4 (2), 8 (3), and 9. So, 9 can be 4 if 11 is not 4. Let's color 11: it can't be 1, 2, or 3, so it is 4. Thus, 9 can be 1 (since 1 is not used by its neighbors).\n- Vertex 10: 2\n- Vertex 11: 4\n- Vertex 12: 1\n- Vertex 13: 1\n- Vertex 14: 1\n- Vertex 15: 1\n\nLet's finalize the coloring based on the greedy approach and adjust for any conflicts.\n\n## Step 8: Adjust Coloring as Necessary\nUpon detailed examination:\n- \"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 1 (since 11 will be 4), \"10\": 2, \"11\": 4, \"12\": 1, \"13\": 1, \"14\": 1, \"15\": 1\n\nLet's verify:\n- Vertex 0 (1): Neighbors 4 (2), 6 (2) - Okay\n- Vertex 1 (1): Neighbor 11 (4) - Okay\n- Vertex 2 (1): Neighbors 8 (3), 10 (2) - Okay\n- Vertex 3 (1): No neighbors - Okay\n- Vertex 4 (2): Neighbors 0 (1), 11 (4) - Okay\n- Vertex 5 (1): Neighbor 7 (2) - Okay\n- Vertex 6 (2): Neighbors 0 (1), 12 (1) - Not Okay, 12 should be different from 6, so 12 = 3 or 4. Let's adjust: \"12\": 3\n- Vertex 7 (2): Neighbors 5 (1), 8 (3) - Okay\n- Vertex 8 (3): Neighbors 2 (1), 7 (2), 11 (4) - Okay\n- Vertex 9 (1): Neighbor 11 (4) - Okay\n- Vertex 10 (2): Neighbor 2 (1) - Okay\n- Vertex 11 (4): Neighbors 1 (1), 4 (2), 8 (3), 9 (1) - Okay\n- Vertex 12 (3): Neighbor 6 (2) - Okay (after adjustment)\n- Vertex 13, 14, 15 (1): No neighbors or okay with their color.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 1, \"10\": 2, \"11\": 4, \"12\": 3, \"13\": 1, \"14\": 1, \"15\": 1}</answer>",

The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the Degree of Each Vertex\nLet's calculate the degree of each vertex:\n- Vertex 0: 2 (connected to 4, 6)\n- Vertex 1: 1 (connected to 11)\n- Vertex 2: 2 (connected to 8, 10)\n- Vertex 3: 0 (no connections)\n- Vertex 4: 2 (connected to 0, 11)\n- Vertex 5: 1 (connected to 7)\n- Vertex 6: 2 (connected to 0, 12)\n- Vertex 7: 2 (connected to 5, 8)\n- Vertex 8: 3 (connected to 2, 7, 11)\n- Vertex 9: 1 (connected to 11)\n- Vertex 10: 1 (connected to 2)\n- Vertex 11: 4 (connected to 1, 4, 8, 9)\n- Vertex 12: 1 (connected to 6)\n- Vertex 13: 0 (no connections)\n- Vertex 14: 0 (no connections)\n- Vertex 15: 0 (no connections)\n\n## Step 4: Determine the Maximum Degree\nFrom Step 3, the maximum degree is 4 (Vertex 11). This means we might need up to 4 colors (since the chromatic number is less than or equal to the maximum degree + 1, according to Brooks' Theorem, and our graph is not a complete graph or an odd cycle).\n\n## Step 5: Apply a Coloring Algorithm\nWe'll use a simple greedy coloring algorithm. Start with an arbitrary vertex, assign it a color, and then iteratively assign colors to the remaining vertices, ensuring that no vertex is assigned the same color as its neighbors.\n\n## Step 6: Start Coloring Vertices\nLet's start coloring:\n- Vertex 0: Color 1\n- Vertex 1: Color 1\n- Vertex 2: Color 1\n- Vertex 3: Color 1 (since it's not connected to any other vertex)\n- Vertex 4: Since it's connected to 0, it gets Color 2\n- Vertex 5: Color 1\n- Vertex 6: Since it's connected to 0, it gets Color 2\n- Vertex 7: Since it's connected to 5, it gets Color 2\n- Vertex 8: Connected to 2 and 7, so it needs a different color from 1 and 2. It gets Color 3.\n- Vertex 9: Connected to 11, we'll come back to it.\n- Vertex 10: Connected to 2, so it gets Color 2.\n- Vertex 11: Connected to 1, 4, 8, 9. It needs a color different from their colors. Let's analyze: 1 is Color 1, 4 is Color 2, 8 is Color 3, and 9 is not yet colored. So, 11 can be Color 4 if needed, but first, we need to color 9.\n- Vertex 12: Connected to 6, so it gets Color 1 (since 6 is Color 2).\n\nLet's continue this process for all vertices, adjusting as necessary.\n\n## Step 7: Detailed Coloring\n- Vertex 0: 1\n- Vertex 1: 1\n- Vertex 2: 1\n- Vertex 3: 1\n- Vertex 4: 2\n- Vertex 5: 1\n- Vertex 6: 2\n- Vertex 7: 2\n- Vertex 8: 3\n- Vertex 9: Since 9 is connected to 11, and 11 is connected to 1 (Color 1), 4 (Color 2), and 8 (Color 3), let's color 11 and 9 appropriately. 11 is connected to 1 (1), 4 (2), 8 (3), and 9. So, 9 can be 4 if 11 is not 4. Let's color 11: it can't be 1, 2, or 3, so it is 4. Thus, 9 can be 1 (since 1 is not used by its neighbors).\n- Vertex 10: 2\n- Vertex 11: 4\n- Vertex 12: 1\n- Vertex 13: 1\n- Vertex 14: 1\n- Vertex 15: 1\n\nLet's finalize the coloring based on the greedy approach and adjust for any conflicts.\n\n## Step 8: Adjust Coloring as Necessary\nUpon detailed examination:\n- \"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 1 (since 11 will be 4), \"10\": 2, \"11\": 4, \"12\": 1, \"13\": 1, \"14\": 1, \"15\": 1\n\nLet's verify:\n- Vertex 0 (1): Neighbors 4 (2), 6 (2) - Okay\n- Vertex 1 (1): Neighbor 11 (4) - Okay\n- Vertex 2 (1): Neighbors 8 (3), 10 (2) - Okay\n- Vertex 3 (1): No neighbors - Okay\n- Vertex 4 (2): Neighbors 0 (1), 11 (4) - Okay\n- Vertex 5 (1): Neighbor 7 (2) - Okay\n- Vertex 6 (2): Neighbors 0 (1), 12 (1) - Not Okay, 12 should be different from 6, so 12 = 3 or 4. Let's adjust: \"12\": 3\n- Vertex 7 (2): Neighbors 5 (1), 8 (3) - Okay\n- Vertex 8 (3): Neighbors 2 (1), 7 (2), 11 (4) - Okay\n- Vertex 9 (1): Neighbor 11 (4) - Okay\n- Vertex 10 (2): Neighbor 2 (1) - Okay\n- Vertex 11 (4): Neighbors 1 (1), 4 (2), 8 (3), 9 (1) - Okay\n- Vertex 12 (3): Neighbor 6 (2) - Okay (after adjustment)\n- Vertex 13, 14, 15 (1): No neighbors or okay with their color.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 1, \"10\": 2, \"11\": 4, \"12\": 3, \"13\": 1, \"14\": 1, \"15\": 1}</answer>",

Vertex 3: Color 1\n2. Vertex 12: Color 2 (since it's connected to Vertex 1, and we'll get to Vertex 1)\n3. Vertex 1: Color 1 or 3 (since it's not connected to Vertex 3 directly but is connected to Vertex 11 and 12). Let's assign Color 3.\n4. Vertex 7: Not connected to Vertex 3 directly, but connected to Vertex 12. Let's assign Color 1.\n5. Vertex 11: Connected to Vertex 3 and Vertex 1. Let's assign Color 2 (since Vertex 3 is Color 1 and Vertex 1 is Color 3).\n6. Vertex 15: Connected to Vertex 3 and Vertex 0, and Vertex 8. Let's assign Color 2 (since Vertex 3 is Color 1).\n7. Vertex 16: Connected to Vertex 1, Vertex 7, and Vertex 11. Let's assign Color 2 (since Vertex 1 is Color 3, Vertex 7 is Color 1, and Vertex 11 is Color 2). Actually, this should be Color 4 because it's connected to Vertex 11 (Color 2) and needs to be different from Vertex 1 (Color 3) and Vertex 7 (Color 1).\n8. Continue this process for all vertices.\n\nAfter detailed inspection and trial, a valid coloring is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"0\": 1,\n  \"1\": 3,\n  \"2\": 1,\n  \"3\": 1,\n  \"4\": 2,\n  \"5\": 2,\n  \"6\": 1,\n  \"7\": 1,\n  \"8\": 1,\n  \"9\": 2,\n  \"10\": 2,\n  \"11\": 2,\n  \"12\": 2,\n  \"13\": 3,\n  \"14\": 1,\n  \"15\": 2,\n  \"16\": 4\n}\n```\n\nLet's verify if this coloring satisfies the condition.\n\nUpon verification, it appears that the provided coloring is a valid solution.\n\n<answer>{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 3, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2, \"10\": 2, \"11\": 2, \"12\": 2, \"13\": 3, \"14\": 1, \"15\": 2, \"16\": 4}</answer>",
