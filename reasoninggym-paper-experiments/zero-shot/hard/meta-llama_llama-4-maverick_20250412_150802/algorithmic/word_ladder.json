'KIR' is a valid word, it's a French cocktail made from cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) and white wine.\n\n1. Start with 'KIR'. To get closer to 'NAG', let's change 'K' to 'F' or other letters that could lead us to 'NAG' in subsequent steps. However, 'KIR' to a valid word that is closer to 'NAG' is needed.\n\n'KIR' -> 'FIR' (valid word)\n\n2. Now we have 'FIR'. Let's change it to a word that is closer to 'NAG'. Changing 'F' to 'FAR' is not a one-step process, but 'FIR' to 'FIR' is not a change. Let's directly think of changing 'FIR' to a valid word.\n\n'FIR' -> 'FIR' is not a change, so let's directly change 'KIR' to another valid word that can lead us to 'NAG'. 'KIR' to 'KIN' is a valid change.\n\n'KIR' -> 'KIN' (valid word)\n\n3. From 'KIN', we can think of changing to 'KIG' or other combinations, but 'KIG' is not a valid word in English. Let's directly think of a valid sequence.\n\n'KIN' -> 'PIN' (valid word)\n\n4. Now 'PIN'. Let's change 'P' to 'PAG' or another letter that can lead us to 'NAG'.\n\n'PIN' -> 'PAN' (valid word)\n\n5. Now 'PAN'. Let's change it to 'NAN' or directly to 'NAG'.\n\n'PAN' -> 'NAN' (valid word)\n\n6. Now 'NAN'. Let's change it to 'NAG'.\n\n'NAN' -> 'NAG' (valid word)\n\nSo, the sequence is: KIR,KIN,PIN,PAN,NAN,NAG\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>KIR,KIN,PIN,PAN,NAN,NAG</answer> \nThus, \nKIR,KIN,PIN,PAN,NAN,NAG",
