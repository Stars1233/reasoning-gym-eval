Rectangles are outlined with '#' and overlapping rectangles are shown with '\u2588'.\n\n\n## Step 2\nWe need to identify the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle. The top-left corner is where we first encounter a '#' or '\u2588' that could be the start of a rectangle, and the bottom-right corner is where the rectangle ends.\n\n\n## Step 3\nUpon examining the grid, we notice two distinct rectangles. The first one is a large rectangle that spans from the top line with \"###\" to the line before \"##########################\u2588#\u2588\". The second rectangle is the large one outlined by \"##########################\u2588#\u2588\" and \"#############################\".\n\n\n## Step 4\nLet's count the rectangles. There's a small rectangle at the top with \"###\" (1 rectangle), and a larger rectangle outlined by \"##########################\u2588#\u2588\" and \"#############################\" (1 rectangle). There are no other complete rectangles.\n\n\n## Step 5\nAdditionally, we need to consider if there are any overlapping rectangles represented by '\u2588'. Upon closer inspection, it appears that the '\u2588' symbols indicate an overlap between the large rectangle and another rectangle or an extension of it.\n\n\n## Step 6\nAfter carefully examining the grid, we can see that there are indeed 2 rectangles: one small rectangle at the top and one large rectangle.\n\n\n## Step 7\nCount the total number of rectangles.

A large rectangle outlined with '#' on the right side, which is not overlapping with any other rectangle as per the given grid representation.\n2. A smaller rectangle or a column-like structure represented by '###' at the top and bottom and '# #' in between, on the left side relative to the larger rectangle.\n\n\n## Step 4: Count the Rectangles\nUpon closer inspection:\n- The structure on the left (relative to the larger rectangle) is a single rectangle because it has a clear top ('###'), bottom ('###'), and sides ('# #').\n- The larger structure on the right is also a single rectangle as it has a clear outline with '#'.\nThus, there are two distinct rectangles visible.\n\n\n## Step 5: Provide the Final Count\nCount the total number of rectangles identified.\n\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",
