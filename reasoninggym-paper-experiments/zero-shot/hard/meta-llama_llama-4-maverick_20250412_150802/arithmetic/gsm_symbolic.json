So, to write 144 pages, it takes him 144 * 15 = 2160 minutes.\n\n## Step 6: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.\nTo convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.

Monday and Tuesday: 3 hours each = 6 hours total. Wednesday: x episodes of 25 minutes = x * (25/60) hours. Thursday: 3 hours + 55 minutes = 3 + (55/60) hours = 3 + 0.9167 hours = 3.9167 hours.

Thursday: 3.9167 hours. Friday: 10 hours. So, the total time for these days is 6 + 3.9167 + 10 = 19.9167 hours.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the time spent watching TV on Wednesday\nThe total TV watching time for the week is given as 22.416666666666664 hours.

Each episode on Wednesday is 25 minutes, so the number of episodes watched is 150 / 25 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>6</answer>",

So, the total number of potted plants she had on the window ledges is 11 * 55 = 605.\n3. The total number of potted plants she has before giving any away is 45 (new) + 605 (already had) = 650.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many potted plants she will give away.\n\n1. She will give 5 potted plants from each of the 55 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is 5 * 55 = 275.\n\nNow, we subtract the number of potted plants she will give away from the total number she had before giving any away.\n\n1. Total potted plants remaining = 650 - 275 = 375.\n\n<answer>375</answer>",

For a hat, 8 skeins are needed. A pair of booties requires 4 skeins, and a pair of gloves requires 6 skeins.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of skeins required for one set of winter wear.\nTo find the total for one set, we need to add the skeins required for each item: 15 (shawl) + 6 (sweater) + 8 (hat) + 4 (booties) + 6 (gloves) = 39 skeins.\n\n## Step 3: Since Susan has 4 grandchildren and they are all the same size, we need to multiply the total skeins required for one set by 4.\nTotal skeins for 4 sets = 39 skeins/set * 4 sets = 156 skeins.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>156</answer>",
