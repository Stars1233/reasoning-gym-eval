We start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, 2. 3708 = 2 * 1854. Continuing, 1854 = 2 * 927. Then, 927 = 3 * 309. Further, 309 = 3 * 103. So, 3708 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 103.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize 9465 into its prime factors.\nNow, let's break down 9465. Starting with 3 (since 9465 is divisible by 3), 9465 = 3 * 3155. Then, 3155 = 5 * 631. So, 9465 = 3 * 5 * 631.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 7108 into its prime factors.\nBreaking down 7108, we start with 2. 7108 = 2 * 3554. Continuing, 3554 = 2 * 1777. Then, 1777 = 1777 (since 1777 is a prime number). So, 7108 = 2^2 * 1777.\n\n## Step 4: Identify common prime factors among the numbers.\nComparing the prime factorizations:\n- 3708 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 103\n- 9465 = 3 * 5 * 631\n- 7108 = 2^2 * 1777\nThe common prime factor is not immediately obvious across all three numbers since they don't share the same prime factors. However, we notice that 3708 and 7108 share 2^2, and 3708 and 9465 share 3.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the GCD.\nTo find the GCD of the three numbers, we look for common factors. The only common prime factor between any two numbers is 2 (between 3708 and 7108) and 3 (between 3708 and 9465), but there's no common prime factor among all three. Thus, the GCD will be 1 since there are no prime factors common to all three numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>1</answer>",

Further breaking down 2749 yields no simple factors, so we check if it's prime. 2749 is a product of 13 and 211 (2749 = 13 * 211), so 5498 = 2 * 13 * 211.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize 9135 into its prime factors.\n9135 = 3 * 3045 = 3 * 3 * 1015 = 3 * 3 * 5 * 203 = 3 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 29, so 9135 = 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 29.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 6696 into its prime factors.\n6696 = 2 * 3348 = 2 * 2 * 1674 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 837 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 279 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 93 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 31, so 6696 = 2^3 * 3^3 * 31.\n\n## Step 4: Factorize 8958 into its prime factors.\n8958 = 2 * 4479 = 2 * 3 * 1493. Further, 1493 is a prime number, so 8958 = 2 * 3 * 1493.\n\n## Step 5: Identify common prime factors among the numbers.\nComparing the prime factorizations:\n- 5498 = 2 * 13 * 211\n- 9135 = 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 29\n- 6696 = 2^3 * 3^3 * 31\n- 8958 = 2 * 3 * 1493\nThe only common prime factor is 1 since there's no prime number common to all four.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the GCD.\nSince there are no common prime factors among all four numbers except for 1, the GCD is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>1</answer>",

We start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, 2, but since 3735 is odd, we move to 3. 3735 \u00f7 3 = 1245. Continuing, 1245 \u00f7 3 = 415. Then, 415 \u00f7 5 = 83. So, 3735 = 3^2 * 5 * 83.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize 5270 into its prime factors.\nNext, we break down 5270. Starting with 2, 5270 \u00f7 2 = 2635. Then, 2635 \u00f7 5 = 527. 527 is a product of 17 and 31 since 527 \u00f7 17 = 31. So, 5270 = 2 * 5 * 17 * 31.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 3565 into its prime factors.\nNow, we break down 3565. It is odd, so we start with 3, but it's not divisible by 3. Moving to 5, 3565 \u00f7 5 = 713. Then, 713 = 23 * 31. So, 3565 = 5 * 23 * 31.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the common prime factors among the three numbers.\nFrom the prime factorizations:\n- 3735 = 3^2 * 5 * 83\n- 5270 = 2 * 5 * 17 * 31\n- 3565 = 5 * 23 * 31\nThe only common prime factor is 5.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the GCD.\nSince 5 is the only prime factor common to all three numbers, the GCD is 5.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>5</answer>",

Let's start by dividing it by the smallest prime numbers and continue until we cannot divide anymore. 3831 = 3 * 1277. Further breaking down 1277, we find that 1277 = 1277 (it's a prime number).

First, we divide 9162 by 1276: $9162 = 7 \\times 1276 + 230$. Then, we divide 1276 by 230: $1276 = 5 \\times 230 + 126$. Next, $230 = 1 \\times 126 + 104$. Continuing, $126 = 1 \\times 104 + 22$, $104 = 4 \\times 22 + 16$, $22 = 1 \\times 16 + 6$, $16 = 2 \\times 6 + 4$, $6 = 1 \\times 4 + 2$, $4 = 2 \\times 2 + 0$. So, the GCD of 1276 and 9162 is 2.\n\n## Step 2: Find the GCD of the result (2) and 7076\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm again: $7076 = 3538 \\times 2 + 0$. Since 7076 is divisible by 2, the GCD of 2 and 7076 is 2.\n\n## Step 3: Find the GCD of the result (2) and 6002\nAgain, using the Euclidean algorithm: $6002 = 3001 \\times 2 + 0$. Since 6002 is also divisible by 2, the GCD of 2 and 6002 is 2.\n\n## Step 4: Conclusion\nSince the GCD of 1276 and 9162 is 2, and 2 is also the GCD of 2 with both 7076 and 6002, the GCD of all four numbers is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>2</answer>",
