Move the player to the box at (4,4) and push it towards (3,4), then continue to (3,5) until it's on the goal at (3,6) or a suitable position to be pushed to a goal.\n     2.

Let's analyze the given puzzle and come up with a step-by-step solution.\n\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Puzzle Layout\nThe given puzzle is represented as a grid with various symbols:\n- `+` represents walls,\n- `-` represents empty positions,\n- `@` represents boxes,\n- `X` represents goals,\n- `*` represents the player,\n- `%` represents the player on a goal (not present initially),\n- `$` represents a box on a goal (not present initially).\n\n## Step 2: Identify Initial Positions\nIdentify the initial positions of the player and the boxes.\n- The player is at the bottom, near the center (`+ + - - - - - * - +`).\n- Boxes are at (`+ - @ X +`), (`+ - - - + + + + + @`), and (`+ - - @ - X - - - +`), (`+ - - - - - @ - X - +`).\n\n## Step 3: Plan the Moves\nTo solve the puzzle, we need to move the boxes to the goals. The goals are marked with `X`. Let's list the boxes and goals:\n- Boxes are at (2,3), (6,7), (8,3), and (9,7) if we consider the top-left corner as (1,1).\n- Goals are at (2,4), (8,7), (9,3), and (10,6).\n\n## Step 4: Execute the Plan\nLet's start by moving the player towards the boxes and then pushing them towards the goals. The player starts at (11,8).\n\n1. Move the player to (6,7) to push the box to (8,7).\n2. Move the player to (8,3) to push the box to (9,3).\n3. Move the player to (2,3) to push the box to (2,4).\n4. Move the player to (9,7) to push the box to (10,6).\n\nLet's break it down into actual moves.\n\n## Step 5: Detailed Moves\n1. The player is at (11,8). Move up and left to reach the box at (6,7).\n   - Move: UUUULLL (to reach (8,7) and then adjust to push the box)\n2. Push the box at (6,7) to (8,7).\n   - Move: ULLL (to be at (7,7)), then U (to be at (6,7)), then L (to push the box to (8,7) but first, we need to be at (7,7)), so the actual sequence involves navigating to the box and then pushing it.\n3. Adjust the steps for actual movement:\n   - The player moves from (11,8) to (6,7): UUUULLLD (to be at (7,7)), then U (to be at (6,7)), then L (push the box), so it's UUUULLLDU.\n   - After pushing the first box, navigate to the next box.\n\nLet's directly plan the optimal moves:\n1. Move to the box at (8,3): UUUURRRDDLL.\n2. Push it to (9,3): U, then R.\n3. Move to the box at (2,3): LLLLUUU.\n4. Push it to (2,4): U, then R.\n5. Move to the box at (9,7): DDDDRRR.\n6. Push it to (10,6): D, then L.\n\n## Step 6: Combine the Moves\nLet's directly calculate the moves:\n1. Initial position (11,8) to (8,3): UUUURRRDDLL.\n2. Push (8,3) to (9,3): UR.\n3. Move to (2,3): LLLLUUU.\n4. Push (2,3) to (2,4): UR.\n5. Move to (9,7): DDDDRRR.\n6.

Move the player to `(5, 2)` and push the box to `(3, 2)`, which is a goal.\n2. Move the player to `(2, 2)` and push it towards `(1, 2)` and then to `(1, 3)` if possible, but we need to get it to `(1, 4)`.\n3. Adjust the plan: Move the player to `(1, 2)`, push it to `(1, 3)`, and then to `(1, 4)`, which is a goal.\n4. The box at `(5, 11)` is already on a goal.\n\n**Detailed Moves:**\n\n1. The player starts at `(7, 7)`. Move up to `(5, 7)`, then left to `(5, 2)`. Push the box at `(5, 2)` down to `(6, 2)`, then to `(3, 2)`.\n   - Moves: `UUUUULLLLLDDDR` (to push the box at `(5, 2)` to `(3, 2)`).\n2. Move the player to `(2, 2)` and push the box towards `(1, 2)` and then to `(1, 4)`.\n   - Moves: `UUUULLDDRRUR` (to push the box at `(2, 2)` to `(1, 4)`).\n\nLet's simplify and directly provide the sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe final sequence after detailed step-by-step planning and adjustments is represented as a string.\n\n<answer>UUUUULLLLLDDDRUUUUULLDDRRURULLUURRDDDD</answer>",

Move the player to `(5, 2)` and push the box to `(3, 2)`, which is a goal.\n2. Move the player to `(2, 2)` and push it towards `(1, 2)` and then to `(1, 3)` if possible, but we need to get it to `(1, 4)`.\n3. Adjust the plan: Move the player to `(1, 2)`, push it to `(1, 3)`, and then to `(1, 4)`, which is a goal.\n4. The box at `(5, 11)` is already on a goal.\n\n**Detailed Moves:**\n\n1. The player starts at `(7, 7)`. Move up to `(5, 7)`, then left to `(5, 2)`. Push the box at `(5, 2)` down to `(6, 2)`, then to `(3, 2)`.\n   - Moves: `UUUUULLLLLDDDR` (to push the box at `(5, 2)` to `(3, 2)`).\n2. Move the player to `(2, 2)` and push the box towards `(1, 2)` and then to `(1, 4)`.\n   - Moves: `UUUULLDDRRUR` (to push the box at `(2, 2)` to `(1, 4)`).\n\nLet's simplify and directly provide the sequence of moves that solves the puzzle.\n\nThe final sequence after detailed step-by-step planning and adjustments is represented as a string.\n\n<answer>UUUUULLLLLDDDRUUUUULLDDRRURULLUURRDDDD</answer>",

The task is to move the boxes (`@`) to the goals (`X`) using the player (`*`), and the solution should be a sequence of movements represented by the characters `L` (left), `R` (right), `U` (up), and `D` (down).\n\nLet's analyze the initial state:\n- The player is at the position `(7, 3)` (0-indexed, considering the top-left corner as `(0,0)`).\n- There are three boxes at positions `(2, 3)`, `(6, 4)`, and `(7, 4)`.\n- There are three goals at positions `(3, 2)`, `(5, 4)`, and `(7, 7)` and `(7, 9)`.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the initial positions and the goal of the puzzle.\nThe player is at `(7, 3)`, boxes are at `(2, 3)`, `(6, 4)`, and `(7, 4)`, and goals are at `(3, 2)`, `(5, 4)`, `(7, 7)`, and `(7, 9)`.\n\n## Step 2: Plan the movement to push the boxes to the goals.\nFirst, let's move the player to the nearest box and start pushing them towards the goals.\n\n## Step 3: Execute the plan step-by-step.\n1. Move the player to `(6, 4)` or `(7, 4)` to start pushing the boxes.\n2. The closest box is at `(7, 4)`, so let's move the player there and push it towards `(7, 7)`, which is a goal.\n\n## Step 4: Detailed movement.\n1. The player is at `(7, 3)`. Move right to `(7, 4)` to be adjacent to one of the boxes. (`R`)\n2. Push the box at `(7, 4)` to `(7, 5)`. (`R`)\n3. Continue this process to move the box to `(7, 7)`, which is a goal.

Move the player to `(6, 4)` and push it towards `(5, 4)`, which is a goal.\n\n## Step 6: Execute the detailed movements.\n1. `R` to `(7, 4)`, `R` to push the box to `(7, 5)`, `R` again to `(7, 6)`, and `R` to push it to `(7, 7)`. So, `RRR`.\n2. Now, the player is at `(7, 6)`. Move `L` to `(7, 5)`, `L` to `(7, 4)`, `U` to `(6, 4)`, `U` to `(5, 4)` to push the box, and then `U` to push it to `(4, 4)`, but we need to adjust as the goal is at `(5, 4)`. So, we push it directly to the goal.\n3. The sequence so far is `RRR` (to push the first box to the goal), then `LLUU` to be at `(5, 4)` and push the box to the goal, which requires `U`.\n\n## Step 7: Adjust and simplify the plan.\nLet's directly simplify:\n1. The player moves `R` to `(7, 4)`, then `RRR` to push the box to `(7, 7)`.\n2. Then moves `LLL` to `(7, 4)`, `U` to `(6, 4)`, and pushes the box `U` to `(5, 4)`.\n3. Lastly, moves `L` to `(6, 3)`, `UUUU` to `(2, 3)`, and pushes the box to `(3, 3)`, then to `(3, 2)`.\n\nLet's directly calculate the steps:\n1. `RRR` to push the box at `(7, 4)` to `(7, 7)`.\n2. `LLLUU` to push the box at `(6, 4)` to `(5, 4)`.\n3. `LLUUUU` to reach `(2, 3)`, `L` to push it towards `(3, 2)`, resulting in `LDL`.\n\n## Step 8: Combine the steps.\nThe steps are `RRR`, `LLLUU`, `U` (to push), `LLUUUU`, `L`, `D`, `L`.\n\nLet's simplify the entire sequence:\n1. `RRR` = `RRR`\n2. `LLLUUU` = `LLL` (to `(7, 3)`), `U` (to `(6, 3)`), `U` (to `(5, 3)`), `U` (to `(4, 3)`), and then the box push `U`.\n3. `LLUUUU` = Move to `(2, 3)`, `L` to push towards the goal.\n\nThe final sequence after detailed step-by-step movement is calculated as: `RRRLLLUUUUULLUUUULDLLLDR`.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>RRRLLLUUUUULLUUUULDLLLDR</answer>",
