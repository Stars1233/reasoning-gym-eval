Let's analyze each statement: Statement 1 claims at least 7 statements are true, Statement 2 claims at most 2 statements are false, Statement 3 claims none are true, Statement 4 claims exactly 4 are false, Statement 5 claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is prime, and Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is composite.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then all statements must be false. However, this creates a paradox because if all statements are false, then Statement 3 cannot be true. Thus, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 3 being false on Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 is false, for Statement 5 to be true ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both'), Statement 4 must be true because Statement 5's condition requires one of them to be true and the other false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are false. This means 3 statements are true. The false statements would be Statement 3 (already determined to be false), and 3 other statements.\n\n## Step 5: Examine Statement 1 with Statement 4 being true\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 1 cannot be true because we know exactly 3 statements are true (since 4 are false). So, Statement 1 is one of the false statements.\n\n## Step 6: Examine Statement 2 with Statement 4 being true\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Since Statement 4 is true and indicates 4 false statements, Statement 2 must be false.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 6 and Statement 7 with 3 true statements\nWith 3 true statements, Statement 6 ('The number of true statements is a prime number.') is true because 3 is a prime number. Statement 7 ('The number of false statements is a composite number.') is also true because 4 is a composite number.\n\n## Step 8: Assess the consistency of the statements with the findings\nWe have Statement 4, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as true, and Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 5 as false. Let's verify: Statement 4 is true (3 true, 4 false), Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). Statement 1 is false (not at least 7 true), Statement 2 is false (more than 2 false), Statement 3 is false (not all false), and Statement 5 is false because it requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both; since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, this condition is met, but Statement 5 is claiming to be true while being false, which is a contradiction. However, our analysis already determined Statement 5 should be false because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, making Statement 5's statement about \"but not both\" technically true, which is a mistake in the initial reasoning regarding Statement 5's truth value based on Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate Statement 5 with the correct understanding\nGiven Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is actually true because it states \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both,\" and this condition is satisfied. So, the true statements are Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7, which means 4 statements are true and 3 are false.\n\n## Step 10: Check if the new distribution satisfies all true statements\nWith 4 true statements (Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7), Statement 4 is true (4 false statements, but we have 3 false), which is not satisfied. This indicates a potential inconsistency.\n\n## Step 11: Re-check the initial assumption and analyze other possible distributions\nLet's directly check the validity of the statements based on possible numbers of true statements and see if any configuration satisfies all given conditions.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the analysis by directly checking critical statements\nLet's directly analyze the statements: If Statement 3 is false, and assuming Statement 4 is true (meaning 4 false statements), we have a contradiction because it leads to 3 true statements. Let's examine other possibilities.\n\n## Step 13: Final analysis of possible solutions\nLet's directly check the number of true statements that could satisfy the given conditions. For 7 statements, possible numbers of true statements range from 0 to 7. We've established that Statement 3 is false. Let's directly evaluate the conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

We need to analyze each statement and its implications on the others.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means the number of true statements (T) is $T \\geq 5$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that all 7 statements are true, so $T = 7$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means $T = 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T = 3$ because if 4 out of 7 are false, 3 are true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' For Statement 5 to be true, either $T = 5$ (Statement 3 is true) or $T = 3$ (Statement 4 is true) must be true, but not both.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 for Statement 6 to be true.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The number of false statements is $7 - T$. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $7 - T = 4$ or $6$, meaning $T = 3$ or $1$.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the statements\n- If Statement 2 is true, then $T = 7$. This makes Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 6 true because 7 is prime. Statement 4 is false because $T \\neq 3$. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, so \"either or but not both\" is satisfied as both are false. Statement 7 is false because $7 - T = 0$, and 0 is not composite. So, we have $T = 7$, Statement 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 true, and Statement 4, 7 false. This gives us 5 true statements, which contradicts $T = 7$. Thus, $T = 7$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 10: Check the validity of $T = 5$ (Statement 3)\nIf $T = 5$, then Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because $7 - 5 = 2$, and 2 is not composite. So, we have Statement 1, 3, 5, 6 true, and Statement 2, 4, 7 false, giving us $T = 4$, which contradicts $T = 5$. Thus, $T = 5$ is not a valid solution under the given conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Check the validity of $T = 3$ (Statement 4)\nIf $T = 3$, Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is true. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because $7 - 3 = 4$, and 4 is composite. So, Statement 4, 5, 6, 7 are true, giving $T = 4$, which contradicts $T = 3$. Thus, $T = 3$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate other possible values of $T$ based on Statement 6\nFor $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false (because both Statement 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (because 2 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (because $7-2 = 5$ is not composite). So, $T = 1$, which contradicts $T = 2$. For $T = 7$, we've already seen it's not valid. For $T = 3$, it's also not valid as shown.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check for $T = 3$\nLet's directly check if $T = 3$ can be a solution by assigning truth values. For $T = 3$, possible true statements could be Statement 4, 6, and 7 because they can be true when $T = 3$. Statement 4 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true. This satisfies $T = 3$.\n\n## Step 14: Verify if $T = 3$ with Statement 4, 6, 7 being true satisfies all conditions\n- Statement 1 is false because $T < 5$.\n- Statement 2 is false because there are false statements.\n- Statement 3 is false because $T \\neq 5$.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are not \"either or but not both\" true; Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, so it's actually true, which is a contradiction.\nThis means our initial assumption that Statement 5 is false when $T = 3$ and Statement 4 is true needs reevaluation because Statement 5 being true would require either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both. Since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is actually true.\n\n## Step 15: Re-check the conditions for $T = 3$ with the correct understanding of Statement 5\nIf Statement 4, 5, 6, 7 are true, $T = 4$, which is not valid. Let's consider other combinations for $T = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

The number of false statements is $7 - T$. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.

Statement 2 is false because not all statements are true. Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because $7 - 5 = 2$, and 2 is not composite. So, we have Statement 1, 3, 5, 6 true, and Statement 2, 4, 7 false, giving us $T = 4$, which contradicts $T = 5$. Thus, $T = 5$ is not a valid solution under the given conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Check the validity of $T = 3$ (Statement 4)\nIf $T = 3$, Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is false.

Thus, $T = 3$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate other possible values of $T$ based on Statement 6\nFor $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false (because both Statement 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (because 2 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (because $7-2 = 5$ is not composite). So, $T = 1$, which contradicts $T = 2$. For $T = 7$, we've already seen it's not valid. For $T = 3$, it's also not valid as shown.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check for $T = 3$\nLet's directly check if $T = 3$ can be a solution by assigning truth values. For $T = 3$, possible true statements could be Statement 4, 6, and 7 because they can be true when $T = 3$. Statement 4 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true. This satisfies $T = 3$.\n\n## Step 14: Verify if $T = 3$ with Statement 4, 6, 7 being true satisfies all conditions\n- Statement 1 is false because $T < 5$.\n- Statement 2 is false because there are false statements.\n- Statement 3 is false because $T \\neq 5$.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are not \"either or but not both\" true; Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, so it's actually true, which is a contradiction.\nThis means our initial assumption that Statement 5 is false when $T = 3$ and Statement 4 is true needs reevaluation because Statement 5 being true would require either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both.

This means $T \\geq 2$, where $T$ is the number of true statements.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F \\leq 3$, where $F$ is the number of false statements. Since $T + F = 7$, it means $T \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means $T = 5$.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T = 5$ because $T + F = 7$.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 5$, this statement cannot be true because it demands that only one of them is true, but they are essentially saying the same thing.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' This means $T$ must be a prime number. The possible values for $T$ are 2, 3, 5, or 7 since $T$ cannot be greater than 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' This implies $F$ is composite. $F$ can be 4 or 6 since $F = 7 - T$ and $T$ cannot be 0 or 1 (from Statement 1), and $F$ cannot be 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent ($T = 5$), Statement 5 must be false because it asserts that exactly one of them is true.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the implications of Statement 5 being false\nWith Statement 5 being false, $F = 1$ (since there are 7 statements in total). This means we have 1 false statement and 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Check if $T = 6$ satisfies the other statements\n- Statement 1: $T = 6 \\geq 2$, so it's true.\n- Statement 2: $F = 1 \\leq 3$, so it's true.\n- Statement 3: $T = 6 \\neq 5$, so it's false.\n- Statement 4: $F = 1 \\neq 2$, so it's false.\n- Statement 5: We've established it's false.\n- Statement 6: $T = 6$ is not prime, so it's false.\n- Statement 7: $F = 1$ is not composite, so it's false.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the truthfulness of the statements when $T = 6$\nWe have $T = 6$ and $F = 1$. Statements 1 and 2 are true. Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are false. This gives us $F = 5$, which contradicts our initial assumption that $F = 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluate the statements for possible $T$\nLet's directly check the possible values of $T$ based on the constraints:\n- From Statement 2, $T \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 1 is satisfied if $T \\geq 2$, so it's automatically true for $T \\geq 4$.\n- For $T = 4$, Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime.\n- For $T = 5$, Statements 3 and 4 are true, and Statement 5 is false.\n- For $T = 7$, Statement 7 is false because $F = 0$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze $T = 5$ as a potential solution\nIf $T = 5$, then $F = 2$. Statements 3 and 4 are true. Statement 5 is false because both 3 and 4 are true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is true. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as true, and Statements 5 and 7 as false, which matches $T = 5$ and $F = 2$.\n\n## Step 8: Check other possible $T$ values\nFor $T = 4$, $F = 3$. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (because 3 is not composite). So, we have Statements 1, 2, and 5 as true, and the rest as false, giving $T = 3$, which does not match.\n\n## Step 9: Verify the solution for $T = 5$\nFor $T = 5$, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as true and 5, 7 as false.

This means $T \\geq 2$, where $T$ is the number of true statements.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F \\leq 3$, where $F$ is the number of false statements. Since $T + F = 7$, it means $T \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means $T = 5$.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $T = 5$ because $T + F = 7$.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 5$, this statement cannot be true because it demands that only one of them is true, but they are essentially saying the same thing.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' This means $T$ must be a prime number. The possible values for $T$ are 2, 3, 5, or 7 since $T$ cannot be greater than 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' This implies $F$ is composite. $F$ can be 4 or 6 since $F = 7 - T$ and $T$ cannot be 0 or 1 (from Statement 1), and $F$ cannot be 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent ($T = 5$), Statement 5 must be false because it asserts that exactly one of them is true.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the implications of Statement 5 being false\nWith Statement 5 being false, $F = 1$ (since there are 7 statements in total). This means we have 1 false statement and 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Check if $T = 6$ satisfies the other statements\n- Statement 1: $T = 6 \\geq 2$, so it's true.\n- Statement 2: $F = 1 \\leq 3$, so it's true.\n- Statement 3: $T = 6 \\neq 5$, so it's false.\n- Statement 4: $F = 1 \\neq 2$, so it's false.\n- Statement 5: We've established it's false.\n- Statement 6: $T = 6$ is not prime, so it's false.\n- Statement 7: $F = 1$ is not composite, so it's false.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the truthfulness of the statements when $T = 6$\nWe have $T = 6$ and $F = 1$. Statements 1 and 2 are true. Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are false. This gives us $F = 5$, which contradicts our initial assumption that $F = 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluate the statements for possible $T$\nLet's directly check the possible values of $T$ based on the constraints:\n- From Statement 2, $T \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 1 is satisfied if $T \\geq 2$, so it's automatically true for $T \\geq 4$.\n- For $T = 4$, Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime.\n- For $T = 5$, Statements 3 and 4 are true, and Statement 5 is false.\n- For $T = 7$, Statement 7 is false because $F = 0$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze $T = 5$ as a potential solution\nIf $T = 5$, then $F = 2$. Statements 3 and 4 are true. Statement 5 is false because both 3 and 4 are true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is true. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as true, and Statements 5 and 7 as false, which matches $T = 5$ and $F = 2$.\n\n## Step 8: Check other possible $T$ values\nFor $T = 4$, $F = 3$. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (because 3 is not composite). So, we have Statements 1, 2, and 5 as true, and the rest as false, giving $T = 3$, which does not match.\n\n## Step 9: Verify the solution for $T = 5$\nFor $T = 5$, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as true and 5, 7 as false. This gives $T = 5$, which is consistent.\n\n## Step 10: Count the number of possible solutions\nWe need to count how many configurations satisfy all given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This implies that the number of true statements is 6 or 7.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means the number of false statements is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, which simplifies to \"the number of true statements is 0 or more,\" but since there are 7 statements, it effectively means all statements can be false or any combination thereof, making it always true because it includes all possibilities.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states the number of true statements.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 5 statements are true.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that 5 statements are true, they are essentially saying the same thing, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false under the condition that they both state the same outcome regarding the number of true statements.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 since 0 is not considered composite.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5 for its implications\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' However, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 state that exactly 5 statements are true. Thus, Statement 5 is false because it demands that only one of them can be true, but they are equivalent in meaning.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements must be true. This means 6 or 7 statements are true. If 7 statements are true, then Statement 5 must be true, which is not possible since we've established it's false. So, if Statement 1 is true, exactly 6 statements must be true.\n\n## Step 4: Check the consistency of having 6 true statements\nIf 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. Statement 5 is false, so it counts as one of the false statements. Let's check the other statements:\n- Statement 1 is true because 6 out of 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 7 statements are false, and having 1 false satisfies this.\n- Statement 3 is false or true depending on the number of true statements. If 6 are true, it's false.\n- Statement 4 is false for the same reason as Statement 3; it claims 5 are true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, but this needs checking. 6 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 5: Detailed check for 6 true statements\nLet's verify if having 6 true statements is possible:\n- Statement 1: True (6 true statements)\n- Statement 2: True (1 false statement is within \"at most 7 false\")\n- Statement 3: False (not exactly 5 true)\n- Statement 4: False (not exactly 2 false, and it's equivalent to Statement 3)\n- Statement 5: False (as established)\n- Statement 6: False (6 is not prime)\n- Statement 7: True (1 is not composite, so this is actually false because it says the number of false statements is composite)\n\n## Step 6: Checking Statement 6 and Statement 7 for 6 true statements\nFor 6 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. So, we have at least two false statements (Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6), which contradicts our assumption of having only 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the possibility of 5 true statements as per Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true implies 5 true statements. Let's check:\n- If 5 statements are true, then Statement 1 is false because it's not \"at least 6 true.\"\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true contradicts Statement 5 being true because Statement 5 says only one of them can be true.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements (5) is prime, which it is.\n- Statement 7 is true because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Detailed check for 5 true statements\nLet's see if 5 true statements satisfy all conditions:\n- Statement 1: False (not at least 6 true)\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: False (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true)\n- Statement 6: True (5 is prime)\n- Statement 7: False (2 is not composite)\n\n## Step 9: Count the true and false statements for the 5 true statements scenario\nFor 5 true statements: Statements 2, 3, 4, 6 are true. Statement 1, 5, 7 are false. This gives us 4 true statements and 3 false statements, not 5 true.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the conditions and directly assess possible solutions\nLet's directly check the possible numbers of true statements and see which satisfy all given conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for other possible numbers of true statements\nLet's examine the statements for other possible configurations:\n- For 7 true statements, Statement 5 being true is a problem since it's false.\n- For 6 true statements, we have issues as seen.\n- For 5 true statements, we need to satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true and Statement 5 being false, which is possible but upon detailed check, it doesn't fit perfectly due to the truth values of other statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 implies that at least 6 out of 7 statements are true. This means if Statement 2 is true, then at least 6 statements must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 2 being true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then 6 or 7 statements are true. Let's check if this is possible. If 7 statements are true, then Statement 7 is true, which means the number of false statements (0) is composite. 0 is not considered composite, so 7 true statements is not valid. If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. The number of true statements is 6, which is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. This makes Statement 2, Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 7 potentially true. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because 6 statements are true. Statement 3 is false because exactly 4 are not true. Statement 4 is true because exactly 1 (which is 7-6) statement is false, and 7-1=6 statements are true, so 1 is false. Statement 5's truth value depends on Statements 3 and 4; since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true. Statement 7 is true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite. So, we have a potential issue here as Statement 7 being true with 1 false statement contradicts the definition of composite. Let's directly check the validity of having 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Check the validity of 6 true statements\nFor 6 true statements, Statement 6 is false (since 6 is not prime), and one of the statements must be false. If Statement 3 is false (because it says exactly 4 are true), Statement 6 is false (because 6 is not prime), or Statement 7 is false (because 1 is not composite), we need to check which one being false satisfies all conditions. If Statement 6 is false, then the other 6 can be true. Let's analyze: If Statement 6 is false, then Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 are true. But Statement 3 being true contradicts our assumption that exactly 6 statements are true. So, we need to find which statement being false allows the other conditions to be met.\n\n## Step 5: Detailed examination of Statement 1 to Statement 7\nLet's directly examine the possible number of true statements based on the statements given. Statement 1 implies $T \\geq 4$, Statement 2 implies $T \\geq 6$, Statement 3 implies $T = 4$, Statement 4 implies $T = 4$, Statement 5 implies that either $T = 4$ or $T = 4$ is not true (since $T=4$ makes both Statement 3 and Statement 4 true), Statement 6 implies $T$ is prime, and Statement 7 implies $F$ (number of false statements) is composite.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify using Statement 2's implication\nSince Statement 2 being true implies at least 6 statements are true, let's check the scenario where Statement 2 is true and see if it leads to a valid solution. If Statement 2 is true, and assuming 6 statements are true (since 7 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 7), the false statement must be either Statement 3 or Statement 6 because they are the ones that directly contradict the condition of having 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 7: Checking for valid configurations\nLet's directly check possible configurations based on the number of true statements. For $T = 4$, Statements 1, 3, 4, 5 must be considered. Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, which is a contradiction since both are true when $T = 4$. For $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true. For $T = 6$, we've already discussed the potential issues. For $T = 7$, it's not valid due to Statement 7.\n\n## Step 8: Checking Statement 5's condition with other statements\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If $T = 4$, both are true, so Statement 5 is false. This gives us a configuration where $T = 4$ and Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating $T = 4$ as a potential solution\nIf $T = 4$, then $F = 3$. Statement 1 is true ($T \\geq 4$), Statement 3 is true ($T = 4$), Statement 4 is true ($F = 3$), Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true), Statement 6 is false ($T = 4$ is not prime), and Statement 7 is true ($F = 3$ is not composite but Statement 7's condition is about being composite). Statement 2 is false ($T < 6$). So, Statements 1, 3, 4, 7 are true, and Statements 2, 5, 6 are false, giving $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 10: Verifying the $T = 4$ configuration\nFor $T = 4$, we have Statements 1, 3, 4, 7 as true. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4. Statement 7 is true because 3 is not composite, actually, it's not true because 3 is not composite. So, this configuration doesn't work because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 11: Checking $T = 5$\nFor $T = 5$, $F = 2$. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true ($T = 5$ is prime), and Statement 7 is true ($F = 2$ is not composite, actually, it is not true for $F=2$ because 2 is prime, not composite). So, Statements 1, 5, 6 are true. This configuration doesn't satisfy all conditions because Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 12: Final check for valid solutions\nLet's directly analyze the conditions again and simplify: For $T = 4$, we have a potential issue with Statement 7. For $T = 5$, Statements 1, 5, 6 are true, and Statement 7 is false because 2 is prime.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

This gives us a configuration where $T = 4$ and Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating $T = 4$ as a potential solution\nIf $T = 4$, then $F = 3$. Statement 1 is true ($T \\geq 4$), Statement 3 is true ($T = 4$), Statement 4 is true ($F = 3$), Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true), Statement 6 is false ($T = 4$ is not prime), and Statement 7 is true ($F = 3$ is not composite but Statement 7's condition is about being composite).

So, Statements 1, 3, 4, 7 are true, and Statements 2, 5, 6 are false, giving $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 10: Verifying the $T = 4$ configuration\nFor $T = 4$, we have Statements 1, 3, 4, 7 as true.

If all 7 are true, then Statement 1 is true, which is consistent. However, we need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 6 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for the possibility of 1 false statement among the 7, making it potentially consistent with Statement 1 if exactly 1 statement is false.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it must be the only true statement, which means all other statements, including Statement 1 and Statement 2, must be false. This creates a contradiction because if Statement 3 is true, Statement 1 and Statement 2 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that all statements are false. If all statements are false, then Statement 4 cannot be true because it claims to be true (by stating all are false), creating a paradox. Thus, Statement 4 being true is impossible.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 4 cannot be true (from Step 4), for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true.

This means Statement 1 is false, which is possible. Statement 2 is false because more than 1 statement is false. Statement 4 is false, which is consistent with our analysis.

This is hard to satisfy with other statements.\n- Statement 3 being true means only it is true, so 1 true statement. This makes Statement 5 false because Statement 4 is also false.\n- Statement 4 being true is impossible as it implies all statements are false.\n\n## Step 10: Checking for Possible Solutions\nLet's directly check the conditions:\n1. If Statement 3 is true, then only Statement 3 is true. This makes Statement 5 false because Statement 4 is false. So, we have 1 true statement.\n2. Checking Statement 5: If Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 must be true for Statement 5 to be true. But we've seen this leads to a contradiction because if Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 should be false.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluating Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. Let's check for possible numbers of true statements that satisfy both.\n\n## Step 12: Final Analysis\nLet's directly analyze:\n- For 1 true statement (Statement 3 true), Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 are false. Statement 6 is false because 1 is not considered prime in many mathematical contexts, but here it might be a point of discussion.

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze the statements given and understand what each implies about the truthfulness of the other statements. Statement 1 implies that at least 3 statements are true. Statement 2 implies that at most 3 statements are false, which means at least 4 statements are true. Statement 3 claims all 7 statements are true. Statement 4 claims exactly 2 statements are false, meaning 5 are true. Statement 5 suggests that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and its implications.\nStatement 3 says all 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then all other statements must also be true. However, this creates a contradiction with Statement 5 because if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 cannot be true (since Statement 4 says exactly 2 statements are false, and if Statement 3 is true, it implies all statements are true, making Statement 4 false). Thus, Statement 5 being true (as it must be if Statement 3 is true) supports the idea that Statement 4 is false. But if Statement 3 is true, it directly contradicts Statement 4 being true. So, we need to check if all statements can be true.\n\n## Step 3: Check the validity of Statement 3 being true.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true. This means Statement 4 is also true, which contradicts Statement 5 because Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the implications of Statement 3 being false.\nSince Statement 3 is false, not all 7 statements are true. This means Statement 1 (at least 3 true) and Statement 2 (at least 4 true) need to be examined closely along with other statements.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 4 and its implications.\nStatement 4 says exactly 2 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be one of the false statements (since we've established Statement 3 is false), and there must be one more false statement. Statement 5 being true would mean either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 4 is considered true in this scenario, Statement 3 is false, which aligns with our finding. However, this implies Statement 5 is false because it cannot be true if Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. So, we have a potential contradiction if we assume Statement 4 is true because it would make Statement 5 false, and we need to count the false statements.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the truthfulness of statements based on Statement 4 being true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false. We've established Statement 3 is false. For Statement 4 to be true, another statement must be false. Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 4 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, Statement 5 is the second false statement. Thus, we have Statement 3 and Statement 5 as false.\n\n## Step 7: Check the consistency of the remaining statements when Statement 4 is true.\nWith Statement 3 and Statement 5 being false, and Statement 4 being true, we have 5 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 6, Statement 7). Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true (we have 5). Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false (we have 2). Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements (5) is prime, which it is not (5 is prime, so this is actually true). Statement 7 is true because the number of false statements (2) is not composite (2 is prime, so this is false). So, Statement 7 is actually false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate the statements with the new information.\nSince Statement 7 is false (because 2 is prime, not composite), and we've already identified Statement 3 and Statement 5 as false, we actually have 3 false statements (Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 7), which contradicts our initial assumption that exactly 2 statements are false based on Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2 for possible truth values.\nStatement 1 says at least 3 statements are true, and Statement 2 says at least 4 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then Statement 1 is also true because if at least 4 statements are true, it's also true that at least 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the prime and composite conditions.\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, 7. Possible composite numbers of false statements are 4, 6.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate possible scenarios based on the number of true statements.\nLet's consider the cases: (i) 2 true statements, (ii) 3 true statements, (iii) 5 true statements, (iv) 7 true statements. We've already established that 7 true statements lead to a contradiction. For 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). For 3 true statements, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite). For 2 true statements, Statement 6 is true (since 2 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 5 is not composite, this is false).\n\n## Step 12: Check the validity of each possible number of true statements.\n- For 7 true statements, we've found it's not valid.\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 6 are true. Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is false, and Statement 7 is false. This gives us 4 true statements, not 5, so it's not valid.\n- For 3 true statements: If Statement 6 is one of the true statements, then the number of true statements is indeed 3, which is prime. Possible combinations need to be checked for consistency.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze the statements given and understand what each implies about the truthfulness of the other statements. Statement 1 implies that at least 3 statements are true. Statement 2 implies that at most 3 statements are false, which means at least 4 statements are true. Statement 3 claims all 7 statements are true. Statement 4 claims exactly 2 statements are false, meaning 5 are true. Statement 5 suggests that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and its implications.\nStatement 3 says all 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then all other statements must also be true. However, this creates a contradiction with Statement 5 because if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 cannot be true (since Statement 4 says exactly 2 statements are false, and if Statement 3 is true, it implies all statements are true, making Statement 4 false). Thus, Statement 5 being true (as it must be if Statement 3 is true) supports the idea that Statement 4 is false. But if Statement 3 is true, it directly contradicts Statement 4 being true. So, we need to check if all statements can be true.\n\n## Step 3: Check the validity of Statement 3 being true.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true. This means Statement 4 is also true, which contradicts Statement 5 because Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the implications of Statement 3 being false.\nSince Statement 3 is false, not all 7 statements are true. This means Statement 1 (at least 3 true) and Statement 2 (at least 4 true) need to be examined closely along with other statements.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 4 and its implications.\nStatement 4 says exactly 2 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be one of the false statements (since we've established Statement 3 is false), and there must be one more false statement. Statement 5 being true would mean either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 4 is considered true in this scenario, Statement 3 is false, which aligns with our finding. However, this implies Statement 5 is false because it cannot be true if Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. So, we have a potential contradiction if we assume Statement 4 is true because it would make Statement 5 false, and we need to count the false statements.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the truthfulness of statements based on Statement 4 being true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false. We've established Statement 3 is false. For Statement 4 to be true, another statement must be false. Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 4 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, Statement 5 is the second false statement. Thus, we have Statement 3 and Statement 5 as false.\n\n## Step 7: Check the consistency of the remaining statements when Statement 4 is true.\nWith Statement 3 and Statement 5 being false, and Statement 4 being true, we have 5 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 6, Statement 7). Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true (we have 5). Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false (we have 2). Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements (5) is prime, which it is not (5 is prime, so this is actually true). Statement 7 is true because the number of false statements (2) is not composite (2 is prime, so this is false). So, Statement 7 is actually false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate the statements with the new information.\nSince Statement 7 is false (because 2 is prime, not composite), and we've already identified Statement 3 and Statement 5 as false, we actually have 3 false statements (Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 7), which contradicts our initial assumption that exactly 2 statements are false based on Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2 for possible truth values.\nStatement 1 says at least 3 statements are true, and Statement 2 says at least 4 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then Statement 1 is also true because if at least 4 statements are true, it's also true that at least 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the prime and composite conditions.\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. For 7 statements, possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, 7. Possible composite numbers of false statements are 4, 6.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate possible scenarios based on the number of true statements.\nLet's consider the cases: (i) 2 true statements, (ii) 3 true statements, (iii) 5 true statements, (iv) 7 true statements. We've already established that 7 true statements lead to a contradiction. For 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). For 3 true statements, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 4 is composite). For 2 true statements, Statement 6 is true (since 2 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 5 is not composite, this is false).\n\n## Step 12: Check the validity of each possible number of true statements.\n- For 7 true statements, we've found it's not valid.\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 6 are true. Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is false, and Statement 7 is false. This gives us 4 true statements, not 5, so it's not valid.\n- For 3 true statements: If Statement 6 is one of the true statements, then the number of true statements is indeed 3, which is prime. Possible combinations need to be checked for consistency.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total. If all 7 are true, then Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. If all statements are true, then Statement 2 is also true because 0 false statements satisfy 'at most 7 false statements.'\n\n## Step 3: Examine the Implication of All Statements Being True\nIf all 7 statements are true, then:\n- Statement 3 ('Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.') is false because it contradicts the condition that all 7 are true.\n- Statement 4 ('Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.') is false because it implies 5 true statements, which again contradicts the condition that all 7 are true.\nThis creates a contradiction because if all statements are true, then Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (as they imply different numbers of true statements), we examine Statement 5, which states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' For Statement 5 to be true, one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be true, and the other false.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the Truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true. This means 2 are false. Statement 4 would be true if 2 statements are false, creating a contradiction because both cannot be true.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false, meaning 5 are true. This directly supports Statement 3 being potentially true, but again, both cannot be true according to Statement 5.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 being true means that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Let's examine the scenarios:\n- If Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, then 5 statements are true. Statement 5 is true, so we have at least 3 true statements (3 and 5). For 5 statements to be true, Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7 must also be considered.\n- If Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, then 5 statements are true (because 2 are false), which again supports the condition that Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 7: Examine Possible Scenarios Based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nLet's consider the case where Statement 3 is true (5 true statements) and Statement 4 is false:\n- 5 true statements imply that Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 or 7 are true. Statement 1 being true implies all 7 are true, which contradicts our assumption. So, this scenario is not possible under the condition that Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 8: Detailed Examination of Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true. This means Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and one other must be true. However, Statement 1 being true implies all statements are true, which contradicts the premise that exactly 5 are true.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed Examination of Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are false, and 5 are true. This means Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. So, we have Statements 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as potentially true.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the Truthfulness of Statements When Statement 4 is True\n- Statement 1 is false because not all 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 7 statements are false, and having 2 false satisfies this.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 needs to be true for 5 true statements, which is a prime number (5 is prime).\n- Statement 7 is true because 2 false statements is a composite number (though 2 is prime, not composite, this is a special case).\n\n## Step 11: Checking for Consistency with Statement 6 and Statement 7\n- Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements is prime. With 5 true statements, this is satisfied because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 states that the number of false statements is composite. With 2 false statements, this is not satisfied because 2 is prime, not composite.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the Scenario Where Statement 4 is True\nGiven Statement 4 is true, and thus 5 statements are true, we need to check the consistency:\n- Statements 2, 4, 5, and 6 are true.\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\nThis gives us 5 true statements (2, 4, 5, 6, and one more needs to be false, which is already considered), and it matches our condition.\n\n## Step 13: Finalize the Number of Possible Solutions\nLet's directly check the validity of having 5 true statements with Statement 4 being true:\n- True statements: 2, 4, 5, 6, and one more.\n- The combination that works is when Statements 2, 4, 5, 6 are true.

This implies that at least 5 of the 7 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 says exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then 4 statements are true, and 3 are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false. This means 2 statements are true, and 5 are false. If Statement 4 is true, then it must be one of the 2 true statements, making the other true statement one of the remaining 6.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true (4 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false (because it claims 2 true statements), and vice versa. We need to check the validity of Statement 5 under different scenarios.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluating the Truthfulness of Statements Together\nLet's examine the possible scenarios based on the statements:\n- If Statement 1 is true, all statements must be true. However, this contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4 because they cannot both be true. So, if all statements are true, Statement 5 is false, making it impossible for all 7 statements to be true.\n\n## Step 7: Checking Statement 1's Validity\nSince Statement 1 cannot be true (as it leads to a contradiction with Statement 5), it must be false. This means not all 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 8: Analyzing the Implications of Statement 1 Being False\nWith Statement 1 being false, at most 6 statements can be true. Let's analyze the other statements.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Statement 2\nIf Statement 2 is true, at least 5 statements are true. Let's check if this is possible. If 5 or 6 statements are true, Statement 1 is still false.\n\n## Step 10: Checking the Validity of Statements 3 and 4\nStatement 3 (exactly 4 true) and Statement 4 (exactly 2 true) cannot both be true.

So, Statement 5 being true is consistent with either Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluating Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.\n\n## Step 14: Checking Possible Scenarios\nLet's check the scenarios:\n- If Statement 3 is true (4 true statements), then Statement 4 is false. The number of true statements is 4, which is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. The number of false statements is 3, which is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n- If Statement 4 is true (2 true statements), then Statement 3 is false. The number of true statements is 2, which is prime, so Statement 6 is true. The number of false statements is 5, which is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 15: Detailed Analysis of Statement Combinations\nLet's analyze the truth values:\n- If Statement 3 is true, there are 4 true statements. This makes Statement 2, Statement 5, and Statement 3 true. Statement 1 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. So, we have 3 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5), which contradicts our assumption of 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 16: Further Analysis\nLet's directly check the conditions:\n- For 2 true statements (Statement 4 true), Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. So, we have Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as true. This gives us 3 true statements, which contradicts Statement 4.\n\n## Step 17: Checking for 5 True Statements\nIf 5 statements are true, then Statement 2 is true. Let's see if this scenario is possible.\n\n## Step 18: Evaluating the Scenario with 5 True Statements\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, and we need to check the other statements. Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 4 are true. Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 2 are true. Statement 5 is true because exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true (both are false). Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite (it's prime).\n\n## Step 19: Counting True Statements for the Scenario\nWe have Statement 2, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as true, which gives us 3 true statements so far. Statement 1 is false, Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false. To have 5 true statements, two more must be true. This could potentially be Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and two others. However, we've already established that Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 20: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nLet's directly assess the possible number of true statements and check for consistency:\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6 are true. This scenario requires 2 more true statements. Possible combinations need to be checked for consistency.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

The number of true statements is 2, which is prime, so Statement 6 is true. The number of false statements is 5, which is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 15: Detailed Analysis of Statement Combinations\nLet's analyze the truth values:\n- If Statement 3 is true, there are 4 true statements. This makes Statement 2, Statement 5, and Statement 3 true. Statement 1 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. So, we have 3 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5), which contradicts our assumption of 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 16: Further Analysis\nLet's directly check the conditions:\n- For 2 true statements (Statement 4 true), Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. So, we have Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as true. This gives us 3 true statements, which contradicts Statement 4.\n\n## Step 17: Checking for 5 True Statements\nIf 5 statements are true, then Statement 2 is true. Let's see if this scenario is possible.\n\n## Step 18: Evaluating the Scenario with 5 True Statements\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, and we need to check the other statements. Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 4 are true. Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 2 are true. Statement 5 is true because exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true (both are false). Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite (it's prime).\n\n## Step 19: Counting True Statements for the Scenario\nWe have Statement 2, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as true, which gives us 3 true statements so far. Statement 1 is false, Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false. To have 5 true statements, two more must be true. This could potentially be Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and two others. However, we've already established that Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 20: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nLet's directly assess the possible number of true statements and check for consistency:\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6 are true. This scenario requires 2 more true statements. Possible combinations need to be checked for consistency.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means if Statement 1 is true, there are 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that at most 1 of the 7 statements is false, implying that 6 or 7 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then it supports the condition that at least 6 statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says exactly 6 of the 7 statements are true. This implies 1 statement is false. If Statement 3 is true, then it must be one of the 6 true statements, which means one of the other statements must be false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 2 of the 7 statements are false, meaning 5 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, it is one of the 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true (6 true statements), Statement 4 cannot be true because it would be one of the true statements, making 7 true statements, which contradicts Statement 3. Similarly, if Statement 4 is true (5 true statements), Statement 3 cannot be true. Statement 5 being true means that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but since they cannot both be true due to their mutually exclusive conditions, we have to check their validity.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the Possibility of Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false (because it claims exactly 2 statements are false, which would be Statement 3 and another, making it false). Statement 5 would be true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, fulfilling its condition. Let's check other statements: Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 1 statement is false. Statement 6 needs to be checked; with 6 true statements, the number of true statements is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is composite; with 1 false statement, it's not composite (1 is not considered composite), so Statement 7 is false. This scenario gives us 6 true statements ( Statements 1, 2, 3, 4 is false, 5, and one more needs to be false), which actually doesn't fit because we need exactly 1 false statement for Statement 3 to be true, and we've identified two false statements (4, 6, and 7). So, this scenario doesn't work.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the Possibility of Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true, and 2 are false. Statement 3 must be one of the false statements because it claims 6 true statements. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Let's check the other statements: Statement 1 is true because 5 is at least 3. Statement 2 is false because more than 1 statement is false. Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements (5) is prime; 5 is prime, so Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is false because the number of false statements (2) is not composite (it's prime), so it is false. This gives us 5 true statements (Statements 1, 4, 5, 6) and 2 false statements (Statements 2, 3, and 7), which matches our condition for Statement 4 being true. The true statements are 1, 4, 5, 6, and one more. The false statements are 2, 3, and 7. So, Statements 1, 4, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 2, 3, 7 are false, which fits the condition of 5 true and 2 false statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check for Other Possible Combinations\nLet's directly assess the validity of each statement given the conditions and check for consistency.\n\n- For Statement 1 to be true, we need at least 3 true statements.\n- For Statement 2 to be true, we need 6 or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 3 being true implies 6 true statements.\n- Statement 4 being true implies 5 true statements.\n- Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, not both.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the Truthfulness Based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nWe've established that if Statement 3 is true, it leads to a contradiction because we can't have exactly 1 false statement among the statements that are supposed to be true. If Statement 4 is true, we have a valid scenario where 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 10: Verify the Number of True and False Statements for Valid Scenarios\nFor Statement 4 being true: Statements 1, 4, 5, 6 are true. Statement 2 is false because it says at most 1 is false, but we have 2 false statements. Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 6 are true. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is prime, not composite. So, true statements are 1, 4, 5, 6, and one more needs to be considered based on the conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' We need to analyze these statements for their implications on the truth values of the statements.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 implies that the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7. This means the number of false statements is 2, 1, or 0, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 implies that the number of false statements is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. This means the number of true statements is 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2, respectively.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 implies that exactly 5 statements are true, so 2 are false. Statement 4 implies that exactly 2 statements are false, so 5 are true. Both statements imply the same number of true and false statements (5 true, 2 false), so they are equivalent in terms of the count of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nGiven that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.') must be false because it asserts that only one of them can be true, but they are actually saying the same thing in terms of the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the implications of Statement 5 being false\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it depends on the truth values of Statement 3 and Statement 4, we know both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must be true or both false. However, if both are false, it contradicts the condition that exactly 5 statements are true (since Statement 3 being false would mean not exactly 5 are true, and Statement 4 being false would mean not exactly 2 are false, or not 5 are true).\n\n## Step 7: Examine the truth values based on Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then exactly 5 statements are true and 2 are false. This satisfies both Statement 1 and Statement 2. We need to check the other statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check Statement 6 and Statement 7 under the condition that 5 statements are true\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Since 5 is prime, Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. Since 2 is not composite (it's prime), Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Verify if having 5 true statements satisfies all conditions\nWith Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 being true, and Statement 5 and Statement 7 being false, we have 5 true statements and 2 false statements. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6. Statement 5 is false as required, and Statement 7 is false because 2 is prime, not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Check for other possible configurations\nLet's examine if there are other configurations that satisfy all given statements. We already know that having 5 true statements satisfies the conditions given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the case when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not 5. Statement 1 being true implies at least 5 true statements, so it could be 6 or 7 true statements. Statement 2 being true allows for up to 5 false statements, so it could be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements. However, Statement 5 being false is consistent with both being false.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the scenario with 6 true statements\nIf 6 statements are true, then Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6 (since 6 is not prime, this is false), and Statement 5 (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, it's true) could potentially be among the true statements. However, having 6 true statements means Statement 6 is false, so it cannot be one of the true statements. This gives us a potential configuration but we need to check if it satisfies all conditions.\n\n## Step 13: Check if 6 true statements is a valid solution\nWith 6 true statements, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 5 is true (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is false (because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 1 is not composite, this statement is false). So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5 true, and Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6, Statement 7 false. This gives us 3 true statements, not 6, which is inconsistent.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate the scenario with 7 true statements\nIf 7 statements are true, then all statements must be true. However, Statement 5 cannot be true if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, creating a contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means $T \\geq 4$, where $T$ is the number of true statements.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F \\leq 4$, where $F$ is the number of false statements. Since $T + F = 7$, this is equivalent to $T \\geq 3$.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means $T = 5$.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F = 0$ and thus $T = 7$.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This means that either $T = 5$ or $T = 7$, but not both.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $F$ could be 4 or 6, meaning $T$ could be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 4 and its implications\nStatement 4 claims $T = 7$. If Statement 4 is true, then all statements must be true. However, Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false. But if all statements are true (as Statement 4 claims), then Statement 3 and Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 4 is true because Statement 5 would be false due to both Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true. Thus, Statement 4 being true leads to a contradiction because it cannot be that all statements are true if Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 4\nGiven the contradiction found in Step 2, Statement 4 must be false. Therefore, $T \\neq 7$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 5 with the knowledge that Statement 4 is false\nSince Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 being true implies that Statement 3 must be true because Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Thus, if Statement 5 is true, $T = 5$ because Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 5: Check if $T = 5$ satisfies all conditions\nIf $T = 5$, then Statements 1, 3, 5, 6, and one other statement must be true.\n- Statement 1 is true because $T = 5 \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 2 is true because $F = 2 \\leq 4$.\n- Statement 3 is true by assumption.\n- Statement 4 is false, as established.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because $T = 5$ is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because $F = 2$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 6: Verify if $T = 5$ is a valid solution\nFor $T = 5$, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 being true, and Statements 4 and 7 being false. This satisfies Statement 1 ($T \\geq 4$), Statement 2 ($F \\leq 4$), Statement 3 ($T = 5$), and Statement 6 ($T = 5$ is prime). Statement 5 is also satisfied because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Thus, $T = 5$ is a valid solution.\n\n## Step 7: Check other possible values of $T$ based on the statements\nLet's examine other possible values for $T$ based on the constraints given by the statements, especially considering Statement 6 ($T$ is prime) and the fact that $T = 5$ is a solution.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate $T = 2$ and $T = 3$ as potential solutions\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. We need to check if there's a combination that works.\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 2 is true because $T \\geq 3$. We need to see if there's a valid combination.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed check for $T = 3$\nIf $T = 3$, then Statement 2 and Statement 6 are true. Statement 1 is false. For $T = 3$, $F = 4$, so Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. This gives us 3 true statements. Let's see which ones can be true: Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true. Statement 5 is false because it requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both, and both are false. Statement 3 is false ($T \\neq 5$), and Statement 4 is false ($T \\neq 7$). So, $T = 3$ with Statements 2, 6, and 7 being true is a valid configuration.\n\n## Step 10: Count the number of valid solutions\nWe have found two valid configurations: $T = 5$ and $T = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This means $T \\geq 4$, where $T$ is the number of true statements.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F \\leq 4$, where $F$ is the number of false statements. Since $T + F = 7$, this is equivalent to $T \\geq 3$.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This means $T = 5$.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F = 0$ and thus $T = 7$.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This means that either $T = 5$ or $T = 7$, but not both.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, $F$ could be 4 or 6, meaning $T$ could be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 4 and its implications\nStatement 4 claims $T = 7$. If Statement 4 is true, then all statements must be true. However, Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false. But if all statements are true (as Statement 4 claims), then Statement 3 and Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 4 is true because Statement 5 would be false due to both Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true. Thus, Statement 4 being true leads to a contradiction because it cannot be that all statements are true if Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 4\nGiven the contradiction found in Step 2, Statement 4 must be false. Therefore, $T \\neq 7$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 5 with the knowledge that Statement 4 is false\nSince Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 being true implies that Statement 3 must be true because Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Thus, if Statement 5 is true, $T = 5$ because Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 5: Check if $T = 5$ satisfies all conditions\nIf $T = 5$, then Statements 1, 3, 5, 6, and one other statement must be true.\n- Statement 1 is true because $T = 5 \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 2 is true because $F = 2 \\leq 4$.\n- Statement 3 is true by assumption.\n- Statement 4 is false, as established.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because $T = 5$ is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because $F = 2$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 6: Verify if $T = 5$ is a valid solution\nFor $T = 5$, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 being true, and Statements 4 and 7 being false. This satisfies Statement 1 ($T \\geq 4$), Statement 2 ($F \\leq 4$), Statement 3 ($T = 5$), and Statement 6 ($T = 5$ is prime). Statement 5 is also satisfied because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Thus, $T = 5$ is a valid solution.\n\n## Step 7: Check other possible values of $T$ based on the statements\nLet's examine other possible values for $T$ based on the constraints given by the statements, especially considering Statement 6 ($T$ is prime) and the fact that $T = 5$ is a solution.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate $T = 2$ and $T = 3$ as potential solutions\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. We need to check if there's a combination that works.\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 2 is true because $T \\geq 3$. We need to see if there's a valid combination.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed check for $T = 3$\nIf $T = 3$, then Statement 2 and Statement 6 are true. Statement 1 is false. For $T = 3$, $F = 4$, so Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. This gives us 3 true statements. Let's see which ones can be true: Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true. Statement 5 is false because it requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both, and both are false. Statement 3 is false ($T \\neq 5$), and Statement 4 is false ($T \\neq 7$).

This means if all statements were false, Statement 1 would be false, so at least one statement must be true.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 4 statements are true because 7 - 3 = 4.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states that 5 out of 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 3 out of 7 statements are true because 7 - 4 = 3.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This implies that either exactly 5 statements are true or exactly 3 statements are true, but not both.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. So, the number of false statements could be 4, 6, or other composite numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nIf Statement 1 is false, then all statements are false. However, if all statements are false, then Statement 1 being false is consistent with the condition that all statements are false. But we need to check the implications of other statements as well.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 2\nStatement 2 implies that at least 4 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then it supports the condition that at least 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine Statements 3 and 4\nStatement 3 says exactly 5 statements are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 4 statements are false (meaning 3 are true). Statement 5 indicates that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the implications of Statement 5\nIf Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means we have two cases to consider based on Statement 5 being true: (1) Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or (2) Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 6: Check the case when Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true. This makes Statement 4 false because it claims 3 statements are true. Statement 5 is true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. We need to check if this scenario is consistent with other statements.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements when Statement 3 is true\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false (2 are false, which is less than 3).\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6: 5 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7: 2 is not a composite number (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\nThis gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which matches Statement 3.\n\n## Step 8: Check the case when Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements are true. This makes Statement 3 false. Statement 5 is true because it is true that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements when Statement 4 is true\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2: If 3 statements are true, then 4 are false, which contradicts Statement 2. So, Statement 2 is false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6: 3 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7: 4 is a composite number, so Statement 7 is true.\n\nThis gives us 4 true statements (1, 4, 5, 6, 7) and 3 false statements (2, 3), which actually results in 5 true statements and 2 false statements if we count correctly: Statements 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are true. This contradicts our initial assumption that only 3 are true.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the scenarios for consistency\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and see which ones satisfy all conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for prime and composite numbers\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6).\n\n## Step 12: Analyze possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\n1. If 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. Statement 7 is true because 5 is not composite. This scenario doesn't fit because Statement 1 must be true, and if 2 statements are true, it could potentially be valid, but we need to check other statements.\n2. If 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. This is a potential scenario.\n3. If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. This is the scenario when Statement 3 is true.\n4. If 7 statements are true, then 0 are false. Statement 7 is false because 0 is not composite. This scenario is not valid because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n## Step 13: Checking the validity of the scenarios\nFor 3 true statements: Statements 1, 4, 7 could be true (because 4 is composite), and Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 5 is true if Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. This gives us a valid scenario where Statements 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 are true, which is 5 true statements, not 3. So, the initial assumption of 3 true statements doesn't hold when checking the statements.\n\n## Step 14: Final evaluation\nLet's directly assess the consistency of the statements with the possible truth values.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

If true, then it must be the only true statement, implying all others are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' If true, then all statements are false, which is a contradiction because it claims to be true. Thus, it must be false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given Statement 4 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true. But if Statement 3 is true, then it's the only true statement, making Statement 5 false.

However, this contradicts Statement 4 being true because Statement 4 claims all statements are false. Thus, if Statement 2 is true, it leads to a contradiction with Statement 4. But since Statement 2 being true implies all statements are true, it directly contradicts the fact that Statement 4 is false. Hence, Statement 2 cannot be true because it creates a paradox with other statements.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the truth value of Statement 2\nSince Statement 2 cannot be true, it must be false, meaning there is at least 1 false statement.\n\n## Step 9: Examine the truthfulness based on Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then it's the only true statement.

For Statement 7 to be true, $7-n$ must be composite.\n\n## Step 14: Analyze possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's examine possible values of $n$ (number of true statements) that satisfy Statement 6: $n = 2, 3, 5, 7$. For $n = 2$, $7-n = 5$ (not composite); for $n = 3$, $7-n = 4$ (composite); for $n = 5$, $7-n = 2$ (not composite); for $n = 7$, $7-n = 0$ (not composite).\n\n## Step 15: Check the scenario where $n = 3$\nIf $n = 3$, then Statement 6 is true. This implies Statement 1, Statement 6, and one more statement must be true. Statement 7 is also true because $7-3 = 4$ is composite. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as true, which satisfies $n = 3$.

Thus, Statement 3 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate Statement 4's truth value again and its implications\nStatement 4 is false because if it were true, all statements would be false, including itself, which is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Check the validity of Statement 5\nGiven Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false because it asserts that exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 12: Assess the number of true statements based on Statement 1\nSince Statement 3 is false, Statement 1 being true means there are at least 2 true statements. We need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the truthfulness of the statements considering Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' If there are $n$ true statements, then $7-n$ are false. For Statement 6 to be true, $n$ must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). For Statement 7 to be true, $7-n$ must be composite.\n\n## Step 14: Analyze possible scenarios based on the number of true statements\nLet's examine possible values of $n$ (number of true statements) that satisfy Statement 6: $n = 2, 3, 5, 7$. For $n = 2$, $7-n = 5$ (not composite); for $n = 3$, $7-n = 4$ (composite); for $n = 5$, $7-n = 2$ (not composite); for $n = 7$, $7-n = 0$ (not composite).\n\n## Step 15: Check the scenario where $n = 3$\nIf $n = 3$, then Statement 6 is true. This implies Statement 1, Statement 6, and one more statement must be true. Statement 7 is also true because $7-3 = 4$ is composite. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as true, which satisfies $n = 3$. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true (at least 2 true), Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (3 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (4 is composite). This configuration is consistent.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze the given statements. Statement 1 claims that at least 5 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 claims that at most 2 of the 7 statements are false, which is equivalent to saying at least 5 are true. Statement 3 says exactly 3 are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 1 is false (meaning 6 are true). Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2.\nBoth Statement 1 and Statement 2 imply that at least 5 statements are true. This means if either is true, the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 suggests 3 true statements, and Statement 4 suggests 6 true statements. According to Statement 5, only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. If Statement 3 is true, then there are 3 true statements, which contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2 being true. If Statement 4 is true, then there are 6 true statements, which supports Statement 1 and Statement 2 being true.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 5.\nGiven Statement 5, if Statement 3 is true (3 true statements), it contradicts Statements 1 and 2. So, Statement 3 being true is not possible if Statements 1 and 2 are true. Thus, Statement 4 must be true for Statement 5 to hold when considering the implications of Statements 1 and 2. This means Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the number of true statements based on the given conditions.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true. This would mean Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are true. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because 6 out of 7 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because only 1 statement is false. Statement 4 is true as assumed. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, this is a problem. Statement 7 is true because 1 is not considered composite, this is also a problem.\n\n## Step 6: Check the validity of having 6 true statements.\nHaving 6 true statements (Statement 4 being true) means Statement 3 is false. Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 being true implies: Statement 1 is true (6 true statements satisfy \"at least 5\"), Statement 2 is true (1 false statement satisfies \"at most 2 false\"), Statement 4 is true (1 false statement), Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime, and Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. This gives us 4 true statements (1, 2, 4, 5) and 3 false statements (3, 6, 7), which contradicts our initial assumption of 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 7: Re-evaluate the statements for other possible configurations.\nLet's directly check the statements for possible numbers of true statements: 5, 6, or 7, based on Statements 1 and 2.\n\n## Step 8: Check for 5 true statements.\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 6 is true if 5 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 is true if 2 is composite, which it is not (2 is prime). So, having 5 true statements could be a possibility if it satisfies other conditions.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the statements for 5 true statements.\nFor 5 true statements, Statements 1, 2, and 6 are true. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. We need to check which other two statements can be true. If Statement 4 is true (meaning 6 true statements), it contradicts our assumption. If Statement 3 is true, it means exactly 3 statements are true, which contradicts our assumption of 5 true statements. Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4; since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true because it states \"either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\" is false, but since both are false, it actually makes Statement 5 true. So, a possible configuration is Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 being true, and Statements 3, 4, 7 being false.\n\n## Step 10: Verify if the configuration satisfies all conditions.\nFor 5 true statements: Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true. Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 7 is false. This gives us 4 true statements, not 5, which doesn't fit. Let's directly assess viable configurations.\n\n## Step 11: Assess viable configurations directly.\nLet's examine the case where Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), which we've found to be problematic due to Statements 6 and 7. For 5 true statements, a valid configuration could be: Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, and one other being true. But we've seen the challenges in Step 9.\n\n## Step 12: Final evaluation of possible solutions.\nLet's directly check: If Statement 3 is true (3 true), it contradicts Statements 1 and 2. For 6 true statements (Statement 4 true), we've seen issues. For 5 true statements, a plausible set could be Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Here, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false, and Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 3 is false, Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

This gives us 4 true statements (1, 2, 4, 5) and 3 false statements (3, 6, 7), which contradicts our initial assumption of 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 7: Re-evaluate the statements for other possible configurations.\nLet's directly check the statements for possible numbers of true statements: 5, 6, or 7, based on Statements 1 and 2.\n\n## Step 8: Check for 5 true statements.\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. Statement 6 is true if 5 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 is true if 2 is composite, which it is not (2 is prime). So, having 5 true statements could be a possibility if it satisfies other conditions.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the statements for 5 true statements.\nFor 5 true statements, Statements 1, 2, and 6 are true. Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. We need to check which other two statements can be true. If Statement 4 is true (meaning 6 true statements), it contradicts our assumption. If Statement 3 is true, it means exactly 3 statements are true, which contradicts our assumption of 5 true statements. Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4; since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true because it states \"either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\" is false, but since both are false, it actually makes Statement 5 true.

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' We need to understand that Statement 2 is equivalent to saying 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true' because if at most 3 are false, then at least 4 are true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true,' which implies 3 are false. Statement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which implies 4 are true. Thus, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent in terms of the number of true and false statements they imply.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate Statement 5 based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5, which states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both,' must be false because it is impossible for one to be true and the other false given they are equivalent.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the implications of Statement 5 being false\nWith Statement 5 being false, we have 6 statements left to evaluate. The number of true statements among the remaining 6 statements will determine the total number of true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the possible number of true statements based on the remaining statements\nLet's denote the number of true statements among the 7 statements as $T$. If $T = 7$, then Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true (since 0 false statements is less than or equal to 3), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 0 is not composite). This gives us 3 true statements (1, 2, 6), which contradicts $T = 7$. So, $T$ cannot be 7.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate $T = 6$\nIf $T = 6$, then Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because having 1 false statement is within 'at most 3 false.' Statement 3 is false because it claims exactly 4 are true. Statement 4 is true because it says exactly 3 are false, which is not the case here but let's continue evaluating. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 1 is not composite, but this statement refers to the number of false statements being composite, and 1 is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 4, and 7 as potentially true. This gives us a potential $T$ but we need to check consistency.\n\n## Step 7: Detailed check for $T = 6$\nFor $T = 6$, Statements 1, 2, 4, and 7 being true: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 4 is true (which matches $T = 4$, not $T = 6$, so it's actually false), and Statement 7 is false because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite. This inconsistency means $T = 6$ is not valid upon detailed inspection because Statement 4 cannot be true if $T = 6$.\n\n## Step 8: Check other possible values of $T$\nLet's directly assess the validity of other statements based on possible $T$. For $T = 4$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 3 is not composite, this is false). So, for $T = 4$, we have Statements 2, 3, and 4 as potentially true, but Statement 4 and Statement 3 being true contradicts our initial finding that they are equivalent and Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate $T = 5$\nIf $T = 5$, then Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is prime, not composite). So, Statements 1, 2, and 6 are true. This gives $T = 3$, which does not match our assumption of $T = 5$. Thus, $T = 5$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 10: Assess $T = 4$ more carefully considering Statement 5 is false\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, both being true or both being false are possibilities. For $T = 4$, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, which is a valid scenario because they are equivalent. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. So, we have $T = 2$ ( Statements 2 and 3 or 4), which doesn't fit $T = 4$. Let's directly check the statements for $T = 4$: If $T = 4$, Statements 2 and 3 (or 4) are true. This scenario is plausible because it satisfies the condition that at least 4 statements are true is not met, but at most 3 are false is met.\n\n## Step 11: Final evaluation for possible $T$\nLet's directly check for $T = 4$: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false, Statement 7 is false. This gives $T = 4$ ( Statements 2, 3, 4 are true), which is a possible solution because it satisfies the given conditions when considering the truth values.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which implies 4 are true.

The number of true statements among the remaining 6 statements will determine the total number of true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the possible number of true statements based on the remaining statements\nLet's denote the number of true statements among the 7 statements as $T$. If $T = 7$, then Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true (since 0 false statements is less than or equal to 3), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 0 is not composite). This gives us 3 true statements (1, 2, 6), which contradicts $T = 7$. So, $T$ cannot be 7.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate $T = 6$\nIf $T = 6$, then Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true because having 1 false statement is within 'at most 3 false.' Statement 3 is false because it claims exactly 4 are true. Statement 4 is true because it says exactly 3 are false, which is not the case here but let's continue evaluating. Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because 1 is not composite, but this statement refers to the number of false statements being composite, and 1 is not composite.

This inconsistency means $T = 6$ is not valid upon detailed inspection because Statement 4 cannot be true if $T = 6$.\n\n## Step 8: Check other possible values of $T$\nLet's directly assess the validity of other statements based on possible $T$. For $T = 4$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 3 is not composite, this is false). So, for $T = 4$, we have Statements 2, 3, and 4 as potentially true, but Statement 4 and Statement 3 being true contradicts our initial finding that they are equivalent and Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate $T = 5$\nIf $T = 5$, then Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is prime, not composite). So, Statements 1, 2, and 6 are true. This gives $T = 3$, which does not match our assumption of $T = 5$. Thus, $T = 5$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 10: Assess $T = 4$ more carefully considering Statement 5 is false\nSince Statement 5 is false, and it claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, both being true or both being false are possibilities. For $T = 4$, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, which is a valid scenario because they are equivalent. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false. So, we have $T = 2$ ( Statements 2 and 3 or 4), which doesn't fit $T = 4$.

Statement 5 confirms this by stating that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 individually.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true.

Statement 2 (at most 7 false) is true because it allows for 0 to 7 statements to be false, and having 5 false statements satisfies this. Statement 4 is false because it contradicts Statement 3. Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. So, we have Statement 3, Statement 2, and Statement 5 as potentially true. Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) is false because 2 is prime, but this needs to be checked against other true statements. Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) is true if 5 statements are false, which is the case here (5 is not composite, it's a prime number, so Statement 7 is false). Thus, having Statement 3, Statement 2, and Statement 5 true satisfies the condition of exactly 2 statements being true is not possible because we have at least 3 true statements (Statement 3, Statement 2, and Statement 5), which contradicts Statement 3.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the scenario when Statement 4 is true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true. This implies Statement 3 is false. Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 7 statements are false. Statement 5 is true because it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, we have at least Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 5 as true. For 5 statements to be true, we need one more true statement. Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements (5) is prime. Since 5 is indeed a prime number, Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 states that the number of false statements is composite. With 2 false statements, Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. Thus, the true statements could be Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6, making 5 true statements, which is a valid scenario.\n\n## Step 6: Check the validity of the number of true and false statements based on Statement 6 and Statement 7.\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true. For 2 false statements, Statement 7 is false. This satisfies the condition of having 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 7: Summarize the findings.\nWe have found that one possible solution is when Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true, making 5 statements true. This scenario is consistent with the statements being true or false as per their claims.\n\n## Step 8: Check for other possible solutions.\nLet's examine other potential distributions of true and false statements. If Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, we've already seen the challenges in making this work. For other numbers of true statements, we need to check against all statements.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the prime and composite conditions further.\nStatement 6 being true means the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). Statement 7 being true or false depends on the number of false statements being composite.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the number of possible solutions based on the conditions.\nWe've identified one valid solution where 5 statements are true. Let's check other prime numbers of true statements: 2, 3, 7. For 2 true statements, we've seen issues with consistency. For 3 true statements, Statement 1 is true, and it's possible. For 7 true statements, Statement 7 is false because 0 is not composite.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 1 claims that at least 3 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 claims that at most 7 of the statements are false, which implies that at least 0 statements are true. Statement 3 states that exactly 2 of the statements are true. Statement 4 states that exactly 2 of the statements are false, implying that 5 statements are true. Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they imply different numbers of true statements (2 and 5, respectively). Statement 5 confirms this by stating that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 individually.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false. For Statement 3 to be true, the other true statement could be Statement 5 (since it allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both), and one other statement.

This implies Statement 3 is false. Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 7 statements are false. Statement 5 is true because it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, we have at least Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 5 as true. For 5 statements to be true, we need one more true statement. Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements (5) is prime. Since 5 is indeed a prime number, Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 states that the number of false statements is composite. With 2 false statements, Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.

This means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. If Statement 1 is true, then all other statements must also be true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 4 of the statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states that 4 out of 7 statements are true, and the remaining 3 are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 4 out of 7 statements are true, as 7 - 3 = 4. It is equivalent to Statement 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, they cannot be one true and the other false; they are either both true or both false. Thus, Statement 5 cannot be true because it demands that one is true and the other is false.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the Truthfulness of Statements Based on Statement 5\nGiven that Statement 5 is false, we can now assess the implications. Since Statement 5 is false, it means either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false.\n\n## Step 7: Assess the Implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 Being True or False\nIf both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, it implies that exactly 4 statements are true. If both are false, then the condition of having exactly 4 true statements or exactly 3 false statements is not met.\n\n## Step 8: Examine Statement 1 with Other Statements\nIf Statement 1 is true, all statements must be true, which contradicts Statement 5 being false. Thus, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 2 with the Knowledge that Statement 1 is False\nSince Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 being true means that at most 3 statements are false, implying at least 4 statements are true. This is consistent with Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 10: Check the Consistency of Statements When Statement 3 and Statement 4 Are True\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then exactly 4 statements are true. This makes Statement 6 (the number of true statements is a prime number) false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 (the number of false statements is a composite number) would be true because 3 is not composite, it's a prime, so this statement is actually false since 3 is not composite.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the Truthfulness of Statements 6 and 7\nStatement 6 is false if the number of true statements is not prime. Statement 7 is false if the number of false statements is not composite. For 4 true statements, Statement 6 is false. For 3 false statements, Statement 7 is false because 3 is prime, not composite.\n\n## Step 12: Assess Possible Combinations\nLet's directly assess the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and check for consistency across all statements.\n\n## Step 13: Check for Consistency Across All Statements\n- If Statement 1 is true, all statements are true, which is impossible due to Statement 5 being false.\n- Statement 5 is false, so both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are either true or false. If they are true, exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 14: Detailed Check for 4 True Statements\nIf 4 statements are true (as per Statement 3 and Statement 4), the true statements could be Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and one other. However, Statement 6 and Statement 7 cannot be true because 4 is not prime and 3 is not composite.\n\n## Step 15: Evaluate Possible Scenarios\nLet's directly check the scenarios:\n1. If 4 statements are true (Statement 3 and Statement 4 true), then Statement 2 is true. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is prime. So, we have Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and one more true statement.

If Statement 1 is false, then fewer than 2 statements are true, meaning 0 or 1 statement is true. However, if 0 statements are true, then Statement 1 is actually true because it's saying at least 2 are true is false, but it doesn't directly relate to being false itself. If exactly 1 statement is true, then Statement 1 being that true statement creates a contradiction because it claims at least 2 are true. So, if Statement 1 is the only true statement, it's false. Thus, for Statement 1 to be false, it must be that no statements are true, but this leads to a contradiction when considering Statement 1's truth value. Hence, Statement 1 must be true because if it's false, it leads to a contradiction when assuming it's the only true statement.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This means at least 6 statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, then at most 1 statement is false, implying 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the Implications of Statement 1 and Statement 2 Being True\nIf Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true, then at least 2 statements are true (Statement 1) and at most 1 is false (Statement 2), which together imply that exactly 6 or 7 statements are true. Statement 1 being true is consistent with 6 or 7 statements being true.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which is equivalent to saying exactly 4 statements are true. Thus, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent and cannot both be true under the condition that they are saying the same thing.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, Statement 5 is false because it demands that exactly one of them is true, but they are the same statement in terms of truth condition.\n\n## Step 6: Assess the Truthfulness Based on Statement 3 and Statement 4 Being Equivalent\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, they are either both true or both false. Statement 5 being false implies that either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the Possibility of Exactly 4 Statements Being True\nIf exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statement 3 and Statement 4), then Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true. This scenario makes Statement 5 false. We need to check if this aligns with other statements.\n\n## Step 8: Check the Consistency of Statements When Exactly 4 Are True\nIf exactly 4 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true (since at least 2 are true), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, and Statement 5 is false. Statement 2 is false because it says at most 1 statement is false, but we have 3 false statements. Statement 6 (the number of true statements is a prime number) is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 (the number of false statements is a composite number) is true because 3 is not composite, it's a mistake to consider it true; 3 is indeed not composite, so Statement 7 is false. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 3, and Statement 4 as true, and the rest false. This gives us 3 true statements, not 4, which contradicts our initial assumption. Thus, exactly 4 being true is not a valid solution under the given statements' constraints.\n\n## Step 9: Consider Statement 2 Being True and Its Implications\nIf Statement 2 is true, then at least 6 statements are true. This would mean Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, and at least one more are true. However, Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because Statement 5 is false, implying that if Statement 2 is true, we have a contradiction because we cannot satisfy the condition that exactly 6 or 7 statements are true without violating other conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' For 7 statements, the possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, 7. The possible composite numbers of false statements are 4, 6.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze Possible Combinations Based on Statement 6 and Statement 7\nIf the number of true statements is prime (Statement 6), and given that Statement 1 is true, the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite, meaning 4 or 6 false statements, corresponding to 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 12: Check for Valid Solutions\nLet's directly check the validity of different numbers of true statements:\n- For 2 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 is true if 2 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite. This is a possible scenario.\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 4 is composite, so it's actually true. This gives a potential valid scenario where Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true.\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 2 is not composite, so it's false. This is not valid because Statement 7 is false.\n- For 7 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite). Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, and Statement 5 is false. This scenario is not valid because Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed Check for 3 True Statements\nIf 3 statements are true, and considering Statement 1 is one of them, we need to find two other true statements. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. So, Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 being true is a valid combination.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' For 7 statements, the possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, 7. The possible composite numbers of false statements are 4, 6.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze Possible Combinations Based on Statement 6 and Statement 7\nIf the number of true statements is prime (Statement 6), and given that Statement 1 is true, the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite, meaning 4 or 6 false statements, corresponding to 3 or 1 true statements, respectively.\n\n## Step 12: Check for Valid Solutions\nLet's directly check the validity of different numbers of true statements:\n- For 2 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 is true if 2 is prime, which it is. Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite. This is a possible scenario.\n- For 3 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 4 is composite, so it's actually true. This gives a potential valid scenario where Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true.\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 1 is true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 2 is not composite, so it's false. This is not valid because Statement 7 is false.\n- For 7 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite). Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, and Statement 5 is false. This scenario is not valid because Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 13: Detailed Check for 3 True Statements\nIf 3 statements are true, and considering Statement 1 is one of them, we need to find two other true statements. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite. So, Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 being true is a valid combination.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 1 says at least 2 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 says at most 3 of the 7 statements are false, which implies at least 4 are true. Statement 3 says exactly 4 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 4 says exactly 3 of the 7 statements are false, which implies exactly 4 are true. Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statements 3 and 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 both imply that exactly 4 statements are true because Statement 4 says exactly 3 are false, which means 4 are true. This makes them equivalent in terms of the number of true statements they assert.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate Statement 5 based on the analysis of Statements 3 and 4.\nSince Statements 3 and 4 are equivalent, Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, must be false because it is impossible for one to be true and the other false if they are saying the same thing.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the implications of Statement 5 being false.\nWith Statement 5 being false, we have 6 statements left to evaluate. Statement 5 being false means that either both Statements 3 and 4 are true or both are false.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the case when both Statements 3 and 4 are true.\nIf both Statements 3 and 4 are true, then exactly 4 statements are true. This would mean Statement 1 (at least 2 true), Statement 2 (at least 4 true), Statement 3 (exactly 4 true), and Statement 4 (exactly 4 true) are true. Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) would be false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) would be true because 3 is not composite, it's a prime number, so this statement is actually false since 3 is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 as true, and Statements 5, 6, and 7 as false. This gives us 4 true statements, which matches Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 6: Verify if the scenario where Statements 3 and 4 are true satisfies all conditions.\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\n\nThis scenario is consistent with having exactly 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the case when both Statements 3 and 4 are false.\nIf both are false, then the number of true statements is not 4. Statement 1 being true implies at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 being true implies at least 4 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then we have at least 4 true statements. Let's check the consistency.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the truthfulness of the statements when Statements 3 and 4 are false.\n- If Statement 1 is true, it supports the condition.\n- If Statement 2 is true, it means at least 4 statements are true. But if 4 or more statements are true, then Statement 6 being true (since 4 or more could be prime if it's 2, 3, 5, or 7) or false (if it's 4 or 6) depends on the actual count.\n- Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements is composite.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate possible distributions of true and false statements when Statements 3 and 4 are false.\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n1. If 2 statements are true, Statements 1 and 6 could be true (since 2 is prime), and Statement 7 would be false because 5 is not composite. Statement 2 would be false.\n2. If 3 statements are true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 4 is composite). Statement 2 is false.\n3. If 4 statements are true, we've already considered this scenario with Statements 3 and 4 being true.\n4. If 5 statements are true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). This is a possible scenario.\n5. If 6 or 7 statements are true, Statement 2 is true, and Statement 6 is false for 6 true statements (since 6 is not prime) and true for 7 true statements (since 7 is prime). For 6 true statements, Statement 7 is true (since 1 is not composite). For 7 true statements, Statement 7 is false (since 0 is not composite).\n\n## Step 10: Check the validity of each possible distribution.\nFor 2 true statements: Statements 1, 6 could be true. But Statement 2 is false, and Statement 5 is false. This gives us a possible combination but needs to be checked against all statements.\nFor 3 true statements: Statements 1, 6 are true. Statement 2 is false, and Statement 7 is false. This is a potential solution.\nFor 5 true statements: Statements 1, 2, 6 are true. Statement 7 is false. This is a valid scenario because it satisfies the conditions for being true.\n\n## Step 11: Summarize the findings.\nWe have found that there are valid scenarios where the statements can be true or false in a way that satisfies the given conditions.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze the given statements. Statement 1 says at least 2 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 2 says at most 3 of the 7 statements are false, which implies at least 4 are true. Statement 3 says exactly 4 of the 7 statements are true. Statement 4 says exactly 3 of the 7 statements are false, which implies exactly 4 are true. Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statements 3 and 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 both imply that exactly 4 statements are true because Statement 4 says exactly 3 are false, which means 4 are true. This makes them equivalent in terms of the number of true statements they assert.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate Statement 5 based on the analysis of Statements 3 and 4.\nSince Statements 3 and 4 are equivalent, Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, must be false because it is impossible for one to be true and the other false if they are saying the same thing.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the implications of Statement 5 being false.\nWith Statement 5 being false, we have 6 statements left to evaluate. Statement 5 being false means that either both Statements 3 and 4 are true or both are false.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the case when both Statements 3 and 4 are true.\nIf both Statements 3 and 4 are true, then exactly 4 statements are true. This would mean Statement 1 (at least 2 true), Statement 2 (at least 4 true), Statement 3 (exactly 4 true), and Statement 4 (exactly 4 true) are true. Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) would be false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) would be true because 3 is not composite, it's a prime number, so this statement is actually false since 3 is not composite. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 as true, and Statements 5, 6, and 7 as false. This gives us 4 true statements, which matches Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 6: Verify if the scenario where Statements 3 and 4 are true satisfies all conditions.\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\n\nThis scenario is consistent with having exactly 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the case when both Statements 3 and 4 are false.\nIf both are false, then the number of true statements is not 4. Statement 1 being true implies at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 being true implies at least 4 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then we have at least 4 true statements. Let's check the consistency.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the truthfulness of the statements when Statements 3 and 4 are false.\n- If Statement 1 is true, it supports the condition.\n- If Statement 2 is true, it means at least 4 statements are true. But if 4 or more statements are true, then Statement 6 being true (since 4 or more could be prime if it's 2, 3, 5, or 7) or false (if it's 4 or 6) depends on the actual count.\n- Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements is composite.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate possible distributions of true and false statements when Statements 3 and 4 are false.\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n1. If 2 statements are true, Statements 1 and 6 could be true (since 2 is prime), and Statement 7 would be false because 5 is not composite. Statement 2 would be false.\n2. If 3 statements are true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 4 is composite). Statement 2 is false.\n3. If 4 statements are true, we've already considered this scenario with Statements 3 and 4 being true.\n4. If 5 statements are true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). This is a possible scenario.\n5. If 6 or 7 statements are true, Statement 2 is true, and Statement 6 is false for 6 true statements (since 6 is not prime) and true for 7 true statements (since 7 is prime). For 6 true statements, Statement 7 is true (since 1 is not composite). For 7 true statements, Statement 7 is false (since 0 is not composite).\n\n## Step 10: Check the validity of each possible distribution.\nFor 2 true statements: Statements 1, 6 could be true. But Statement 2 is false, and Statement 5 is false. This gives us a possible combination but needs to be checked against all statements.\nFor 3 true statements: Statements 1, 6 are true. Statement 2 is false, and Statement 7 is false. This is a potential solution.\nFor 5 true statements: Statements 1, 2, 6 are true. Statement 7 is false. This is a valid scenario because it satisfies the conditions for being true.\n\n## Step 11: Summarize the findings.\nWe have found that there are valid scenarios where the statements can be true or false in a way that satisfies the given conditions.

This implies that not all statements are false.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 4 statements are true.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This gives a specific count of true statements.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that exactly 4 statements are true, which is the same as Statement 3.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing, this statement cannot be true because it demands that only one of them is true, but they are equivalent.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5 and its implications\nStatement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent because they both state that exactly 4 statements are true. Therefore, Statement 5 must be false because it is impossible for exactly one of two equivalent statements to be true.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the truth value of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nGiven that Statement 5 is false, and knowing that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent, we can conclude that either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false. If both are true, then exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true, then there are exactly 4 true statements. This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 are true. Statement 5 is false as established. Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) is false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) is true because there are 3 false statements, and 3 is not composite, it's prime, so Statement 7 is actually false. Thus, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (True), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (False), and Statement 7 (False). This gives us 4 true statements, which matches Statement 3 and Statement 4. However, Statement 7 is false because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true satisfies all conditions\nLet's count the true and false statements: True statements = Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4 (4 statements); False statements = Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7 (3 statements). Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true. Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false. Statement 3 is true as there are exactly 4 true statements. Statement 4 is true as there are exactly 3 false statements. Statement 5 is false, which is correct. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is prime, not composite. So, this scenario is plausible.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 under the condition that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true\nSince there are 4 true statements and 3 false statements, Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime) and Statement 7 is false (because 3 is prime, not composite). This matches our count.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not 4. Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our initial finding. We need to check other statements. Statement 1 is true because there is at least one true statement. Statement 2's truth value depends on the number of false statements.\n\n## Step 8: Examine possible distributions when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nLet's consider the implications:\n- If Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, we have at least 2 false statements.\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- So, we have at least 3 false statements.\n\n## Step 9: Check the condition for Statement 2 when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nFor Statement 2 to be true, at most 3 statements can be false. If Statement 2 is true, then we have between 4 and 7 true statements (since at least 4 are true), but this contradicts our assumption that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false (implying not exactly 4 true statements).\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the possible number of true statements when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, and assuming Statement 2 is false (because if it's true, it implies at least 4 true statements, which would make Statement 3 or Statement 4 potentially true or require a different distribution), we have more than 3 false statements. Let's count: Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5 are false (3 false statements so far). If Statement 2 is also false, we have 4 false statements.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the truthfulness of the statements when Statement 2 is false\nIf Statement 2 is false, it means more than 3 statements are false. So, we have at least 4 false statements. Let's check: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (False), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (?), Statement 7 (?). We have 5 false statements and 2 true statements (Statement 1 and potentially others).\n\n## Step 12: Check the validity of Statement 6 and Statement 7 when there are 2 true statements\nWith 2 true statements and 5 false statements, Statement 6 is false because 2 is prime, so it is actually true. Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite (it's not, 5 is prime). So, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (False), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (True), Statement 7 (False). This gives us 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 13: Verify if having 2 true statements satisfies all given conditions\nStatement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false (more than 3 false statements). Statement 3 is false (not exactly 4 true). Statement 4 is false (not exactly 3 false). Statement 5 is false (both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false). Statement 6 is true (2 is prime). Statement 7 is false (5 is not composite). So, we have 2 true statements (Statement 1 and Statement 6), which satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This gives us 4 true statements, which matches Statement 3 and Statement 4. However, Statement 7 is false because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true satisfies all conditions\nLet's count the true and false statements: True statements = Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4 (4 statements); False statements = Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7 (3 statements). Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true. Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false. Statement 3 is true as there are exactly 4 true statements. Statement 4 is true as there are exactly 3 false statements. Statement 5 is false, which is correct. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is prime, not composite. So, this scenario is plausible.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 under the condition that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true\nSince there are 4 true statements and 3 false statements, Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime) and Statement 7 is false (because 3 is prime, not composite). This matches our count.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the scenario where Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, then the number of true statements is not 4. Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our initial finding. We need to check other statements. Statement 1 is true because there is at least one true statement. Statement 2's truth value depends on the number of false statements.\n\n## Step 8: Examine possible distributions when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nLet's consider the implications:\n- If Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, we have at least 2 false statements.\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false.\n- So, we have at least 3 false statements.\n\n## Step 9: Check the condition for Statement 2 when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nFor Statement 2 to be true, at most 3 statements can be false. If Statement 2 is true, then we have between 4 and 7 true statements (since at least 4 are true), but this contradicts our assumption that Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false (implying not exactly 4 true statements).\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the possible number of true statements when Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false\nIf Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, and assuming Statement 2 is false (because if it's true, it implies at least 4 true statements, which would make Statement 3 or Statement 4 potentially true or require a different distribution), we have more than 3 false statements. Let's count: Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5 are false (3 false statements so far). If Statement 2 is also false, we have 4 false statements.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the truthfulness of the statements when Statement 2 is false\nIf Statement 2 is false, it means more than 3 statements are false. So, we have at least 4 false statements. Let's check: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (False), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (?), Statement 7 (?). We have 5 false statements and 2 true statements (Statement 1 and potentially others).\n\n## Step 12: Check the validity of Statement 6 and Statement 7 when there are 2 true statements\nWith 2 true statements and 5 false statements, Statement 6 is false because 2 is prime, so it is actually true. Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite (it's not, 5 is prime). So, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (False), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (False), Statement 5 (False), Statement 6 (True), Statement 7 (False). This gives us 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 13: Verify if having 2 true statements satisfies all given conditions\nStatement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false (more than 3 false statements). Statement 3 is false (not exactly 4 true). Statement 4 is false (not exactly 3 false). Statement 5 is false (both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false). Statement 6 is true (2 is prime). Statement 7 is false (5 is not composite). So, we have 2 true statements (Statement 1 and Statement 6), which satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This implies that the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 4. So, $T \\geq 4$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2.\nStatement 2 says 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 5. Since $T + F = 7$, this implies $T \\geq 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3.\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This means $T = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4.\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F = 3$, hence $T = 4$ because $T + F = 7$.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5.\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, if either is true, the other must be true as well because they both lead to the same conclusion ($T = 4$). Thus, Statement 5 cannot be true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 together.\nSince both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, they are either both true or both false. Statement 5's truthfulness depends on this. If both are true, Statement 5 is false. If both are false, Statement 5 is still false because it requires exactly one of them to be true.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 6.\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 for Statement 6 to be true.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 7.\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For $F$ to be composite, $F$ could be 4 or 6 since $F = 7 - T$. This means $T$ could be 3 or 1 for Statement 7 to be true. However, $T = 1$ is not possible because it would make $F = 6$, which is composite, but we need to check all statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the possible values of T based on the statements.\nLet's examine the possible values of $T$:\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both 3 and 4 are false), Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. So, $T = 3$ ( Statements 2, 5, 6 are true).\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true. So, $T = 4$ (Statements 2, 4, 6, 7 are true).\n- For $T = 4$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false (because 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (because 3 is not composite). So, $T = 4$ (Statements 1, 2, 3, 4 are true).\n- For $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true. So, $T = 5$ (Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 are true).\n- For $T = 7$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false. So, $T = 4$ (Statements 1, 2, 5, 6 are true).\n\n## Step 11: Check the consistency of the statements for each possible T.\n- For $T = 4$, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 4 as true, and Statements 5, 6, 7 as false. This is consistent with $T = 4$.\n- For $T = 5$, we have Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 as true, and Statements 3, 4 as false. This is consistent with $T = 5$.\n\n## Step 12: Determine the number of possible solutions based on the analysis.\nFrom Step 11, we see that $T = 4$ and $T = 5$ are possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

Statement 5 asserts that exactly one of them is true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true, which means Statement 3 itself is the only true statement, and all others are false. This includes Statement 5 being false, which contradicts Statement 5's requirement that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Thus, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 must be false. However, we need to check the consistency of Statement 3 being true with other statements. If Statement 3 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are false. Statement 1 being false implies fewer than 4 true statements, which is consistent with Statement 3. Statement 2 being false implies more than 2 false statements, which is also consistent. Statement 4 being false is consistent with Statement 3 being true. Statement 6 being false implies the number of true statements is not prime, but since there's 1 true statement, it's not prime, so this is consistent.

Statement 3 and 4 are false. Let's check: Statement 1 is true because at least 4 are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 are false (1 is false, which is Statement 3 or 4).

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements to understand their implications on the number of true and false statements among them.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says, 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that the number of true statements is 6 or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says, 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means the number of false statements is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Consequently, the number of true statements is 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims, 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states that 2 statements are true and 5 are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 states, 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says, 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they contradict each other. If Statement 3 is true (2 true statements), then Statement 4 is false. If Statement 4 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then there are 2 true statements. This means Statement 1 is false because it claims at least 6 statements are true. Statement 4 is false because it claims exactly 2 statements are false, which would mean 5 true statements. Statement 5 is true because it states either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. So, we have at least 2 true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 5). However, this contradicts the claim of Statement 3 that exactly 2 statements are true. Thus, Statement 3 being true leads to a contradiction.\n\n## Step 8: Examine the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false, and 5 statements are true. Statement 3 must be false. Statement 5 is true because it is true that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Let's check the other statements: Statement 1 can be true if 5 or more statements are true, so it's potentially true. Statement 2 can be true because having 2 false statements satisfies 'at most 5 false statements.' Statement 6 can be true if the number of true statements (5) is prime, but 5 is indeed prime. Statement 7 can be true because the number of false statements (2) is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 would be false.\n\n## Step 9: Check the consistency of Statement 4 being true with other statements\nIf Statement 4 is true, then we have 5 true statements. This makes Statement 1 true (since at least 6 is not met, it's a potential issue), Statement 2 true (since 2 false statements are at most 5), Statement 5 true (as explained), Statement 6 true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 false (since 2 is not composite). So, we have: Statement 1 (potentially false because it says at least 6), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (true), Statement 5 (true), Statement 6 (true), Statement 7 (false). This gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which matches Statement 4. Statement 1 is actually false because it claims at least 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 4 being true\nWith Statement 4 being true, we have: Statements 2, 4, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 1, 3, 7 are false. This configuration satisfies Statement 4 (5 true, 2 false) and is consistent.\n\n## Step 11: Check for other possible configurations\nLet's directly assess the validity of other statements and configurations. For instance, if Statement 1 is true, then at least 6 statements are true, which means either 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the case when 6 or 7 statements are true\nIf 7 statements are true, then all statements must be true, which is impossible because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true. If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, so one of them must be the false statement. If Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 could be true, making 5 true statements, which doesn't fit. If Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 could be true, making 2 true statements, which again doesn't fit having 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 13: Summarize findings\nWe've found that having Statement 4 true provides a valid configuration where 5 statements are true ( Statements 2, 4, 5, 6) and 2 are false (Statements 1, 3, 7). Let's verify if there are other configurations.\n\n## Step 14: Verify the prime and composite conditions\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. For 2 false statements, Statement 7 is false because 2 is prime, not composite.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Simplify Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false,' which is equivalent to saying 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This is because if you have 7 statements and at most 3 are false, then at least 4 must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 claims all 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be true because it says exactly 2 statements are false, which would be a contradiction. Thus, Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true. Statement 5 says exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the implications of Statement 5\nGiven Statement 5, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false. But if Statement 3 is true, it implies all statements are true, including Statement 4, which is a contradiction. So, Statement 3 must be false. Therefore, Statement 4 must be true because Statement 5 dictates that exactly one of them is true.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of true and false statements based on Statement 4\nSince Statement 4 is true, exactly 2 statements are false. This means 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Check if the number of true statements satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6\nWith 5 true statements, Statement 1 ('At least 3 of these 7 statements are true') is satisfied because 5 is greater than 3. Statement 6 ('The number of true statements is a prime number') is also satisfied because 5 is a prime number.\n\n## Step 7: Check if the number of false statements satisfies Statement 2 and Statement 7\nThere are 2 false statements. Statement 2 ('At most 3 of these 7 statements are false') is satisfied because 2 is less than 3. Statement 7 ('The number of false statements is a composite number') is not satisfied because 2 is not a composite number (it's a prime number).\n\n## Step 8: Verify the consistency of the statements with the determined number of true and false statements\nWe have 5 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6) and 2 false statements (Statement 3, Statement 7). Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because 5 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because having 2 false statements means at most 3 are false. Statement 3 is false, which is consistent. Statement 4 is true, confirming 2 false statements. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Count the number of possible solutions\nGiven the constraints and the analysis, we found one possible configuration where 5 statements are true and 2 are false. We need to check if there are other configurations.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze other potential configurations based on the statements\nLet's directly assess the validity of other potential numbers of true statements. For 7 true statements (as per Statement 3), it's not possible due to the contradiction it creates with Statement 4 and the falsity of Statement 7. For other numbers, we must check against all statements.\n\n## Step 11: Check the validity of having 5 true statements as the only possible solution\nSince we've established that having 5 true statements satisfies most conditions and is consistent with the given statements (except for Statement 7 being false, which is acceptable since it's one of the false statements), let's confirm if this is the only solution.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate if other numbers of true statements could be valid\nFor 4 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime, and Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. This gives us a potential configuration but we need to check all statements. Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4, both being false, making it false. So, we have 2 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2), which doesn't match our assumption of 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 13: Assess the outcome of the analysis\nWe've identified one valid configuration (5 true, 2 false) and need to verify if other configurations are possible.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 7 ('The number of false statements is a composite number') is not satisfied because 2 is not a composite number (it's a prime number).\n\n## Step 8: Verify the consistency of the statements with the determined number of true and false statements\nWe have 5 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6) and 2 false statements (Statement 3, Statement 7). Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because 5 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because having 2 false statements means at most 3 are false. Statement 3 is false, which is consistent. Statement 4 is true, confirming 2 false statements. Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Count the number of possible solutions\nGiven the constraints and the analysis, we found one possible configuration where 5 statements are true and 2 are false. We need to check if there are other configurations.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze other potential configurations based on the statements\nLet's directly assess the validity of other potential numbers of true statements. For 7 true statements (as per Statement 3), it's not possible due to the contradiction it creates with Statement 4 and the falsity of Statement 7. For other numbers, we must check against all statements.\n\n## Step 11: Check the validity of having 5 true statements as the only possible solution\nSince we've established that having 5 true statements satisfies most conditions and is consistent with the given statements (except for Statement 7 being false, which is acceptable since it's one of the false statements), let's confirm if this is the only solution.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate if other numbers of true statements could be valid\nFor 4 true statements: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime, and Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite. This gives us a potential configuration but we need to check all statements. Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4, both being false, making it false. So, we have 2 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2), which doesn't match our assumption of 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 13: Assess the outcome of the analysis\nWe've identified one valid configuration (5 true, 2 false) and need to verify if other configurations are possible.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For $F$, the composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims $T = 0$. If $T = 0$, then all statements are false. This would make Statement 3 true, which is a contradiction. Thus, $T$ cannot be 0, and Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the implications of Statement 3 being false on Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 is false, for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 4 must be true because Statement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Thus, if Statement 5 is true, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 states $T = 4$. If $T = 4$, then Statements 1, 2, 4, and 6 need to be true because Statement 4 is true and $T = 4$. Let's check if this satisfies all conditions.\n\n## Step 5: Check if $T = 4$ satisfies the conditions\n- Statement 1: True because $T = 4 \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 2: True because $F = 3 \\leq 5$.\n- Statement 4: True by assumption.\n- Statement 6: True if $T = 4$ is prime. $T = 4$ is not prime, so Statement 6 is false.

Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 3$ is not composite, it's false. So, we have Statements 1, 2, 4, 5 as true and Statements 3, 6, 7 as false, giving $T = 4$. This is a potential solution.\n\n## Step 8: Check other potential values of $T$ for validity\nLet's examine other possible $T$ values.\n- For $T = 7$, all statements must be true. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 6 is true because 7 is prime. Statement 7 is false because $F = 0$ is not composite. So, $T = 7$ is not valid because not all statements can be true.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze $T = 2, 3, 5$ for Statement 6\nFor $T$ to be prime (Statement 6), $T$ could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. We've already examined $T = 4$ and $T = 7$. Let's check $T = 2, 3, 5$.\n\n## Step 10: Detailed check for $T = 2, 3, 5$\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is true because $F = 5$. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 5$ is not composite. So, Statements 2, 6, 7 are true, and $T = 3$, which contradicts $T = 2$. Thus, $T = 2$ is not a solution.\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime. Statement 7 is false because $F = 4$ is composite. So, Statements 2, 6 are true, giving $T = 2$, which again contradicts $T = 3$. Thus, $T = 3$ is not a valid solution.\n- For $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 2$ is not composite. So, Statements 1, 2, 6 are true.

A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 (since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the statements together\nLet's start by checking the implications of Statements 1 and 2. If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 5 true statements. Statement 2 being true implies there are at least 6 true statements. Together, they suggest that if both are true, there must be exactly 6 or 7 true statements because Statement 2 is more restrictive.\n\n## Step 10: Check for consistency among statements\n- If Statement 3 is true (3 true statements), it contradicts Statements 1 and 2. So, Statement 3 being true would make Statements 1 and 2 false.\n- Statement 4 being true (6 true statements) is consistent with Statement 1 and Statement 2 being true because 6 is at least 5 and at most 1 false (which means 6 true).\n\n## Step 11: Examine the case when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 6 true because 6 is a prime number (no, it's not; 6 is not prime, it's composite, but this is a step to check consistency). Statement 7 would be false because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite. Statement 5 would be true if Statement 3 is false. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6 being potentially true, and Statement 3 and Statement 7 being false. However, we need to verify if this satisfies all conditions.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed check of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false to satisfy Statement 5. So, we have: Statement 1 (True), Statement 2 (True), Statement 3 (False), Statement 4 (True), Statement 5 (True because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 (False because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 (False because 1 is not composite). This gives us 4 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption that Statement 4 is true (implying 6 true statements). Thus, Statement 4 cannot be true under the condition that it claims.\n\n## Step 13: Check the validity of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false. For Statement 5 to be true, since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, it holds. We need to find 2 more true statements. Statement 1 is false because there are not at least 5 true statements. Statement 2 is false because there are more than 1 false statements. Statement 6 could be true if the number of true statements (3) is prime, which it is. Statement 7 could be true if the number of false statements (4) is composite, which it is. So, we have Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as potentially true. This gives us 4 true statements, not 3, so it doesn't satisfy Statement 3.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate the number of true statements based on prime and composite conditions\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6), meaning the number of true statements could be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 15: Combine the conditions\nLet's directly assess possible scenarios:\n- If 7 statements are true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. This scenario is inconsistent because Statement 7 is false (0 false statements is not composite).\n- If 6 statements are true, we've already seen this leads to inconsistencies.\n- If 5 statements are true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is false. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true (because at most 1 is false, i.e., 2 false), Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (2 false is not composite, so this doesn't work).\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

This implies that the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This means the number of false statements is 0 or 1, implying the number of true statements is 7 or 6.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states that 3 statements are true and 4 are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 6 statements are true and 1 is false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. We need to check the validity of this statement based on the truth values of Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 6 true because 6 is a prime number (no, it's not; 6 is not prime, it's composite, but this is a step to check consistency). Statement 7 would be false because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite. Statement 5 would be true if Statement 3 is false. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6 being potentially true, and Statement 3 and Statement 7 being false.

This gives us 4 true statements, which contradicts our initial assumption that Statement 4 is true (implying 6 true statements). Thus, Statement 4 cannot be true under the condition that it claims.\n\n## Step 13: Check the validity of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false. For Statement 5 to be true, since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, it holds. We need to find 2 more true statements. Statement 1 is false because there are not at least 5 true statements. Statement 2 is false because there are more than 1 false statements. Statement 6 could be true if the number of true statements (3) is prime, which it is. Statement 7 could be true if the number of false statements (4) is composite, which it is.

Statement 1 implies that at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 implies that at most 2 statements are false, meaning at least 5 statements are true. Statement 3 implies that 6 out of 7 statements are true. Statement 4 implies that 3 out of 7 statements are false, or 4 are true. Statement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 implies that the number of true statements is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7 since there are 7 statements). Statement 7 implies that the number of false statements is a composite number (4 or 6 since there are 7 statements, and 0 is not considered composite).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are true, which means Statement 4 is false because it states that exactly 3 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are true, and Statement 3 is false. Statement 5 states that exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. So, if Statement 5 is true, it supports the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the case when Statement 3 is true.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 6 out of 7 statements are true. This means Statement 4 is false. For Statement 3 to be true, 6 statements must be true, so Statement 5 must also be true because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and in this case, Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Let's check the other statements: Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false (1 is false). Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite, but this is a special case since 1 is neither prime nor composite. However, having 6 true statements contradicts Statement 6 being true, so this scenario is not possible if we consider Statement 6.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements when Statement 3 is true and its implications.\nGiven Statement 3 is true, we have 6 true statements. This makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 7 true, and Statement 4 and Statement 6 false. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true (at least 2 true), Statement 2 is true (at most 2 false), Statement 3 is true (6 true), Statement 4 is false (not 3 false), Statement 5 is true (Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is false (6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (1 is not composite). This gives us 5 true statements, not 6, so Statement 3 being true leads to a contradiction because it requires 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the case when Statement 4 is true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, and 4 are true. Statement 3 is false because it claims 6 statements are true. Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Let's analyze the other statements: Statement 1 is true because at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false is not met (3 are false), so it's false. Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements (4) is prime, but 4 is not prime. So, Statement 6 is false. Statement 7 is true because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements when Statement 4 is true.\nWith Statement 4 being true, we have: Statement 1 true, Statement 2 false, Statement 3 false, Statement 4 true, Statement 5 true, Statement 6 false, and Statement 7 true. This gives us 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 7) and 3 false statements (Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 6), which matches the condition of Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 7: Check if the number of true statements satisfies Statement 6.\nSince 4 is not a prime number, Statement 6 is false, which is consistent with our findings.\n\n## Step 8: Verify if the scenario satisfies all conditions.\nWe have 4 true statements and 3 false statements. Statement 1 is satisfied (at least 2 true). Statement 2 is not satisfied (more than 2 false). Statement 3 is not satisfied (not 6 true). Statement 4 is satisfied (exactly 3 false). Statement 5 is satisfied (Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false). Statement 6 is not satisfied (4 is not prime). Statement 7 is satisfied (3 is not composite, but this is a valid scenario because it doesn't contradict the truthfulness directly; however, it's worth noting 3 is not composite).\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 further for the scenario where Statement 4 is true.\nStatement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is true because it states the number of false statements (3) is composite, but 3 is not composite; it's prime. So, actually, Statement 7 should be false because 3 is not composite.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the statements with the correct understanding of Statement 7.\nIf Statement 4 is true, and we have 4 true statements, the correct count is: Statement 1, Statement 4, Statement 5 are true. For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements should be composite. Since we have 3 false statements, and 3 is prime, not composite, Statement 7 is false. So, the true statements are Statement 1, Statement 4, and Statement 5, making 3 true statements and 4 false statements, which does not satisfy Statement 4.\n\n## Step 11: Reconsider the initial analysis for a valid solution.\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements that satisfy all given conditions and statements.\n\n## Step 12: Checking for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6).\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate each possible prime number of true statements.\n- For 2 true statements: Statement 1 can be true. Other statements need to be evaluated for consistency.\n- For 3 true statements: This matches Statement 4. We need to check if it's possible.\n- For 5 true statements: Statement 2 is true (at most 2 false), and it could be a possibility.\n- For 7 true statements: All statements must be true, which is not possible because some statements contradict each other.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's understand and possibly simplify the given statements.\n- Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 5.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 4, or T >= 3.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies T = 1.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies F = 5, or T = 2.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers are numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, F could be 4, 6 (since 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 are not composite).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Statement 5\nStatement 3 (T = 1) and Statement 4 (T = 2) cannot both be true due to Statement 5. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, and vice versa.\n- If Statement 3 is true (T = 1), then it must be the only true statement. This contradicts Statement 1 (T >= 5) being true. So, Statement 3 being true leads to a contradiction because Statement 1 cannot be true if T = 1.\n- If Statement 4 is true (T = 2), then Statement 3 is false. This means we have at least one true statement (Statement 4) and one false statement (Statement 3), so T = 2 and F = 5.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nLet's first check if Statement 3 can be true. If T = 1, then only Statement 3 is true, and the rest are false. This makes Statement 1 false (because T = 1 is not >= 5), Statement 2 false (because F = 6 is not <= 4), Statement 4 false (because T is not 2), Statement 5 false (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, but it says either or, not both, which is true, so this is a contradiction), Statement 6 false (T = 1 is not prime), and Statement 7 true (F = 6 is composite). This scenario is impossible because Statement 7 being true contradicts our assumption that only Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the scenario when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then T = 2. This means Statement 3 is false. So, we have Statement 4 as one true statement. Let's examine the other statements.\n- Statement 1: T >= 5. This is false because T = 2.\n- Statement 2: F <= 4. This is false because F = 5.\n- Statement 5: Since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, we have our second true statement.\n- Statement 6: T = 2 is prime, so this is true. But we already have T = 2 from Statement 4 and Statement 5 being true, which contradicts because we can't have three true statements.\n- Statement 7: F = 5 is not composite, it's prime, so this is false.\n\n## Step 5: Check for consistency with T = 2\nWe found that if Statement 4 is true, then T = 2. With Statement 4 and Statement 5 being true, we satisfy T = 2. However, this creates a contradiction with Statement 6 because if T = 2, then Statement 6 is indeed true, making T = 3, which is not consistent with our initial assumption of T = 2 based on Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate other possible values of T based on Statement 1 and Statement 6\nLet's directly check the possible values of T that satisfy both Statement 1 and Statement 6.\n- For T = 5 or T = 7, Statement 1 is satisfied.

This implies that the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 5.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that the number of false statements (F) is less than or equal to 4, or T >= 3.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies T = 1.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies F = 5, or T = 2.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers are numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, F could be 4, 6 (since 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 are not composite).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Statement 5\nStatement 3 (T = 1) and Statement 4 (T = 2) cannot both be true due to Statement 5. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, and vice versa.\n- If Statement 3 is true (T = 1), then it must be the only true statement. This contradicts Statement 1 (T >= 5) being true. So, Statement 3 being true leads to a contradiction because Statement 1 cannot be true if T = 1.\n- If Statement 4 is true (T = 2), then Statement 3 is false. This means we have at least one true statement (Statement 4) and one false statement (Statement 3), so T = 2 and F = 5.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nLet's first check if Statement 3 can be true. If T = 1, then only Statement 3 is true, and the rest are false. This makes Statement 1 false (because T = 1 is not >= 5), Statement 2 false (because F = 6 is not <= 4), Statement 4 false (because T is not 2), Statement 5 false (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, but it says either or, not both, which is true, so this is a contradiction), Statement 6 false (T = 1 is not prime), and Statement 7 true (F = 6 is composite). This scenario is impossible because Statement 7 being true contradicts our assumption that only Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the scenario when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then T = 2. This means Statement 3 is false. So, we have Statement 4 as one true statement. Let's examine the other statements.\n- Statement 1: T >= 5. This is false because T = 2.\n- Statement 2: F <= 4. This is false because F = 5.\n- Statement 5: Since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, we have our second true statement.\n- Statement 6: T = 2 is prime, so this is true. But we already have T = 2 from Statement 4 and Statement 5 being true, which contradicts because we can't have three true statements.\n- Statement 7: F = 5 is not composite, it's prime, so this is false.\n\n## Step 5: Check for consistency with T = 2\nWe found that if Statement 4 is true, then T = 2. With Statement 4 and Statement 5 being true, we satisfy T = 2. However, this creates a contradiction with Statement 6 because if T = 2, then Statement 6 is indeed true, making T = 3, which is not consistent with our initial assumption of T = 2 based on Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate other possible values of T based on Statement 1 and Statement 6\nLet's directly check the possible values of T that satisfy both Statement 1 and Statement 6.\n- For T = 5 or T = 7, Statement 1 is satisfied. For T = 5, F = 2, and for T = 7, F = 0.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied if T is prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n## Step 7: Check for T = 5 and T = 7\n- For T = 5, F = 2. Statement 7 is false because F = 2 is prime, not composite.\n- For T = 7, F = 0. Statement 7 is false because F = 0 is not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Detailed check for T = 5\nIf T = 5, then 5 statements are true.\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because F = 2.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false, so \"either or but not both\" is false, which means Statement 5 is actually false. This is a contradiction.\n- Statement 6 is true because T = 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because F = 2 is not composite.\n\n## Step 9: Detailed check for T = 7\nIf T = 7, then all statements are true.\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is true, which contradicts because if Statement 3 is true, T should be 1.\n- This scenario is impossible because Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 10: Check for T = 3\nFor T = 3, F = 4. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime, and Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\nLet's see if we can have 3 true statements.\n- Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 can be true, satisfying T = 3.\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5's truth value depends on Statement 3 and Statement 4.

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze each statement to understand what it implies about the truthfulness of the other statements. Statement 1 implies that at least 7 out of 7 statements are true. Statement 2 implies that at most 2 out of 7 statements are false, which means at least 5 statements are true. Statement 3 states that exactly 2 statements are true. Statement 4 states that exactly 4 statements are false, meaning 3 statements are true. Statement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1.\nStatement 1 says 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This means all 7 statements must be true. If all 7 are true, then Statement 3 (Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true) and Statement 4 (Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false) cannot be true because they contradict the condition that all statements are true. Thus, if Statement 1 is true, it leads to a contradiction with Statements 3 and 4 being true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 1.\nGiven that Statement 1 being true leads to a contradiction because Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true if Statement 1 is true, Statement 1 cannot be true. Therefore, not all 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 2.\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 5 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then it supports the idea that a significant number of statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the implications of Statement 2 being true.\nIf Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true. This means Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true because Statement 3 says exactly 2 are true (which contradicts Statement 2) and Statement 4 says exactly 4 are false (meaning 3 are true, which also contradicts Statement 2 if we consider it alongside other true statements). Statement 5's truthfulness depends on the truth values of Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 6: Assess Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 says exactly 2 statements are true. If true, then Statement 4 must be false because it says exactly 4 statements are false (implying 3 are true). Statement 4 being false supports Statement 5 being true if Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 says exactly 4 statements are false, so 3 are true. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate Statement 5.\nStatement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, and vice versa. This means if Statement 5 is true, it allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true exclusively.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the scenarios based on Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. The true statements could be Statement 3 and Statement 5 (since Statement 5 can be true if Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false). However, we need to check if this satisfies all conditions. If Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements are true. This could potentially satisfy some conditions but needs further examination.\n\n## Step 9: Check the number of true statements based on prime (Statement 6) and composite (Statement 7) conditions.\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze possible truth values for the statements based on the conditions.\nLet's directly check the possibilities:\n- If Statement 1 is true, all statements are true, which is impossible due to the contradictions it creates.\n- For Statement 2 to be true, at least 5 statements must be true. Let's check if this can be satisfied.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed examination of Statement 2 being true.\nIf Statement 2 is true, and at least 5 statements are true, then:\n- Statement 3 cannot be true because it says exactly 2 are true.\n- Statement 4 cannot be true because it says exactly 4 are false, implying 3 are true.\n- Statement 5 would be false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Statement 6 needs to be checked for the number of true statements being prime.\n- Statement 7 needs the number of false statements to be composite.\n\n## Step 12: Checking for possible solutions.\nLet's consider the number of true statements:\n- If 5 or 6 statements are true (because of Statement 2), Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) can be true if the number of true statements is 5 (since 5 is prime).\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the case where 5 statements are true.\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. The false statements could be Statement 3 and Statement 4 (since they cannot both be true and are likely candidates to be false given Statement 2 is true). Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) is false because 2 is not composite. So, we have: Statement 1 (false), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 (true because 5 is prime), and Statement 7 (false because 2 is not composite). This gives us 5 true statements (Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and two more need to be true), which matches our condition.\n\n## Step 14: Checking if the scenario satisfies all given conditions.\nFor 5 true statements: Statements 2, 5, 6 are true. We need 2 more true statements. Statement 1 is false. If Statement 4 is false, Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite), which fits. So, possible true statements could be Statements 2, 5, 6, and any other two. However, we need to ensure Statement 7's condition is met or not. For 2 false statements, Statement 7 is false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements and their implications.\nFirst, let's analyze each statement: Statement 1 claims at least 7 out of 7 statements are true. Statement 2 claims at most 2 out of 7 statements are false. Statement 3 claims exactly 5 out of 7 statements are true. Statement 4 claims exactly 2 out of 7 statements are false. Statement 5 claims either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1.\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements must be true. This implies that Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are all true. However, if all statements are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they claim different numbers of true statements (5 and 5, respectively, since 2 false out of 7 means 5 true). This contradiction suggests we need to examine the truthfulness of Statement 1 more closely in relation to other statements.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 1 being true.\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true. This means Statement 2 is true (at most 2 false statements), which is consistent with all being true (0 false statements). Statement 3 and Statement 4 both being true is impossible because they contradict each other ( Statement 3 says 5 true, Statement 4 says 5 true, which is the same, but this is a special case). However, Statement 5 cannot be true if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true because it states that exactly one of them should be true. Thus, Statement 1 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 1 based on the analysis.\nGiven the contradiction found in Step 3, Statement 1 cannot be true because it leads to a scenario where Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 would be true if all statements were true), which contradicts the premise that all statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 2.\nStatement 2 says at most 2 statements are false. This means at least 5 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then it supports the possibility of 5 or more statements being true.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the relationship between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (5 true statements or 2 false statements), so they are equivalent. Statement 5 says exactly one of them is true, but since they are equivalent, this creates a problem because if one is true, the other is also true, making it impossible for Statement 5 to be true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the implications of Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true.\nIf Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true. This implies that Statement 5 is false because it cannot be the case that exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true since they are equivalent.\n\n## Step 8: Assess the truthfulness of the statements based on the number of true statements.\nLet's consider the cases where 5 statements are true (as per Statement 3 and Statement 4). If 5 statements are true, then Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) is false because 2 is not composite (it's prime).\n\n## Step 9: Check the consistency of having 5 true statements.\nIf 5 statements are true, then Statement 1 is false (since not all 7 are true), Statement 2 is true (since at most 2 are false), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true), Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). So, we have: Statement 1 (F), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (T), Statement 4 (T), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (F). This gives us 4 true statements, not 5, which contradicts our initial assumption.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the statements for other possible numbers of true statements.\nLet's directly check the statements for possible configurations. For 5 true statements: Statement 1 (F), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (T), Statement 4 (T), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (F) is not valid because it results in 4 true statements. We need to check other configurations.\n\n## Step 11: Check for other possible configurations.\nLet's analyze the statements again with different numbers of true statements. For instance, if 4 statements are true, then Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. We need to systematically check the validity of each statement against possible configurations.\n\n## Step 12: Systematically evaluate possible configurations.\n- For 7 true statements: Contradicts Statement 5.\n- For 6 true statements: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (since 6 is not prime, this is false), Statement 7 is false (since 1 is not composite). So, we have 2 true statements (Statement 2 and Statement 5), which does not match our assumption of 6 true statements.\n- For 5 true statements: As analyzed, it's not possible.\n- For other numbers, we need to check the prime condition (Statement 6) and composite condition (Statement 7).\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check for specific numbers of true statements.\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of different numbers of true statements:\n- If 2 statements are true, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite. Statement 6 is false because 2 is prime, so it actually supports this scenario. We need to find a configuration that works.\n\n## Step 14: Analyze the case where 2 statements are true.\nIf 2 statements are true, Statement 4 is true. For Statement 7 to be false (since 5 is not composite), it's consistent. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. So, one possible configuration could be: Statement 1 (F), Statement 2 (F), Statement 3 (F), Statement 4 (T), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (F), which gives us 2 true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Statement 3 and Statement 4 both being true is impossible because they contradict each other ( Statement 3 says 5 true, Statement 4 says 5 true, which is the same, but this is a special case). However, Statement 5 cannot be true if both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true because it states that exactly one of them should be true. Thus, Statement 1 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 1 based on the analysis.\nGiven the contradiction found in Step 3, Statement 1 cannot be true because it leads to a scenario where Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 would be true if all statements were true), which contradicts the premise that all statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 2.\nStatement 2 says at most 2 statements are false. This means at least 5 statements are true. If Statement 2 is true, then it supports the possibility of 5 or more statements being true.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the relationship between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (5 true statements or 2 false statements), so they are equivalent. Statement 5 says exactly one of them is true, but since they are equivalent, this creates a problem because if one is true, the other is also true, making it impossible for Statement 5 to be true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the implications of Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true.\nIf Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true. This implies that Statement 5 is false because it cannot be the case that exactly one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true since they are equivalent.\n\n## Step 8: Assess the truthfulness of the statements based on the number of true statements.\nLet's consider the cases where 5 statements are true (as per Statement 3 and Statement 4). If 5 statements are true, then Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) is false because 2 is not composite (it's prime).\n\n## Step 9: Check the consistency of having 5 true statements.\nIf 5 statements are true, then Statement 1 is false (since not all 7 are true), Statement 2 is true (since at most 2 are false), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true), Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). So, we have: Statement 1 (F), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (T), Statement 4 (T), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (F). This gives us 4 true statements, not 5, which contradicts our initial assumption.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the statements for other possible numbers of true statements.\nLet's directly check the statements for possible configurations. For 5 true statements: Statement 1 (F), Statement 2 (T), Statement 3 (T), Statement 4 (T), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (F) is not valid because it results in 4 true statements. We need to check other configurations.\n\n## Step 11: Check for other possible configurations.\nLet's analyze the statements again with different numbers of true statements. For instance, if 4 statements are true, then Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. We need to systematically check the validity of each statement against possible configurations.\n\n## Step 12: Systematically evaluate possible configurations.\n- For 7 true statements: Contradicts Statement 5.\n- For 6 true statements: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false), Statement 6 is true (since 6 is not prime, this is false), Statement 7 is false (since 1 is not composite). So, we have 2 true statements (Statement 2 and Statement 5), which does not match our assumption of 6 true statements.\n- For 5 true statements: As analyzed, it's not possible.\n- For other numbers, we need to check the prime condition (Statement 6) and composite condition (Statement 7).\n\n## Step 13: Detailed check for specific numbers of true statements.\nLet's directly assess the feasibility of different numbers of true statements:\n- If 2 statements are true, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 7 is false because 5 is not composite. Statement 6 is false because 2 is prime, so it actually supports this scenario. We need to find a configuration that works.\n\n## Step 14: Analyze the case where 2 statements are true.\nIf 2 statements are true, Statement 4 is true. For Statement 7 to be false (since 5 is not composite), it's consistent. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. So, one possible configuration could be: Statement 1 (F), Statement 2 (F), Statement 3 (F), Statement 4 (T), Statement 5 (F), Statement 6 (T), Statement 7 (F), which gives us 2 true statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This implies that all 7 statements must be true because there are only 7 statements in total. If all 7 are true, then Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 5 of the 7 statements must be true. If Statement 2 is true, then it allows for the possibility of 0, 1, or 2 false statements among the 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.' This statement implies that all statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then it directly supports Statement 1 being true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that 2 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then it means that out of the 7 statements, 5 are false, and 2 are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' If Statement 3 is true (meaning all statements are true), then Statement 4 cannot be true because it says 5 statements are false. However, if Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false. We need to examine the truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 to assess Statement 5.\n\n## Step 6: Examine the Truthfulness of Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true, which means Statement 4 is also true. However, this contradicts Statement 5 because Statement 5 requires that only one of them is true. Thus, if Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 cannot be true. On the other hand, if Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false, which aligns with Statement 5 being true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 3 Together\nIf Statement 3 is true, then all 7 statements are true. This makes Statement 1 true. For Statement 2, if all 7 statements are true, then 0 statements are false, which satisfies 'at most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Thus, Statement 2 is also true under this condition.\n\n## Step 8: Check the Consistency of Statements When All Are True\nIf all statements are true (as per Statement 3), then:\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because 0 (the number of false statements) is at most 2.\n- Statement 3 is true by assumption.\n- Statement 4 is true, which is a contradiction because it says exactly 5 statements are false.\nThus, the scenario where all statements are true is not possible due to the contradiction with Statement 4.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are false, and 2 are true. Statement 3 must be one of the false statements because it claims all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the Implications of Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then:\n- Statement 1 must be false because it says at least 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 must be false because it says at most 2 statements are false, but we have 5 false statements.\n- Statement 3 is false, as established.\n- Statement 5 must be true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, satisfying the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 (the number of true statements is a prime number) needs evaluation. With 2 true statements, this is true because 2 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 (the number of false statements is a composite number) needs evaluation. With 5 false statements, this is true because 5 is not a composite number (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 11: Check the Consistency of Statements When Statement 4 is True\nLet's list the statements and their truth values when Statement 4 is true:\n- Statement 1: False\n- Statement 2: False\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: True (because 2 is prime)\n- Statement 7: False (because 5 is not composite)\n\nThis gives us 3 true statements (Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6) and 4 false statements, which contradicts our initial assumption that exactly 2 statements are true when Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 12: Re-evaluate the Statements for Possible Combinations\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements and see which statements can be true or false.\n\n## Step 13: Checking for Prime Number of True Statements (Statement 6)\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. We need to check these possibilities.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluating the Number of True Statements\nFor 7 true statements, we've established a contradiction.\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 3 is false. This scenario is plausible because it satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false) being true if we have 5 true statements. However, we need to check all statements.\n\n## Step 15: Detailed Check for 5 True Statements\nIf 5 statements are true:\n- Statement 1 could be true or false depending on the exact count.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 2 are false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite.\n\nLet's assume Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6 are true (3 true so far), and Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 7 are false (4 false so far), which gives us a total of 3 true and 4 false statements.

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime (out of 7) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'

This implies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true, and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false, and here 1 is false.\n- Statement 3 is true as assumed.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, this creates a contradiction.\n\n## Step 8: Check the validity of Statement 3 being true\nSince Statement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number and 6 is not prime, Statement 3 being true leads to a contradiction because it implies Statement 6 is true, but 6 is not prime.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the scenario with Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true.\n- This implies Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, satisfying the condition of Statement 5.\n- We need to check the consistency of other statements.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the truthfulness of statements when Statement 4 is true\nLet's assume Statement 4 is true, so 4 statements are true.\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 are false, and here 3 are false.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- For 4 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because 3 is not composite, it's a contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Detailed check for Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then we have:\n- True statements: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5 (4 statements).\n- False statements: Statement 3, Statement 6, Statement 7 (3 statements).\nThis setup makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 5 true.\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6 is false, which is consistent with our count (4 true statements, and 4 is not prime).\n- Statement 7 is false, which is consistent because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 12: Verify the consistency of the solution where Statement 4 is true\nWith Statement 4 being true, we have a consistent solution where 4 statements are true (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5) and 3 are false (Statement 3, Statement 6, Statement 7). This satisfies all conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means $T \\geq 3$, where $T$ is the number of true statements.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies $F \\leq 3$, where $F$ is the number of false statements. Since $T + F = 7$, it means $T \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' So, $T = 4$.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means $T = 4$ because $F = 3$ and $T + F = 7$.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 4$, if either is true, the other must be true, making this statement false because it contradicts the condition that only one of them can be true.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' This means $T$ must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7 since $T$ cannot be greater than 7).\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For $F$, this means $F$ could be 4 or 6 since $F = 7 - T$ and $T$ cannot be 0 or 1 for Statement 1 to be potentially true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 both assert $T = 4$, Statement 5 is false because it states that only one of them can be true. Thus, $T$ cannot be such that it makes both Statement 3 and Statement 4 true and Statement 5 false in a way that satisfies all other conditions. However, we already know Statement 5 is false.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of $T = 4$\nIf $T = 4$, then both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true. This satisfies Statement 1 ($T \\geq 3$) and Statement 2 ($T \\geq 4$ is satisfied as $T = 4$). For $T = 4$, Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is true because $F = 3$ is not composite, it's false. So, we have $T = 4$ making Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 true. Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness for $T = 4$\nFor $T = 4$, we have:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: False\n- Statement 6: False\n- Statement 7: False\nThis gives us $T = 4$, which matches the assertions of Statement 3 and Statement 4.

Possible values for $T$ are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- For $T = 2$, Statement 1 is false. Statement 2 is true because $F = 5$ and $F \\leq 3$ is false, so Statement 2 is actually false. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 5$ is not composite in the context of being a prime number, but it's actually not composite; it's prime, so Statement 7 is false. So, we have $T = 2$ (Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, Statement 7 is false), giving $T = 3$, which doesn't match.\n- For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is false because $F = 4$ is composite. So, $T = 4$ (Statement 1 true, Statement 2 true, Statement 3 false, Statement 4 false, Statement 5 true, Statement 6 true, Statement 7 false), which gives $T = 4$, not matching $T = 3$.\n- For $T = 5$, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is true because $F = 2$ is not composite. So, we have (Statement 1 true, Statement 2 false, Statement 3 false, Statement 4 false, Statement 5 true, Statement 6 true, Statement 7 false), resulting in $T = 4$, not $T = 5$.\n- For $T = 7$, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is true. Statement 7 is false because $F = 0$ is not composite. So, $T = 5$ (Statement 1 true, Statement 2 true, Statement 3 false, Statement 4 false, Statement 5 true, Statement 6 true, Statement 7 false), which doesn't match $T = 7$.\n\n## Step 6: Detailed check for $T = 2, 3, 5, 7$\nLet's directly assess the validity of $T$ being 2, 3, 5, or 7 by checking the statements.\n- For $T = 2$: (False, False, False, False, True, True, False) = 3, which doesn't match.\n- For $T = 3$: (True, True, False, False, True, True, False) = 4, which doesn't match.\n- For $T = 5$: (True, False, False, False, True, True, False) = 4, which doesn't match.\n- For $T = 7$: (True, True, False, False, True, True, False) = 5, which doesn't match.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion on possible solutions\nFrom the steps above, $T = 4$ is a valid configuration where Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4 are true, and Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are false.

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, we need to understand and possibly simplify the given statements. Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 3: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' Statement 4: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.' Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 implies that 6 or 7 statements are true. If 7 statements are true, then all statements must be true. If 6 statements are true, then exactly 1 statement is false.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 implies that 5 or more statements are true because it states that at most 2 statements are false. This means 5, 6, or 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 states that exactly 6 statements are true, which means 1 is false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 states that all 7 statements are true, which is a direct claim.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true or false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true. Statement 4 being false supports this because it means not all statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 being true. Thus, Statement 5 is true if one of them is true and the other is false.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the truthfulness based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all statements are true. This would make Statement 3 false because it claims exactly 6 are true. Statement 5 would be true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, satisfying the condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, is not met. So, if Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is actually false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true at the same time, creating a contradiction.\n\n## Step 9: Check the scenario where Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true. This makes Statement 4 false. Statement 1 is true because at least 6 statements are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 statements are false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 needs to be checked: if 6 statements are true, then the number of true statements (6) is not prime, so Statement 6 is false. Statement 7: if 1 statement is false, then the number of false statements is 1, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false. This gives us 5 true statements ( Statements 1, 2, 3, 5) and 2 false (Statements 4, 6 or 7), which does not satisfy Statement 3.\n\n## Step 10: Re-evaluate the statements for possible solutions\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and analyze the statements.\n\n## Step 11: Checking for the number of true statements\n- If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false. But Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, not both, so this creates a contradiction because both cannot be true, and Statement 5 is false if Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. Thus, not all statements can be true.\n- For exactly 6 true statements, Statement 3 is true. This implies Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true. We need to check other statements.\n\n## Step 12: Detailed check for exactly 6 true statements\nIf Statement 3 is true, and exactly 6 statements are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\nThis gives us Statements 1, 2, 3, 5 as true and Statements 4, 6, 7 as false, which matches exactly 4 true statements, not 6.\n\n## Step 13: Checking the condition for 5 true statements\nIf 5 statements are true, then Statement 1 is false because it says at least 6 are true. Statement 2 is true because at most 2 are false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. We need to find a combination that works.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluating Statement 6 and Statement 7 for 5 true statements\nFor 5 true statements, Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 2 (the number of false statements) is composite is false, but 2 is not considered composite in some definitions, however, it's actually not composite. So, Statement 7 is false.\n\n## Step 15: Checking the validity of 5 true statements\nLet's assume Statements 2, 5, 6 are true. Then, we need 2 more true statements. If Statement 1 is false, Statement 3 or Statement 4 being false doesn't help. But if we consider Statement 2, 5, 6 as true, and Statement 7 is false (because 2 is not composite), we can try to fit. Statement 1 is false, Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false. So, Statements 2, 5, 6 are true, and the rest are false, giving us 3 true statements, not 5.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

This means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true, and it satisfies its own condition. However, we need to check other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that at least 2 statements must be true because if 5 or fewer statements are false, then 2 or more must be true. If all 7 statements are true, Statement 2 is also true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' If Statement 3 is true, then it must be one of the 3 true statements, meaning 2 other statements are true. We need to check if this can be consistent with other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which creates a paradox because Statement 4 cannot be true if all statements are false. Thus, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 4 is false (from Step 4), for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 3 must be true. This means exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 6: Check Consistency with Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. Statement 5 is also true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. We now have 2 true statements.

Statement 2 allows for up to 5 false statements, so it is true. Now we have 3 true statements: Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 5.\n\n## Step 9: Check Statement 6 and Statement 7 with 3 True Statements\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' With 3 true statements, this is true because 3 is a prime number. Statement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' With 4 false statements, this is true because 4 is a composite number.\n\n## Step 10: Verify the Consistency of Statements\nWe have Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as potentially true.

So, we actually have 5 true statements, not 3, which contradicts our initial assumption based on Statement 3.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluate the Statements for Other Possible Solutions\nGiven the contradiction found, let's directly assess the truthfulness of statements. Since Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and Statement 4 is false, so Statement 3 must be true for Statement 5 to be true), we have a starting point.\n\n## Step 12: Assess the Possibility of Exactly 3 True Statements Again\nIf exactly 3 statements are true (Statement 3 is true), and we've identified that Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 could potentially be true or false based on different conditions, we need to directly check the conditions. Statement 3 being true implies 3 true statements. We've already seen that having Statement 3 true leads to a potential inconsistency when trying to satisfy all conditions simultaneously because it leads to 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 13: Check for Other Possible Combinations\nLet's directly analyze the statements: If Statement 1 is true, all statements must be true, which is not possible because Statement 4 is false. Thus, Statement 1 is false.\n\n## Step 14: Analyze the Statements Again with New Insights\nSince Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 being true means Statement 3 must be true. But if Statement 3 is true, we have a contradiction as shown before because it leads to more than 3 true statements being possible.\n\n## Step 15: Final Evaluation\nLet's consider the number of true statements based on prime and composite conditions. Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) give us clues. For 7 statements, possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, 7. Composite numbers of false statements (thus, true statements being 7 minus a composite number) give us possibilities like 3 (7-4), 2 (7-5), or 0 (7-7), but 0 is not prime.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements.\n- Statement 1: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that not all statements can be false.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 2 statements must be true because if 5 or more are false, it violates this statement.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states the number of true statements.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that exactly 4 statements are true, which is the same as Statement 3.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (4 true statements), this statement creates a contradiction if either is true because they cannot be true or false independently in a way that satisfies this statement.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' This means the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4, 6 (since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent because they both imply that 4 out of the 7 statements are true. Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, since they are equivalent, if one is true, the other is also true, making it impossible for Statement 5 to be true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. Thus, if Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 must be false.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 3 (or Statement 4) is true, then exactly 4 statements are true. This means Statement 5 must be false because it cannot be that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. So, we have at least 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4), and Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 and Statement 7 need to be examined for consistency with 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 6 and Statement 7 when 4 statements are true\nWith 4 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number. With 4 true statements, there are 3 false statements, making Statement 7 false because 3 is not a composite number. So, we have 4 true (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4) and 3 false (Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7), which is consistent with Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the scenario where 4 statements are true satisfies all conditions\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 5 statements are false (3 are false).\n- Statement 3 is true, stating exactly 4 are true.\n- Statement 4 is true, stating exactly 3 are false (or 4 are true).\n- Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our analysis.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\nThis scenario is consistent.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze other possible numbers of true statements based on Statement 6\nStatement 6 suggests the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). Let's examine these cases.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the case where the number of true statements is 2 (a prime number)\nIf 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false because more than 5 statements are not false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, satisfying the condition that either is true but not both. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as potentially true, but this contradicts our assumption that only 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 8: Examine the case where the number of true statements is 3 (a prime number)\nIf 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. This makes Statement 1 true, Statement 2 true, and Statement 7 true (because 4 is composite), which already gives us 3 true statements. Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are false. This scenario is plausible because it satisfies the condition of having 3 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Examine the case where the number of true statements is 5 (a prime number)\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. For Statement 6 to be true, we need 5 true statements, which is prime. Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3 (or Statement 4), and Statement 6 are potentially true. However, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 5 must be false. This gives us at least 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6), which is 5 true statements. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. This scenario is possible.\n\n## Step 10: Examine the case where the number of true statements is 7 (a prime number)\nIf all 7 statements are true, then Statement 5 is false because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, creating a contradiction.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the given statements\nFirst, let's analyze and possibly simplify the given statements.\n- Statement 1: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that not all statements can be false.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that at least 2 statements must be true because if 5 or more are false, it violates this statement.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states the number of true statements.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that exactly 4 statements are true, which is the same as Statement 3.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially say the same thing (4 true statements), this statement creates a contradiction if either is true because they cannot be true or false independently in a way that satisfies this statement.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' This means the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4, 6 (since 0 is not considered composite and 1 is not composite).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 are equivalent because they both imply that 4 out of the 7 statements are true. Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, since they are equivalent, if one is true, the other is also true, making it impossible for Statement 5 to be true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. Thus, if Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 must be false.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 3 (or Statement 4) is true, then exactly 4 statements are true. This means Statement 5 must be false because it cannot be that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. So, we have at least 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4), and Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 and Statement 7 need to be examined for consistency with 4 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the truthfulness of Statement 6 and Statement 7 when 4 statements are true\nWith 4 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number. With 4 true statements, there are 3 false statements, making Statement 7 false because 3 is not a composite number. So, we have 4 true (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4) and 3 false (Statement 5, Statement 6, Statement 7), which is consistent with Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 5: Check if the scenario where 4 statements are true satisfies all conditions\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 1 statement is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 5 statements are false (3 are false).\n- Statement 3 is true, stating exactly 4 are true.\n- Statement 4 is true, stating exactly 3 are false (or 4 are true).\n- Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our analysis.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\nThis scenario is consistent.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze other possible numbers of true statements based on Statement 6\nStatement 6 suggests the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). Let's examine these cases.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the case where the number of true statements is 2 (a prime number)\nIf 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false because more than 5 statements are not false. Statement 3 is false. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, satisfying the condition that either is true but not both. Statement 6 is true because 2 is prime. Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite. So, we have Statement 1, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as potentially true, but this contradicts our assumption that only 2 statements are true.\n\n## Step 8: Examine the case where the number of true statements is 3 (a prime number)\nIf 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. This makes Statement 1 true, Statement 2 true, and Statement 7 true (because 4 is composite), which already gives us 3 true statements. Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are false. This scenario is plausible because it satisfies the condition of having 3 true statements.\n\n## Step 9: Examine the case where the number of true statements is 5 (a prime number)\nIf 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. For Statement 6 to be true, we need 5 true statements, which is prime. Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3 (or Statement 4), and Statement 6 are potentially true. However, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 5 must be false. This gives us at least 4 true statements (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6), which is 5 true statements. Statement 7 is false because 2 is not composite. This scenario is possible.\n\n## Step 10: Examine the case where the number of true statements is 7 (a prime number)\nIf all 7 statements are true, then Statement 5 is false because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, creating a contradiction. Thus, not all 7 can be true.\n\n## Step 11: Summarize findings\n- Having exactly 4 true statements is a valid solution.\n- Having exactly 3 true statements is a valid solution (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 7 true; others false).\n- Having exactly 5 true statements is not valid upon closer inspection because it leads to inconsistencies with the statements themselves, particularly with Statement 5 being false and the implications of other statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2</answer>",

This implies that the number of true statements is 6 or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that the number of false statements is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Consequently, the number of true statements is 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states that 3 statements are true and 4 are false.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'

If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa. This statement's truth value depends on the truth values of Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, the number of false statements could be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements could be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the possible number of true statements based on the statements\nLet's examine the implications of each statement on the number of true statements and check for consistency.\n\n## Step 10: Check Statement 1 and Statement 2 together\nIf Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements. Statement 2 allows for 2 to 7 true statements. So, both can be true if there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n## Step 11: Examine the truth value of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 says there are 3 true statements, and Statement 4 says there are 6 true statements. Statement 5 indicates that only one of them can be true.\n\n## Step 12: Check the consistency of the statements\n- If Statement 3 is true (3 true statements), then Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because only Statement 3 is true. This gives us 3 true statements (Statements 3, 5, and potentially others), which contradicts Statement 3 being one of the true statements unless it's part of a valid configuration.\n- If Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), then Statement 3 is false. For Statement 4 to be true, there must be 1 false statement. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, which fits if there are 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the number of true statements based on Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 suggests the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements is composite (4 or 6), implying 3 or 1 true statements.\n\n## Step 14: Analyze the scenarios based on the number of true statements\n1. If there are 7 true statements, Statement 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 are true. Statement 3 is false, and Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false. This scenario is plausible because it satisfies Statement 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 being true, and Statement 3 is the false one, making 6 true statements, not 7. So, it's not valid for 7 true statements.\n2. If there are 6 true statements, Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are potentially true. Statement 4 being true means there's 1 false statement. Statement 7 is false because 1 is not composite. This gives a valid configuration: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 3 and 7 are false.\n\n## Step 15: Check for valid configurations\nLet's directly check the validity of having 6 true statements as it satisfies several conditions: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 are true. Statement 3 is false (because it says exactly 3 are true), and Statement 7 is false (because 1 is not composite). So, we have Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 true and Statements 3, 7 false, which is 5 true statements, not 6. This was an error in step assumption.\n\n## Step 16: Re-evaluate the statements for a valid configuration\nFor 6 true statements: Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and potentially others. If Statement 4 is true, then there's 1 false statement. This could be a valid scenario if we can satisfy all other conditions.\n\n## Step 17: Detailed check for 6 true statements\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true. This makes Statement 1 true. For Statement 2 to be true, at most 5 statements can be false, which is satisfied. Statement 5 is true if Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is true because 6 is not prime, this is a problem. So, having exactly 6 true statements doesn't work because Statement 6 is false.\n\n## Step 18: Check for other possible configurations\nLet's check the configuration where Statement 3 is true (3 true statements). This implies Statements 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 are not all true because they imply different numbers of true statements.\n\n## Step 19: Analyze the case for 3 true statements\nIf Statement 3 is true, then there are 3 true statements. Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 could be true if the number of true statements is 3, which is prime. Statement 7 could be true if the number of false statements is 4, which is composite.\n\n## Step 20: Validate the configuration for 3 true statements\nFor 3 true statements: Statements 3, 5, and 6 are true. Statement 7 is also true because there are 4 false statements, which is composite. So, Statements 3, 5, 6, and 7 are true, which gives us 4 true statements, not 3.

Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' We need to understand that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself, and a composite number is a number greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the statements into mathematical expressions\nLet's denote the number of true statements as $T$ and the number of false statements as $F$. Thus, $T + F = 7$. Statement 1: $T \\geq 2$. Statement 2: $F \\leq 4$, which implies $T \\geq 3$. Statement 3: $T = 5$. Statement 4: $F = 2$, which implies $T = 5$. Statement 5: This statement implies that either $T = 5$ or $T = 5$ is true but not both, which seems to be a contradiction because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply $T = 5$. Statement 6: $T$ is a prime number. Statement 7: $F$ is a composite number.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that $T = 5$. Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This creates a contradiction because if either is true, $T = 5$, and thus both are true, which violates Statement 5. Therefore, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must be false to satisfy Statement 5.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4 being false\nSince Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, $T \\neq 5$. This means $T$ could be any other value from 0 to 7, except 5.

This implies $T = 5$ is not true, so $T \\neq 5$. Let's check other statements. Since $T \\neq 5$, we have to see which other statements can be true or false.\n\n## Step 6: Check the validity of other statements when $T \\neq 5$\nGiven $T + F = 7$, if $T = 5$ is false, possible values for $T$ are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. Statement 1 ($T \\geq 2$) is false if $T = 0$ or $T = 1$. Statement 2 ($T \\geq 3$) is false if $T = 0, 1, 2$. Statement 6 ($T$ is prime) is true for $T = 2, 3, 5, 7$. Since $T = 5$ is not valid, $T = 2, 3, 7$ are the possible prime values. Statement 7 ($F$ is composite) is true if $F = 4, 6$ because $F = 7 - T$, so $T = 3, 1$ respectively. $F = 4$ when $T = 3$, and $F = 6$ when $T = 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the possible values of $T$ based on the statements\nFor $T = 2$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false because $F = 5$ is not composite. For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true because $F = 4$ is composite. For $T = 7$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false because $F = 0$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Check the consistency of the statements for possible $T$\nFor $T = 2$: Statements 1, 5, 6 are true; Statements 2, 3, 4, 7 are false. This gives $T = 3$, which is inconsistent. For $T = 3$: Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 are true; Statements 3, 4 are false. This gives $T = 5$, which is consistent with the number of true statements being 5. For $T = 7$: Statements 1, 5, 6 are true; Statements 2, 3, 4, 7 are false. This gives $T = 3$, which is inconsistent.\n\n## Step 9: Verify the consistency for $T = 3$\nWhen $T = 3$, the true statements are 1, 2, 5, 6, 7. This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because $T = 3 \\geq 2$. Statement 2 is true because $F = 4 \\leq 4$. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 6 is true because $T = 3$ is prime.

This implies $T = 5$ is not true, so $T \\neq 5$. Let's check other statements. Since $T \\neq 5$, we have to see which other statements can be true or false.\n\n## Step 6: Check the validity of other statements when $T \\neq 5$\nGiven $T + F = 7$, if $T = 5$ is false, possible values for $T$ are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. Statement 1 ($T \\geq 2$) is false if $T = 0$ or $T = 1$. Statement 2 ($T \\geq 3$) is false if $T = 0, 1, 2$. Statement 6 ($T$ is prime) is true for $T = 2, 3, 5, 7$. Since $T = 5$ is not valid, $T = 2, 3, 7$ are the possible prime values. Statement 7 ($F$ is composite) is true if $F = 4, 6$ because $F = 7 - T$, so $T = 3, 1$ respectively. $F = 4$ when $T = 3$, and $F = 6$ when $T = 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the possible values of $T$ based on the statements\nFor $T = 2$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is false because $F = 5$ is not composite. For $T = 3$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true because $F = 4$ is composite. For $T = 7$, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false because $F = 0$ is not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Check the consistency of the statements for possible $T$\nFor $T = 2$: Statements 1, 5, 6 are true; Statements 2, 3, 4, 7 are false. This gives $T = 3$, which is inconsistent. For $T = 3$: Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 are true; Statements 3, 4 are false. This gives $T = 5$, which is consistent with the number of true statements being 5. For $T = 7$: Statements 1, 5, 6 are true; Statements 2, 3, 4, 7 are false. This gives $T = 3$, which is inconsistent.\n\n## Step 9: Verify the consistency for $T = 3$\nWhen $T = 3$, the true statements are 1, 2, 5, 6, 7. This means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true. Let's verify: Statement 1 is true because $T = 3 \\geq 2$. Statement 2 is true because $F = 4 \\leq 4$. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false. Statement 6 is true because $T = 3$ is prime. Statement 7 is true because $F = 4$ is composite.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

We have 7 statements, and we need to determine the number of possible solutions based on their truthfulness.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 says, 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.' This implies that either 6 or 7 statements are true. If 6 statements are true, then Statement 1 is one of them, which is possible. If 7 statements are true, then Statement 1 is also true, which is consistent.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says, 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that either 0 or 1 statement is false. If 0 statements are false, all 7 are true. If 1 statement is false, then 6 are true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says, 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly implies that 1 statement is false and 6 are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says, 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'

For Statement 5 to be true, either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n\n## Step 7: Examine the implications of Statement 3 being true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true. This implies Statement 1 is true (since at least 6 are true), Statement 2 is true (since at most 1 is false), and Statement 4 is false (since not exactly 5 are false). Statement 5 being true means Statement 4 is false, which is consistent. We need to check the truthfulness of Statements 6 and 7. If 6 statements are true, then Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, but this needs verification. Actually, 6 is not prime, so Statement 6 would be false if 6 statements are true. Statement 7 would be false because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Check the consistency of Statements 1 through 7 when Statement 3 is true\nIf Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are true. This makes Statement 1 true, Statement 2 true, Statement 3 true, Statement 4 false, Statement 5 true (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 false (because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 false (because 1 is not composite). So, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 5 as true and Statements 4, 6, 7 as false, which gives us 4 true statements, not 6. This contradicts our initial assumption that Statement 3 is true.\n\n## Step 9: Examine the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are false, and 2 are true. This means Statement 3 is false. For Statement 5 to be true, since Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false, which is consistent.\n\n## Step 10: Check the consistency when Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true and 5 are false. Statement 1 is false because not at least 6 are true. Statement 2 is false because more than 1 statement is false. Statement 3 is false because not exactly 6 are true. Statement 4 is true. Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is false if 2 statements are true because 2 is prime, so it's actually true. Statement 7 is true because 5 is composite. So, Statements 4, 6, and 7 are true, and Statements 1, 2, 3, 5 are false. This gives us 3 true statements, not 2, which contradicts our assumption.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluate the statements for possible truth values\nLet's directly check the possible number of true statements based on the given conditions and verify which statements can be true or false.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the prime and composite conditions\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 6 is false because 7 is prime, so this scenario is impossible. If there are 6 true statements, Statement 6 is false because 6 is not prime.\n\n## Step 13: Check for the number of true statements being prime (Statement 6)\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7). We've already seen that having 7 true statements makes Statement 6 false, which is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 14: Consider the case where Statement 4 is true and its implications\nIf Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true. For Statement 6 to be true, 2 is indeed prime, so this is a valid scenario for Statement 6.\n\n## Step 15: Evaluate the truthfulness based on the number of true statements\nLet's consider the possible number of true statements and check which statements can be true.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

If it's false, then there are fewer than 3 true statements, meaning 2 or fewer.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies all 7 statements are true because there are at most 0 false statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' If true, then exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means exactly 4 statements are true because 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Since Statement 3 and Statement 4 both imply that exactly 4 statements are true, they are essentially saying the same thing, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false if we consider their implications. Thus, Statement 5 being true would create a contradiction because it demands one of them to be true and the other false.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible number of true statements being prime means it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements being composite means it could be 4 or 6 because these are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7 (since 7 - true statements = false statements).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the implications of Statement 2 being true\nIf Statement 2 is true, then all statements are true. This would mean Statement 5 is true, which is a problem because Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true, contradicting Statement 5. Thus, Statement 2 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the truthfulness of Statement 1\nGiven Statement 2 is false, we know not all statements are true. Statement 1 being true means at least 3 statements are true.\n\n## Step 11: Examine the scenario where Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true\nBoth Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply 4 true statements. If either is true, the other must be true as well because they both state the same condition (4 true statements), which contradicts Statement 5. Thus, if Statement 5 is true, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## Step 12: Check for consistency across statements\nLet's check the possible number of true statements based on the statements. If Statement 3 is true, then 4 statements are true. Statement 4 being true also means 4 statements are true. Statement 6 being true with 4 true statements is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 being true with 3 false statements (since 4 are true) is true because 3 is not composite.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate possible solutions based on Statement 6 and Statement 7\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6), meaning the number of true statements must be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 14: Check for valid configurations\n- If 7 statements are true (Statement 2 is true), it's not valid due to the contradiction with Statement 5.\n- For 5 true statements, Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 6 are true. This configuration is not valid because Statement 3 and Statement 4 being true contradicts Statement 5.\n- For 4 true statements, Statements 1, 3, 4, and 7 could be true, but this contradicts Statement 5.\n- For 3 true statements, Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 could potentially be true. Statement 1 is true, Statement 6 is true because 3 is prime, and Statement 7 is true because 4 is composite.\n\n## Step 15: Detailed check for 3 true statements\nIf Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true: At least 3 statements are true, which is satisfied.\n- Statement 2 is false: At most 0 statements are false, which is not satisfied, so it's correctly false.\n- Statement 3 is false: Exactly 4 statements are true, which is not the case.\n- Statement 4 is false: Exactly 3 statements are false, which is true (4 true statements would be false, but 3 false and 4 true is not the case here; it's actually 4 false and 3 true).\n- Statement 5 is false: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Since both are false, Statement 5 is actually true, which creates a contradiction.\nThus, having Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7 as true does not work because it makes Statement 5 true, not false.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

This means the number of true statements (T) is greater than or equal to 4.\n- Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that T is greater than or equal to 5 because if there are at most 2 false statements, there are at least 5 true statements.\n- Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly states T = 5.\n- Statement 4: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false.' This means T = 1.\n- Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This implies that either T = 5 or T = 1, but not both.\n- Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, the number of false statements (F) could be 4 or 6, meaning T could be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 implies T \u2265 4, and Statement 2 implies T \u2265 5. If Statement 2 is true, then Statement 1 is also true because if T \u2265 5, then T \u2265 4.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the implications of Statement 3 and Statement 4\nStatement 3 implies T = 5, and Statement 4 implies T = 1. According to Statement 5, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, we have two cases to consider based on Statement 5: (1) T = 5 and Statement 4 is false, or (2) T = 1 and Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the case when T = 5\nIf T = 5, then Statement 3 is true. Statement 4 must be false because Statement 5 is true (since either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both). Let's check the truthfulness of other statements:\n- Statement 1 is true because T = 5 \u2265 4.\n- Statement 2 is true because T = 5 \u2265 5.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because F = 2 (since T = 5), and 2 is not a composite number.\n\n## Step 5: Check if T = 5 satisfies all conditions\nWith T = 5, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 as true, and Statements 4 and 7 as false. This gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which matches our assumption. So, T = 5 is a valid solution.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the case when T = 1\nIf T = 1, then Statement 4 is true. Statement 3 must be false. Let's examine the truthfulness of other statements:\n- Statement 1 is false because T = 1 is not \u2265 4.\n- Statement 2 is false because T = 1 is not \u2265 5.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 1 is not considered a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because F = 6, and 6 is a composite number.\n\n## Step 7: Check if T = 1 satisfies all conditions\nWith T = 1, we have Statements 4, 5, and 7 as potentially true. However, we need exactly 1 true statement. Statement 4 being true satisfies the condition for T = 1. But we need to check if this configuration is valid:\n- If Statement 4 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 must be false. However, Statement 5 being false means both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are either true or false together, which contradicts our initial condition that Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false unless Statement 5 is also false. Statement 7 being false (because F = 6 is composite, so it's actually true) doesn't fit. So, we have a contradiction because if Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 should be false (since Statement 3 is false), but then we cannot satisfy T = 1 with just Statement 4 being true because Statement 7 is also true.\n\n## Step 8: Detailed examination for T = 1\nLet's correct the analysis for T = 1:\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- For T = 1, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 6 are false.\n- Statement 5 is true if Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, which is the case here. However, this creates a problem because we now have at least 2 true statements (Statement 4 and Statement 5), which contradicts T = 1.\n- Statement 7 is true because F = 6 is composite.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate the validity of T = 1\nGiven that Statement 4 and Statement 7 are true, and Statement 5 is also true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, we have at least 3 true statements, which contradicts the condition T = 1. Thus, T = 1 is not a valid solution upon detailed examination.\n\n## Step 10: Consider other possible values of T based on Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 implies T is 2, 3, 5, or 7. Statement 7 implies T is 1 or 3.

We need one more true statement. Let's examine the statements again:\n- For T = 3, we have Statements 6 and 7 as true.
