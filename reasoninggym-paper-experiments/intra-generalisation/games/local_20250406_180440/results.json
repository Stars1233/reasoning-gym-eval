The \"Peng\" condition requires two identical cards to be added, while the \"Chi\" condition looks for a new card that can form a consecutive sequence with two existing cards. Since the \"Peng\" condition takes precedence, I should first check for \"Peng\" after each addition. If no \"Peng\" is formed, I then check for \"Chi\". The order of operations and the specific cards in hand will influence the outcome of each round. By systematically analyzing each round, I can determine the final result.</think>\n<answer>Peng</answer>",

I should check for two identical cards in hand that match the newly added card to determine if it's a \"Peng\". Additionally, I need to look for a sequence of three consecutive cards that could result in a \"Chi\". The order of operations is important, as the presence of certain cards can affect the outcome of subsequent rounds. For example, if a \"Chi\" condition is met early in the sequence, it will override any later \"Peng\" conditions. I will go through each round, updating the hand of cards and checking for the specified patterns.

I can start by listing the cards after each operation to keep track. Initially, there are 13 cards. Then, I will check after each addition and removal if the \"Peng\" or \"Chi\" conditions are satisfied. Specifically, I need to look for cases where two identical cards are in hand and a new card adds to a sequence of three consecutive cards. The order of operations is important, so I will consider the state of the deck after each round to determine the result. For example, after adding a card that completes a sequence or forms a pair, I need to check if this results in a \"Peng\" or \"Chi\". Finally, I will conclude with the result that has the highest precedence.</think>\n<answer>Peng</answer>",
