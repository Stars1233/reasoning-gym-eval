I will generate the sequence of moves by applying the recursive function for 4 disks, ensuring that each move adheres to the rules of the game.</think>\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n</answer>",

I will list each move step-by-step to ensure all conditions are met.</think>\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk",

For 4 disks, the solution will involve a series of steps that ensure no larger disk is placed on top of a smaller one. I will break down the solution into a series of moves, keeping track of the state of each disk and peg. The key is to use one of the pegs as a temporary holding area to move all disks to the target peg while adhering to the rules. I will start by moving the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the largest disk to the target peg, and finally move the 3 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

The sequence of moves will be carefully planned to minimize the total number of steps and to correctly transfer all disks from the starting peg to the target peg using the auxiliary pegs.</think>\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n</answer>",
