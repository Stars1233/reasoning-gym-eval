From clue 6:\n- Desert smoothie drinker is in House 1 (left of House 2 where Bella's parent is)\n\n3. From clues 7:\n- Blue lover is left of Purple lover\n- This can only be Houses 3 and 4\n\n4. From clue 1:\n- Alice's parent is left of Arnold\n- Since we have constraints, this must mean Arnold is in House 4\n\n5. From clue 3:\n- Timothy's mother is left of brown lover\n- Since Arnold is in House 4, he must love brown\n- This means Timothy's mother is in House 3\n\n6. Working through remaining clues:\n- House 1: Alice's parent, Desert smoothie, not white (as Bob drinks Darkness)\n- House 2: Bella's parent\n- House 3: Timothy's mother, blue lover\n- House 4: Arnold, brown lover, purple lover\n\n7. Since Bob loves white and drinks Darkness, and Carol drinks Dragonfruit, Alice's parent in House 1 must be Alice.\n</think>\n<answer>alice</answer>",
