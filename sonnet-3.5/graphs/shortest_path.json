Using BFS to explore all possible paths:\n   - Can move up, down, left, right\n   - Can only move through 'O' cells\n   - Keep track of visited cells and the path taken\n\n3. BFS exploration from (2,6):\n   - Moving left: (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (2,1)\n   - From (2,1) can go up: (1,1) -> (0,1)\n   - From (0,1) can go down: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1)\n\n4.
