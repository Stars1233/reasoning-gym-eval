      "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n2. If the string suffix is 'cc', replace it with 'b' and prepend 'a' to the start.\n3. If the string prefix is 'aa', remove the first character.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nExample:\n- Input:\n    - String: abbac\n    - Rules:\n        1. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n        2. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n        3. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n- Output: bbbacc\n- Explanation:\n    - In the first iteration, rule 1 is applied to the string abbac, resulting in cabac\n    - In the second interation, rule 1 doesn't apply, but rule 2 is applied to the string cabac, resulting in bbbacc\n    - In the third iteration, none of the rules (1, 2, 3) apply, so the process is terminated, and the final answer is bbbacc\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nccbaabaabaacaccaccbb\n",
