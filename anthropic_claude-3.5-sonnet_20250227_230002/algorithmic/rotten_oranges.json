I'll continue this process until either:\n   - All fresh oranges become rotten\n   - No more oranges can be rotted\n\n5. Looking at the grid:\n   - There are multiple initial rotten oranges scattered throughout\n   - The grid is mostly connected with fresh oranges\n   - All fresh oranges have a path to at least one rotten orange\n   - The farthest fresh orange can be reached by the rotting process\n\n6.

For each minute:\n   - Spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges\n   - Keep track of minutes elapsed\n4. After BFS:\n   - Check if any fresh oranges remain\n   - If yes, return -1\n   - If no, return minutes elapsed\n\nLooking at this 25x25 grid:\n- Has several rotten oranges (2's) scattered throughout\n- Fresh oranges (1's) are reachable from rotten ones\n- Through BFS traversal, all fresh oranges will eventually be reached\n\n<answer>8</answer>",
