The sum in the right column must work.\n\n3) Working with the constraints and trying possibilities:\n   - Since B is leftmost in BWZZ, it can't be 0\n   - Z appears multiple times\n   - Addition in each column must work with carries\n\n4) Testing systematically with the constraints and working through the addition...\n\n<answer>Z=6,I=5,W=4,R=3,S=2,A=7,Y=8,B=1,X=7,K=4,</answer>",
