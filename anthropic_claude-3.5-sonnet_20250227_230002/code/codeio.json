Your task is to calculate the number of distinct ways to climb the staircase, where each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. Return the number of distinct ways as an integer.\n\nThe input and output requirements are as follows:\n\nInput:\n    number_of_steps (int): The number of steps on the staircase. Must be a positive integer.\n\nOutput:\n    return (dict): A dictionary with one key:\n    - distinct_ways (int): The number of distinct ways to climb the staircase.\n\nGiven the following input:\n\n{'number_of_steps': 51}\n\nCan you predict the output without writing any code? Please think and then provide the exact output in the form of a JSON object as your final answer. The keys and values of the object should strictly match the output requirement as specified.\n\nTip: Here is a reference code snippet for this question. You can refer to this code to guide your reasoning but not copy spans of code directly.\n\ndef main(number_of_steps):\n    assert isinstance(number_of_steps, int) and number_of_steps > 0, (\n        f\"number_of_steps needs to be positive integer, your input {number_of_steps}\"\n    )\n    if number_of_steps == 1:\n        return {\"distinct_ways\": 1}\n    previous, current = 1, 1\n    for _ in range(number_of_steps - 1):\n        current, previous = current + previous, current\n    return {\"distinct_ways\": current}\n",
