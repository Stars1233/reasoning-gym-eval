      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: The first step is to look for any patterns or commonalities between the input and output grids in the provided examples. \n\n2. **Example Analysis**:\n   - **Example 1**: The input contains a mix of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The output seems to replace all occurrences of 1 with 2, and all other numbers (0s and 2s) with 0, except for the first few positions which are all 2s. However, upon closer inspection, the rule isn't simply replacing numbers but seems to be related to the positions and possibly the counts of certain numbers.\n   - **Example 2 & 3**: Similar observations can be made, but the direct replacement rule doesn't hold consistently across all examples when considering the position and distribution of numbers.\n\n3. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - Upon re-examining the examples, it seems the initial observation might have been misleading. Let's consider the distribution and count of numbers:\n     - In **Example 1**, the output starts with a sequence of 2s followed by 0s and then 1s. This doesn't directly correlate with the input in a straightforward replacement manner.\n     - In **Example 2 & 3**, similar patterns are observed but with variations in the sequence lengths.\n   - A potential rule could involve the count or proportion of certain numbers in the input grid and how they are redistributed in the output grid.\n\n4. **Reevaluating the Rule**:\n   - Let's consider if the rule involves counting the occurrences of each number (0, 1, 2) in the input grid and then using these counts to generate the output grid.\n   - **Counting Occurrences**:\n     - For each example, count the occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 in the input grid.\n     - **Example 1**: 0s = 8, 1s = 5, 2s = 10\n     - **Example 2**: 0s = 10, 1s = 4, 2s = 8\n     - **Example 3**: 0s = 12, 1s = 5, 2s = 6\n   - **Generating Output**:\n     - The output seems to start with 2s, followed by 0s, and ends with 1s. The number of 2s could be related to the count of 2s in the input, the number of 0s in the output could be related to the counts of 0s or the combination of 0s and 1s, and the 1s could be related to the count of 1s.\n   - However, upon closer inspection, the rule seems more straightforward than initially thought: the output grid consists of the most frequent number in the input grid repeated, followed by the second most frequent, and then the least frequent.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - **Test Input**: 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0\n   - **Counts**: 0s = 14, 1s = 3, 2s = 6\n   - The most frequent number is 0, followed by 2, and then 1.\n   - Thus, the output should start with 0s (since it's the most frequent), followed by 2s, and end with 1s.\n\nGiven the total length of the input grid is 23, and the counts of 0s, 1s, and 2s are 14, 3, and 6 respectively, the output grid should consist of 0s (14 times), followed by 2s (6 times), and then 1s (3 times), because 0 is the most frequent, followed by 2, and then 1.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid, following the identified rule, would be filled with the most frequent number (0) first, then the next most frequent (2), and the least frequent (1) last, based on their counts in the input grid.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Identifying Patterns**: Looking at the examples, it seems the rule involves shifting or modifying the position of non-zero elements within the grid. In Example 1, the non-zero elements (4 4) move to the left. In Example 2, the non-zero elements (9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9) seem to shift to the left as well, but since they were already at the left edge, the shift is not as apparent as in Example 1. In Example 3, the non-zero elements (2 2) move to the left.\n\n2. **Understanding the Shift**: The shift seems to be two positions to the left for the first non-zero element encountered from the left. However, this observation might not fully explain Example 2, where the sequence of 9s doesn't shift in the same apparent way as the other examples. A closer look reveals that the first two elements of the sequence of 9s move to the left, replacing the initial zeros, which suggests a rule that involves moving the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left until it hits the boundary of the grid.\n\n3. **Formulating the Rule**: Based on these observations, the rule could be formulated as follows: Identify the first occurrence of a non-zero number from the left. Shift this sequence of non-zero numbers as far to the left as possible, effectively moving the leading zeros over the trailing zeros or empty space if the sequence is at the end.\n\n4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`, applying the rule involves shifting the sequence of `1`s to the left. The sequence of `1`s starts at the 12th position and goes to the 21st position. According to the rule, we shift this sequence of `1`s to the left, starting from the first position.\n\n5. **Predicting the Output**: Following the rule, the output would be `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. This is because we move the sequence of `1`s to the left, replacing the initial zeros, and the rest of the positions are filled with zeros as per the original grid's length.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

The sequence of 7s, which is the next distinct non-zero number, expands to fill the space between the 2 and the next distinct number (which is also 7 in this case), effectively replacing the 0 immediately after the 2 with a 7. The 7s then continue until the end of the sequence, and the last number becomes 0.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis**:\n   - Input: 2 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n   - Observation: Similar to Example 1, the first non-zero number (2) stays in place. The sequence of 6s, being the next distinct non-zero number, expands to fill the space between the 2 and itself, replacing the 0 immediately after the 2 with a 6. The 6s then continue until the end, and the last number becomes 0.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis**:\n   - Input: 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: Here, the numbers 8 and 2 are both non-zero and distinct. They remain in their places. There's no expansion of numbers because the next distinct number after 2 is not present (all are zeros), so the zeros remain unchanged, and there's no rule application that alters the output from the input in terms of number expansion.\n\nFrom these observations, we can derive a rule:\n- The first occurrence of each distinct non-zero number in the sequence remains in its place.\n- If a zero is immediately after a non-zero number, and the next distinct non-zero number is found later in the sequence, the zero is replaced by the next distinct non-zero number, effectively expanding the sequence of that non-zero number to fill the gap.\n- The last number in the sequence becomes 0, unless the entire sequence ends with zeros, in which case the rule about expanding non-zero sequences does not apply, and the output remains the same as the input.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input grid:\n- Input: 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\n- The first distinct non-zero number is 9, which fills the first part of the sequence.\n- The zeros after the sequence of 9s are followed by a 2, which is the next distinct non-zero number.\n- According to the rule, the zeros between the 9s and the 2 should be replaced by the next distinct non-zero number, which is 2.\n- Therefore, the output should have the 9s followed by 2s (replacing the zeros), and since 2 is the last distinct non-zero number, it expands to fill the space until the end, but the very last number becomes 0 according to the observed rule.\n\n<answer>9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2 2 2 0</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: The first step is to look for any patterns or changes from the input to the output grids. In all examples, the numbers 0 and 2 are used. The number 8 appears in the output grids but not in the input grids, suggesting that the rule involves transforming certain instances of 2 into 8 under specific conditions.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Looking closely at the examples, we can observe that the transformation of 2 into 8 seems to occur when a 2 is at the start of a sequence of 2s in a row or when it's the first 2 after a sequence of 0s. This observation suggests that the rule might involve identifying sequences of 2s and transforming the leading 2(s) of these sequences into 8s.\n\n3. **Testing the Rule**: Applying this potential rule to the examples:\n   - **Example 1**: The input starts with five 2s, which according to our rule, should be transformed into 8s because they are at the beginning of the sequence. The next sequence of 2s after the zeros also starts with 2s, which should be transformed. This matches the output provided.\n   - **Example 2**: The first sequence of 2s starts with a single 2, which should be transformed into an 8. The next sequence of 2s starts after zeros and also begins with a 2, which should be transformed into an 8. This aligns with the output.\n   - **Example 3**: The first sequence of 2s starts with two 2s after zeros, which should both be transformed into 8s according to our rule. The second sequence of 2s also starts after zeros with two 2s, which should be transformed. This matches the provided output.\n\n4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input grid \"2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", we apply the derived rule:\n   - The first sequence of five 2s should have their leading 2s transformed into 8s, resulting in \"8 8 2 2 2\".\n   - After the zeros, the next sequence of 2s starts with two 2s, which should be transformed into 8s, giving \"8 8 2\".\n   - The rest of the grid remains unchanged as there are no more sequences of 2s after zeros.\n\nTherefore, applying the rule to the test input grid, we get the output grid as \"8 8 2 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\n<answer>8 8 2 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observation of Patterns**: The first step is to look for any patterns or shifts in the numbers from the input grid to the output grid. In Example 1, we notice that the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid appears to shift to the left in the output grid, with the last non-zero number moving to the beginning of the sequence, and the first non-zero number moving to the end of the sequence. However, the zero numbers seem to maintain their position relative to the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n2. **Analysis of Zeroes**: The next step is to understand how zeroes are handled. In all examples, zeroes that precede the first sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid seem to remain in their positions in the output grid. Similarly, zeroes that follow the last non-zero number in the input grid also maintain their positions in the output grid.\n\n3. **Deriving the Rule**: Based on the observations, the rule appears to be that the sequence of non-zero numbers is rotated or shifted to the left by one position, while the zeroes at the beginning and end of the input grid remain unchanged. This means the first non-zero number in the input grid moves to the end of the sequence of non-zero numbers in the output grid, and the last non-zero number in the input grid moves to the beginning of the sequence of non-zero numbers in the output grid.\n\n4. **Testing the Rule**: Let's apply this rule to the examples provided to ensure it holds true.\n   - **Example 1**: Input `0 0 0 9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0`, the non-zero sequence is `9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4`. Applying the rule, we rotate this sequence to get `1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 9`, which matches the output when considering the leading and trailing zeroes.\n   - **Example 2**: Input `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8 0`, the non-zero sequence is `8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8`. Applying the rule, we rotate this sequence to get `1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8 8`, which matches the output when considering the leading and trailing zeroes.\n   - **Example 3**: Input `0 0 0 0 0 9 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`, the non-zero sequence is `9 3 2 2 1 1`. Applying the rule, we rotate this sequence to get `3 2 2 1 1 9`, which matches the output when considering the leading and trailing zeroes.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7`, the sequence of non-zero numbers is `1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7`. Applying the rotation rule, we move the last non-zero number to the beginning and the first non-zero number to the end of the sequence, resulting in `7 7 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4`. However, this explanation mistakenly described the rotation process incorrectly in relation to the provided examples. The correct application of the observed rule from the examples should directly shift the non-zero sequence without altering the positions of the zeroes relative to the non-zero sequence's original position. Thus, correctly applying the rule as observed in the examples, we should consider how the non-zero sequence `1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7` is treated. The correct rotation based on the initial misunderstanding of the rule's application would actually align with moving the last element of the non-zero sequence to the front, but given the correct interpretation from the examples, we should reconsider the rule's application based on the provided examples' patterns.\n\nGiven the misunderstanding in the explanation of the rotation process and to correct the approach based on the provided examples:\n- The correct approach should involve identifying the sequence of non-zero numbers and applying the shift as observed in the examples. The examples suggest that the sequence of non-zero numbers is shifted to the left, with the last non-zero number moving to the beginning of the sequence. Therefore, for the test input `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7`, the non-zero sequence is `1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7`. The last number `7` moves to the beginning, and the sequence becomes `7 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7`. The zeroes before and after the non-zero sequence remain in place.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7</answer>",

Count the total number of 1s and 2s: There are 4 ones and 2 twos, making a total of 6.\n2. The output starts with 2s for each 1 and 2: Since we have a total of 6 (4 ones + 2 twos), we start with 2s. However, the exact distribution in the examples suggests starting with two 2s, then adjusting based on the input's 1s and 2s distribution.\n3. Fill the rest with zeros until the end, where we place the 1s: The number of 1s at the end equals the total count of 1s and 2s in the input, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, applying the observed pattern:\n- Start with two 2s (as seen in the examples for the initial output pattern).\n- Fill the middle with zeros.\n- End with 1s equal to the total count of 1s and 2s (which is 6 in this case).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1</answer>",

This structure suggests that the rule might involve operations that consider the grid's dimensions or the positions of elements within the grid.\n\n2. **Identifying Patterns**: \n   - **Example 1**: The input has a block of 8s in the first row and a solid block of 8s in the second and subsequent rows except for the first three columns. The output moves the first three 8s from the first row to the second row, creating a continuous block of 8s from the top-left to the bottom-right, excluding the middle columns which remain 0.\n   - **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, but with the number 4. The input has a block of 4s in the first row and a solid block of 4s in the second and subsequent rows except for the first four columns. The output shifts the block of 4s from the first row to fill in the gap in the second row, maintaining a continuous block of 4s.\n   - **Example 3**: Here, the input starts with a single 7, followed by zeros, and then a solid block of 7s. The output shifts the initial 7 to create a continuous block of 7s from the top-left, excluding the middle columns which are zeros.\n\n3. **Deriving the Rule**: From these observations, the common rule appears to involve shifting or moving elements from the first row to subsequent rows in such a way that it creates a continuous block or pattern of the non-zero number, while maintaining the position of zeros as barriers or separators.\n\n4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - The test input grid is: `4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4`\n   - Following the observed pattern, the rule would shift the initial block of 4s to fill in the gap and create a continuous block of 4s, while keeping the zeros in their positions as separators.\n\nGiven this analysis, applying the rule to the test input should result in a grid where the initial block of 4s is shifted to create a continuous pattern with the rest of the 4s, respecting the zeros as barriers.\n\n<answer>4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4</answer>",

The input grid contains a sequence of zeros followed by a sequence of twos and then more zeros. The output grid shifts the sequence of twos to the left by three positions, filling the right side with zeros. This suggests that the rule might involve shifting non-zero elements to the left.\n\n2. **Example 3 Analysis**: In this example, the input contains a sequence of zeros, followed by a sequence of eights, and then more zeros. The output shifts the sequence of eights to the left, similar to Example 1 and 2, but the shift amount seems to be different. Here, it appears that the sequence of eights is shifted to fill the leftmost positions of the output grid up to the point where the sequence of eights started in the input grid.\n\nGiven these observations, the common rule seems to be that the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid is shifted to the left to start as early as possible in the output grid, effectively moving the non-zero sequence to the leftmost available positions without changing its length.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\nInput: 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the observed rule, we shift the sequence of sevens (the non-zero numbers) to the left.

The correct observation should note that leading zeros are increased by one in the output, effectively shifting all elements one position to the right, including the first occurrence of non-zero elements.\n\nFrom these observations, the common rule appears to be that the entire sequence of numbers in the input grid shifts one position to the right in the output grid.

However, considering the grid as a whole, it seems the non-zero elements (4s in this case) are \"moving\" towards the center, but given the structure, it's more about the zeros moving or the significant elements (4s) spreading out or shifting.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis**:\n   - Input:  6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Observation: Here, the single zero in the input grid seems to have moved to the left, creating a \"gap\" or \"shift\" in the sequence of 6s.

However, the key observation is the zeros moving or the pattern of non-zeros adjusting around them.\n\n**Deriving the Rule**:\nFrom the observations, the common rule doesn't seem to directly relate to the values of the non-zero elements but rather to their positions and the positions of the zeros. The rule appears to involve a shift or redistribution of elements based on the placement of zeros and non-zeros. However, upon closer inspection, a simpler, more consistent rule can be observed:\n\n- The rule seems to involve the first and last occurrences of zeros in the input grid. Specifically, the first zero moves to the right, and the last zero moves to the left in the output grid compared to their positions in the input grid.\n\nGiven this rule, let's apply it to the test input grid:\n\nInput: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n- The first zero is at position 8 (counting from 1).\n- The last zero is at position 9.\n\nApplying the rule:\n- The first zero moves to the right, so it should be at position 9 in the output.\n- The last zero moves to the left, so it should be at position 8 in the output.\n\nThus, the output grid, considering the movement of zeros, would be:\n\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 becomes 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 for the first part, adjusting the rest accordingly to fit the observed rule.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid is:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n<answer>2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</answer>",

At first glance, the outputs seem to be simplified versions of the inputs, with fewer variations in numbers.\n\n2. **Simplification and Grouping**: Looking closer, it seems that the outputs can be grouped into segments of the same number. This suggests that the transformation might involve replacing certain numbers with others based on their position or the values around them.\n\n3. **Rule Derivation**:\n    - **Example 1 Analysis**: The input starts with a mix of 1s, 0s, and 2s, and the output simplifies this to a sequence of 1s followed by 0s and then 2s. This could indicate that the rule involves grouping or replacing numbers based on their sequence or position.\n    - **Example 2 and 3 Analysis**: Similar to Example 1, the outputs simplify the inputs into segments of the same number. Notably, the number 1 seems to dominate the first part of the output, followed by 0s, and then 2s appear at the end.\n\n4. **Identifying the Rule**: After examining the examples, a possible rule could be that the output grid is divided into three segments based on the input:\n    - The first segment consists of 1s, which seems to replace all occurrences of 1 and possibly other numbers in the first part of the input.\n    - The second segment consists of 0s, which could replace numbers in the middle part of the input, possibly including actual 0s and other numbers not replaced by 1s.\n    - The third segment consists of 2s, which replaces the occurrences of 2 and possibly other numbers towards the end of the input.\n\nHowever, the exact mechanism of how these segments are determined (e.g., by count, by position, or by a combination of factors) isn't immediately clear from the initial observation.\n\n5. **Detailed Rule Formulation**: Upon closer inspection, it appears that the rule might involve replacing numbers based on their counts or positions in a way that simplifies the grid into segments of the same number. The outputs suggest a pattern where the grid is divided into segments, but the division points and the numbers used in each segment need to be determined.\n\n6. **Refining the Rule**:\n    - **Counting and Position**: One approach is to consider the count of each number in the input grid and how their positions influence the output. However, without a clear pattern of how numbers are counted or how positions affect the output, this approach requires further refinement.\n    - **Segmentation Based on Input**: Another approach is to consider how the input grid is segmented. If we look at the transitions from one number to another in the output, we might find a clue. The outputs suggest a progressive change from 1 to 0 to 2, which could be related to the sequence or distribution of numbers in the input.\n\n7. **Final Rule Identification**: After detailed analysis, a specific, simple rule emerges:\n    - The output grid seems to be divided into three parts based on the input grid's composition and the sequence of numbers.\n    - The first part of the output consists of 1s, the middle part consists of 0s, and the last part consists of 2s.\n    - The division between these parts seems to be related to the distribution and possibly the count of different numbers in the input grid.\n\nHowever, the exact division points and how they are determined by the input grid's numbers and their positions require a clear, identifiable pattern, which upon reevaluation, seems to relate to the sequence and possibly the count of numbers in the input grid.\n\nGiven the test input grid: 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\n\nApplying the observed pattern of simplification and segmentation:\n- The input starts with a mix of numbers, suggesting an initial segment of 1s.\n- The middle part, which seems to be dominated by 0s in the output of examples, would likely follow.\n- The end segment, which is typically 2s in the outputs provided, would then conclude the output grid.\n\nGiven the nature of the examples, where the output grids are simplified into segments of the same number and considering the distribution of numbers in the test input, the predicted output would reflect a similar simplification.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</answer>",

In all examples, the number 2 is sometimes changed to 8, but not always. The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Looking closely at the transitions from 2 to 8, it seems the change occurs when there are two 2s together. However, this is not a consistent rule across all examples. A more nuanced approach is needed.\n\n3. **Analyzing Example 1**: In the first example, the sequence \"2 2\" is changed to \"8 8\" in the output. This suggests that perhaps the rule involves replacing sequences of 2s with a corresponding sequence of 8s, but only under certain conditions.\n\n4. **Analyzing Example 2**: Here, \"2 2\" is changed to \"8 2\", not \"8 8\". This indicates the rule might not simply be about replacing every pair of 2s with 8s but could depend on the context or the length of the sequence of 2s.\n\n5. **Analyzing Example 3**: The sequence \"2 2 2 2 2\" is partially changed to \"8 8 2 2 2\". This suggests that the rule might involve changing the first two 2s in a sequence of 2s to 8s, regardless of the length of the sequence.\n\n6. **Deriving the Rule**: Based on the analysis, the common rule appears to be: For every sequence of 2s in the input grid, change the first two 2s to 8s, and leave the rest of the 2s unchanged. If a sequence of 2s has less than two 2s, it remains unchanged (as seen in Example 2). The number 0 remains unchanged in all cases.\n\n7. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input \"0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\", let's apply the derived rule.\n   - The first sequence of 2s is \"2 2 2 2 2 2 2\". According to the rule, the first two 2s should be changed to 8s, resulting in \"8 8 2 2 2 2 2\".\n   - The second sequence of 2s is \"2 2 2\". Applying the rule, the first two 2s should be changed to 8s, resulting in \"8 8 2\".\n   - Therefore, the predicted output grid is \"0 0 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 2\".\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0 0 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 2</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis**:\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 3 9 0\n   - Output: 3 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6\n   - Observation: The non-zero numbers (5, 6, 3, 9) in the input grid seem to have shifted positions in the output grid. Specifically, they appear to have moved to the left, wrapping around to the end when necessary.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis**:\n   - Input: 0 0 1 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 3 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: Similar to Example 1, the non-zero numbers (1, 5, 3) have shifted to the right in the output grid, but since there are leading zeros, it appears they have shifted to the right without wrapping around. However, considering the first example, it seems more about shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers rather than a straightforward left or right shift.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis**:\n   - Input: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The non-zero numbers (8, 8) have moved two positions to the right. This example further suggests that the movement is not strictly about wrapping around or simple shifting but is related to the position of non-zero numbers.\n\n**Deriving the Rule**:\nFrom these observations, it seems the rule involves shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers within the grid. However, the direction and amount of shift are not immediately clear from the examples provided. Given the examples, a possible interpretation could be that the sequence of non-zero numbers is rotated or shifted in some manner, but the exact mechanism (e.g., based on the number of zeros, the position of the first non-zero number, etc.) is not straightforward.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, a simpler rule might apply: the sequence of non-zero numbers is shifted to the right by a certain number of positions, which could be determined by the total length of the grid or the position of these numbers within the grid. Given the provided examples, if we consider the grid length and how the numbers move, it seems the non-zero numbers are shifted in a way that they move a certain number of steps to the right, wrapping around if necessary, but the key might lie in how many positions they are shifted.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Examples**:\n- In Example 1, the sequence \"5 6 3 9\" moves to the end, which could be seen as a rotation or shift based on the grid's length.\n- In Example 2, \"1 5 3\" moves to the right by 5 positions (considering the grid's length and wrapping around).\n- In Example 3, \"8 8\" moves two positions to the right.\n\nGiven these observations, if we were to apply a consistent rule, it seems we might have missed a simpler pattern in our initial analysis. Let's reconsider the movement of non-zero numbers in terms of grid positions and potential rotation or shifting patterns that could apply universally across the examples.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\nGiven the input: 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0\n\nIf we identify the sequence of non-zero numbers as \"6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7\" and consider applying a shift or rotation based on the observed patterns, we need a clear rule. However, our analysis did not conclusively identify a single, simple rule that applies to all examples provided without ambiguity. \n\nGiven the examples and aiming for a rule that fits all, let's hypothesize that the sequence of non-zero numbers is rotated or shifted in a manner that could involve the length of the sequence or the grid. Without a clear, consistent rule from the examples, predicting the output with certainty is challenging. \n\nHowever, if we were to follow a pattern where the sequence of non-zero numbers is shifted (and considering our observations might not have led to a clear, single rule applicable in all cases), we might consider how many positions to shift these numbers. \n\nGiven the ambiguity in deriving a single rule that applies to all examples without further clarification, let's proceed with the understanding that the task requires identifying a pattern or rule that might not be fully encapsulated by the provided analysis.\n\n<answer>0 0 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0</answer>",

Then, move the last number of this sequence to the front of the sequence, and the rest of the numbers remain in their positions. If there are multiple sequences, the rule seems to apply to the first one encountered from left to right.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input grid:\n- Input: 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The first sequence of identical non-zero numbers is '3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3'. However, according to the rule, we should consider the sequence starting from the first non-zero number, which is '4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3'. The last number of this sequence is '3', but since '4' is not part of the sequence of '3's, we actually consider '4' as the number to move to the end of the '3' sequence, not as part of the sequence itself. Thus, the correct interpretation of the rule here is to move the '4' to the end of the '3' sequence because it's the first distinct number before the sequence of '3's.\n\nTherefore, moving '4' to the end of the '3' sequence, we get:\n- Output: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the provided examples step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid Structure**: Each example represents a 3x3 grid, where the numbers are given in a row-major order (from left to right, top to bottom). For instance, the first example can be visualized as:\n   ```\n   4 4 4\n   0 0 4\n   0 0 0\n   ```\n   And its output as:\n   ```\n   4 4 4\n   0 4 4\n   4 4 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Identifying Patterns**: Looking at the examples, the rule seems to involve replacing certain elements with the dominant non-zero number in the grid, which appears to be the number in the top-left corner or the most frequent non-zero number in the grid.\n\n3. **Analyzing Example 1**: \n   - Input:\n     ```\n     4 4 4\n     0 0 4\n     0 0 0\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     4 4 4\n     0 4 4\n     4 4 4\n     ```\n   - Observation: The zeros in the middle and bottom rows are replaced by 4s, suggesting a fill or spread operation from the top-left or based on the dominant number.\n\n4. **Analyzing Example 2**:\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     9 9 9\n     0 0 9\n     9 0 0\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     9 9 9\n     0 9 9\n     9 9 9\n     ```\n   - Observation: Similar to Example 1, the zeros are replaced by 9s, indicating a pattern where the dominant number (9 in this case) fills in the zeros in a structured manner.\n\n5. **Analyzing Example 3**:\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     5 5 5\n     5 0 0\n     5 0 0\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     5 5 5\n     5 5 5\n     5 5 0\n     ```\n   - Observation: The pattern here is slightly different, with the middle row being completely filled with 5s, but the bottom row only partially filled, suggesting a rule that might prioritize filling rows or columns based on the input pattern.\n\n6. **Deriving the Rule**: Based on these observations, the rule seems to involve filling in the zeros with the dominant non-zero number (the number that appears most frequently, especially in the top-left part of the grid) in a way that prioritizes rows or columns that already contain this number. However, the exact mechanism of how this filling occurs (whether it's based on rows, columns, or some form of proximity to existing non-zero numbers) isn't entirely clear from the examples provided.\n\n7. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - Test Input:\n     ```\n     2 2 2\n     2 0 0\n     2 0 0\n     ```\n   - Applying the observed pattern, we would expect the zeros to be filled with 2s, given that 2 is the dominant number. The filling seems to prioritize rows that already contain the dominant number, suggesting that the middle and bottom rows would be filled with 2s where there are zeros.\n\nGiven the patterns observed and the need to fill in zeros with the dominant number (2 in this case), the predicted output for the test input would logically be:\n```\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n```\nThis prediction is based on the assumption that the rule involves filling in zeros with the dominant non-zero number in a manner that spreads this number throughout the grid, prioritizing areas that already contain this number.\n\n<answer>2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</answer>",

In Example 1, the input has a sequence of 8s starting from the 5th position to the 17th position. In the output, this sequence starts from the 3rd position and ends at the 16th position, effectively shifting the sequence of 8s two positions to the left and shortening it by one position at each end.\n\n2. **Analyzing Example 2**: In Example 2, the sequence of 9s in the input starts from the 6th position to the 16th position. In the output, this sequence starts from the 4th position and ends at the 14th position, again shifting the sequence two positions to the left and maintaining a similar shortening pattern as observed in Example 1.\n\n3. **Further Analysis with Example 3**: Example 3 shows a sequence of 8s from the 5th to the 8th position in the input, which shifts to the 3rd to the 6th position in the output. This example reinforces the observation that the sequence of non-zero numbers shifts two positions to the left.\n\n4. **Deriving the Rule**: Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that the sequence of non-zero numbers (which could be any number other than 0) in the input grid shifts two positions to the left in the output grid. Additionally, the sequence seems to shorten by one position at each end, but this might be a consequence of how the shifting interacts with the boundaries of the grid.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input `0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`, we can apply the derived rule. The sequence of 9s starts from the 7th position to the 12th position. Shifting this sequence two positions to the left would place it from the 5th to the 10th position. However, considering the shortening observed in previous examples, the actual output might adjust the length of the sequence.\n\nGiven the pattern and the rule derived, the output for the test input should reflect the sequence of 9s shifted two positions to the left. Therefore, the sequence of 9s should start at the 5th position and, considering the pattern of shortening, should end at the 9th position, but since we're shifting and shortening, the actual adjustment in length is consistent with previous examples, which suggests the sequence shortens by one at each end after shifting.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

The sequence of non-zero numbers again shifts to the left by 2 positions.\n\n**Derivation of the Rule**:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, it's clear that the rule involves shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid to the left by 2 positions to obtain the output grid. This shift is applied regardless of the value of the non-zero numbers (7 or 4 in the examples).\n\n**Application to the Test Input**:\nGiven the test input: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers (3) starts at the 3rd position and ends at the 3rd position (since there's only one non-zero number).\n- Applying the rule, we shift this sequence 2 positions to the left. Thus, the 3 should move from the 3rd position to the 1st position.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid is: 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the provided examples step by step.\n\n1. **Identifying Patterns**: The first step is to look for any patterns or changes from the input to the output in each example. In Example 1, the input contains a sequence of 2s with some 0s interspersed. The output shows that the first sequence of 2s remains unchanged, but the sequence of 2s that follows after a zero is replaced with 1s.\n\n2. **Analyzing Example 2**: In Example 2, we see a similar pattern. The input has sequences of 4s with 0s in between. The output keeps the initial sequence of 4s as is but changes the subsequent sequence of 4s (after a zero) to 1s.\n\n3. **Analyzing Example 3**: Example 3 follows the same rule. The input contains sequences of 6s with zeros in between, and the output keeps the first sequence of 6s unchanged while replacing the subsequent sequence of 6s (after a zero) with 1s.\n\n4. **Deriving the Rule**: From the analysis, the rule appears to be that any sequence of numbers (other than zero) that appears after a zero in the input grid is replaced with 1s in the output grid. Sequences of numbers before the first zero and zeros themselves remain unchanged.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input grid:\n   - The sequence starts with zeros, which remain unchanged.\n   - The first sequence of 9s (before any zero) remains unchanged.\n   - After the first zero, there's another sequence of 9s, which, according to the rule, should be replaced with 1s.\n   - The subsequent zeros and the final sequence of 9s (if not following a zero) would follow the same logic.\n\nThus, applying the rule to the test input:\n0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nShould result in:\n0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the provided examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing the Pattern**: Looking at the examples, it seems that the numbers are shifting. In Example 1, the sequence of non-zero numbers (9 2 7 4 7 7 4 3 2 6 3 8) appears to shift to the left in the output, and the zeros at the beginning of the input are moved to the end of the output. A similar pattern is observed in Examples 2 and 3, where the non-zero sequences (8 1 2 2 8 7 and 8 2 8 5 1 3, respectively) also shift to the left, and the leading zeros are moved to the end.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: The rule appears to involve shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left by the number of leading zeros in the input. For instance, in Example 1, there are 4 leading zeros, so the sequence of non-zero numbers shifts 4 positions to the left, and the 4 zeros are appended at the end. In Example 2, there are 9 leading zeros, but the sequence of non-zero numbers (8 1 2 2 8 7) shifts to the left by 1 position because there's one less leading zero than the total number of zeros before the sequence, effectively moving one zero from the end to the beginning, and the rest of the zeros remain at the end. This observation might have been misleading; a clearer observation is that the non-zero sequence simply shifts to the left, replacing the leading zeros, and the trailing zeros are then appended.\n\n3. **Refining the Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it seems the actual rule is simpler: the sequence of non-zero numbers shifts to the left, replacing the leading zeros, and the trailing zeros are then appended to the end. The number of positions the non-zero sequence shifts is equal to the number of leading zeros in the input.\n\n4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: The test input is 0 0 0 0 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0. Following the observed rule:\n   - The leading zeros are 4.\n   - The sequence of non-zero numbers is 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2.\n   - This sequence shifts 4 positions to the left, replacing the leading zeros.\n   - The resulting sequence is 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0 0 0.\n   \nTherefore, applying the rule to the test input, we get the output grid as follows:\n\n<answer>6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0 0 0</answer>",

In all examples, the input grid consists of a sequence of 0s and 6s (or 3s in the test case, but we'll consider the pattern first with 0s and 6s), and the output grid also consists of a sequence of 0s and 6s.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it appears that the rule might involve shifting or moving the sequence of non-zero numbers (6s in the examples, 3s in the test case) to the left or right while keeping the 0s in place or adjusting them accordingly. Let's examine each example more closely:\n   - **Example 1**: The sequence of 6s starts at the 5th position in the input and ends at the 26th position. In the output, this sequence starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 25th position, effectively shifting the sequence of 6s two positions to the left.\n   - **Example 2**: Here, the sequence of 6s starts at the 3rd position and ends at the 24th position in the input. In the output, it starts at the 1st position and ends at the 23rd position, again shifting the sequence of 6s two positions to the left.\n   - **Example 3**: The sequence of 6s starts at the 16th position and ends at the 24th position in the input. In the output, it starts at the 14th position and ends at the 23rd position, shifting the sequence two positions to the left.\n\n3. **Deriving the Rule**: From these observations, it seems the rule is to shift the sequence of non-zero numbers (6s in the examples, 3s in the test case) two positions to the left. This means we need to identify the start and end positions of the non-zero sequence in the input and then shift this entire sequence two positions to the left in the output, adjusting the positions of the 0s accordingly.\n\n4. **Applying the Rule to the Test Case**: In the test input grid, the sequence of 3s starts at the 10th position and ends at the 16th position. Applying the derived rule, we shift this sequence of 3s two positions to the left. Thus, in the output, the sequence of 3s should start at the 8th position and end at the 14th position.\n\nGiven this analysis, the output grid for the test input should reflect the sequence of 3s shifted two positions to the left, with the rest of the positions filled with 0s as per the input's pattern.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

However, since the rule about shifting seems to be misunderstood in the initial analysis (given the actual transformation in examples), let's correct the understanding based on the provided examples:\n  - The actual rule seems to be about removing the first zero after a sequence of non-zero numbers and shifting the next non-zero number to its place, and ensuring the last element is 0.\n\nCorrecting the analysis based on the actual transformation observed:\n- The first non-zero sequence is \"3 8 4\", followed by zeros, then \"7 7 1\", followed by zeros, and then \"5\".\n- The rule, as directly observed from examples without overcomplicating, seems to be: \n  - Keep non-zero numbers where they are.\n  - If a zero is immediately after a non-zero number and is followed by another non-zero number, the zero is replaced by the next non-zero number.\n  - Ensure the last element is 0.\n\nThus, applying the corrected understanding to the test input:\n- Input: 3 8 4 0 0 0 7 7 1 0 5 0 0\n- The sequence \"3 8 4\" is followed by zeros, and the next non-zero is \"7\", which doesn't directly replace the first zero after \"4\" because there are multiple zeros and the rule isn't about shifting all non-zeros to the left but rather replacing the immediate zero after a non-zero sequence with the next non-zero if applicable.\n- The correct application, as per the examples, would thus directly place non-zero numbers as they are and ensure the last element is 0, without shifting all non-zeros to the left as initially misinterpreted.\n\nGiven the direct observations from examples:\n- The output should keep \"3 8 4\" as is, followed by the replacement of the first zero with \"7\" (since \"7\" is the next non-zero), resulting in \"3 8 4 7\", then \"7 1\" remains as is because it's followed by a zero, and \"5\" remains as is. The last element must be 0.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid, following the observed rule directly from examples without overcomplication, is:\n<answer>3 8 4 7 7 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: The first step is to look for any patterns or symmetries in the input and output grids. At first glance, there doesn't seem to be a straightforward arithmetic or geometric transformation. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the non-zero elements in the input grid are mirrored or reflected in some way to produce the output grid.\n\n2. **Identifying the Axis of Symmetry**: Looking at the examples, it seems that the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input is reversed in the output. This suggests that there might be an axis of symmetry or a midpoint around which the sequence is flipped.\n\n3. **Testing the Reversal Hypothesis**: Let's test this hypothesis by applying it to each example. For instance, in Example 1, the non-zero part of the input is \"9 6 2 6 2 5 5 8 6 8 5 7 1 7 8\". If we reverse this sequence, we get \"8 7 1 7 8 5 8 6 8 5 2 6 2 6 9\", which matches the non-zero part of the output.\n\n4. **Considering the Role of Zeroes**: The zeroes in the input grid seem to act as placeholders or buffers, marking the beginning and end of the sequence that needs to be reversed. They do not participate in the reversal process themselves.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", we identify the non-zero sequence as \"3 8\". Reversing this sequence gives us \"8 3\".\n\n6. **Constructing the Output**: Placing the reversed sequence back into the output grid, with the zeroes remaining in their original positions, we get the predicted output.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

The dominant number is the one that appears most frequently in the part of the sequence relevant to '2'.\n- If '2' is at the start or end of a sequence of the same number, it replaces '2' with that number.\n- Zeros not adjacent to '2' or not part of the dominant sequence remain unchanged.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\n- '2' is preceded by zeros, which are not considered dominant in this context since they do not form a significant sequence that would influence the replacement of '2'.\n- '2' is followed by a sequence of '3's, which is the dominant number after '2'.\n- Therefore, according to the rule, '2' should be replaced by '3', the dominant number following it.\n\nThus, applying the rule, the output grid should be:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0</answer>",

In all examples, non-zero elements from the input grid appear to be moved to the left side of the output grid, maintaining their original order of appearance from left to right.\n\n2. **Example 1 Analysis**: In the first example, the non-zero elements in the order of their appearance are 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 6, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4. However, the zeros are not carried over to the output; only the non-zero numbers are preserved in the order they first appear: 4, 8, 9, 8, 4, 6, 9, 4, 4. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros.\n\n3. **Example 2 Analysis**: Similar to Example 1, the non-zero elements in their order of appearance are 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3. Again, ignoring the zeros and preserving the order of non-zero numbers, we get 4, 8, 9, 9, 7, 8, 3. The output grid starts with these numbers followed by zeros.\n\n4. **Example 3 Analysis**: The non-zero elements in order are 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1. Ignoring the zeros and maintaining the order gives 1, 1, 5, 8, 9, 8, 8, 1. The output grid begins with these numbers, followed by zeros.\n\n5. **Derivation of the Rule**: The common rule among these examples is that all non-zero numbers from the input grid are preserved in the order of their first appearance and are placed at the beginning of the output grid. All zeros and any subsequent appearances of non-zero numbers are ignored in the output. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros.\n\n6. **Application to the Test Input**: Given the test input grid \"0 8 7 0 3 4 0 3 1 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 2 7 5 4\", applying the derived rule:\n   - The non-zero elements in their order of first appearance are 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4.\n   - Thus, the output grid starts with these numbers: 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4.\n   - The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>8 7 3 4 3 1 9 9 2 7 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

However, following the pattern where the output mostly mirrors the input with adjustments for the zero or breaking sequence, and considering the output examples provided where the sequence remains intact when there's no distinct \"breaking point,\" the predicted output should be the same as the input, as there's no zero or different number to shift.\n\nTherefore, the output grid, following the derived rule and the patterns observed, should remain unchanged from the input.\n\n<answer>4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4</answer>",

It appears that the expansion stops when it encounters a segment of the grid that is not adjacent to the original sequence of numbers. However, upon closer inspection, it seems the rule might be simpler: the non-zero elements are shifted or rearranged in some systematic way.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis**:\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: Here, the sequence of 8s shifts to the right, filling the preceding zeros and leaving the trailing zeros empty.

This could indicate that the shift is not necessarily to the right but could be influenced by the position of the sequence within the grid or the presence of other numbers.\n\nGiven these observations, a common rule could be that **sequences of non-zero numbers shift to fill the preceding zeros**. However, the exact mechanism of this shift (whether it's to the right, left, or another direction) isn't entirely clear from the examples provided. \n\nFor the test input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the observed rule, if we consider the sequence of non-zero numbers (in this case, just \"2\"), there's only one non-zero element. Following the pattern where non-zero elements seem to shift to fill preceding zeros, but given there's only one \"2\" and no clear direction of shift from the examples, the most straightforward application would be to not shift it at all since there's no sequence to speak of, or to consider it as part of a sequence that doesn't move because it's singular and there are no adjacent non-zero numbers to form a sequence with.\n\nThus, the predicted output, based on the simplest interpretation of the observed patterns and without a clear direction for a single non-zero element to shift, would be to leave the \"2\" in its original position or consider a rule that doesn't apply a shift to single elements without a clear sequence direction.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

In the given examples, we notice that the output grids seem to be related to the presence and distribution of the numbers 0, 1, and 2 in the input grids.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it appears that the output grid is determined by the majority or presence of certain numbers in segments of the input grid. However, the exact rule is not immediately clear from this observation alone.\n\n3. **Breaking Down the Examples**: Let's break down each example to see if we can identify a more specific rule:\n   - **Example 1**: The input starts with several 0s, followed by 2s, then 1s, and so on. The output seems to mirror or complement this pattern but with a twist that isn't immediately obvious.\n   - **Example 2 & 3**: Similar patterns are observed, but the key might lie in how the numbers are grouped or distributed across the grid.\n\n4. **Detailed Analysis**: Upon a more detailed analysis, it seems that the rule might involve replacing sequences of numbers with a dominant number or a specific pattern based on the input. However, the provided examples don't clearly indicate a simple majority rule or a straightforward substitution pattern.\n\n5. **Alternative Approach**: Given the complexity and the fact that a straightforward rule isn't immediately apparent, let's consider an alternative approach. What if the rule involves a transformation based on the position or the count of specific numbers in the sequence?\n\n6. **Reevaluating the Examples**: Reevaluating the examples with this in mind, we notice that:\n   - The outputs seem to have a pattern where 2s and 1s are more evenly distributed or appear in a specific sequence that doesn't directly correlate with their appearance in the input in a simple manner.\n   - There's no clear indication of how the numbers are transformed or rearranged based on their original positions or counts.\n\n7. **Conclusion on Rule**: After careful analysis, it seems challenging to pinpoint an exact rule based on the provided examples without more context or a clearer pattern. The transformation from input to output doesn't follow a straightforward logical or mathematical operation that can be easily deduced from the given information.\n\nGiven the challenge in identifying a clear, consistent rule from the examples provided and the instruction to follow a specific format for the answer, I will proceed with the prediction based on the observation that the rule might involve a specific rearrangement or transformation that isn't directly inferable from the given examples.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: The first step is to look for any patterns or rules that apply to all examples. In Example 1, the input contains a mix of 0s and 6s, and the output also contains a mix of 0s and 6s but in a different arrangement. The same observation can be made for Examples 2 and 3, where the numbers are different (6s and 0s in Example 2, 1s and 0s in Example 3), but the principle of rearrangement seems consistent.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it appears that the rule might involve some form of spatial or positional transformation rather than a simple numerical operation. Let's examine the transition from input to output more closely.\n\n3. **Analyzing Example 1**: In the input of Example 1, notice that whenever there's a block of 6s, in the output, these blocks seem to be mirrored or complemented in some way. Specifically, looking at the blocks of 6s and 0s, it seems that the blocks of 6s in the input become blocks of 0s in the output and vice versa, but with a twist that involves the position and possibly the size of these blocks.\n\n4. **Considering Block Sizes and Positions**: Let's consider the blocks of numbers in the input and how they might be transformed. If we divide the input into blocks of the same number, we can see patterns such as sequences of 6s and sequences of 0s. The transformation seems to involve these blocks but doesn't simply replace one number with another uniformly across the entire grid.\n\n5. **Deriving the Specific Rule**: After careful observation, a potential rule could be that each block of the same number in the input is replaced by a block of the opposite number (6 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 6, for example) in the output, but the size and position of these blocks seem to be preserved in a mirrored or complementary fashion. However, this doesn't fully explain the transformation seen, especially considering the examples provided.\n\n6. **Reevaluating the Rule**: Given the examples, another approach is to consider the transformation at a more granular level, possibly involving operations on individual elements or small groups of elements rather than large blocks. However, without a clear pattern of replacement, addition, or multiplication that applies uniformly, we must consider spatial arrangements and how elements might be rearranged or transformed based on their position or the position of neighboring elements.\n\n7. **Spatial Transformation**: Considering a spatial transformation, where the position of elements in the input grid determines their value in the output grid, doesn't immediately yield a clear, consistent rule across all examples provided. The transformation seems more complex than a simple shift or mirror.\n\n8. **Alternative Approach**: Given the complexity and the fact that a straightforward rule isn't immediately apparent, let's consider if there's an alternative way to interpret the transformation, such as considering the grid as a whole, looking for patterns in the arrangement of numbers, or even considering the numbers themselves as part of a code or representation that needs to be decoded or transformed in a specific way.\n\n9. **Reconsidering the Examples**: Upon re-examining the examples, if we look at the input and output grids as representations of binary data (where 6 or 1 could represent a '1' and 0 represents a '0'), there still isn't a clear, simple transformation (like bitwise operations) that explains the change from input to output across all examples.\n\nGiven the provided examples and the process of elimination and observation, the exact rule that applies to all cases isn't straightforwardly discernible with the given information. The transformation from input to output seems to involve a complex rule that isn't immediately apparent from the examples provided. Without a clear, identifiable pattern or rule that applies uniformly across all examples, predicting the output for a new input grid with certainty is challenging.\n\nHowever, based on the instruction to follow the format to the letter and provide an answer, and without a clear rule derived from the examples, I must proceed under the assumption that a specific rule was expected to be identified, which wasn't successfully done in this analysis.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0</answer>",

Specifically, the sequence of `3`s at the end of the input is mirrored to the beginning of the output, and the sequence of `0`s is shifted accordingly.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis**:\n   - Input:  `5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5`\n   - Output: `5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5`\n   - Observation: Similar to Example 1, the pattern of `5`s from the end of the input is mirrored to the beginning of the output, and the `0`s are adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis**:\n   - Input:  `1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1`\n   - Output: `0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - Observation: This example seems slightly different because the mirroring effect observed in the previous examples is not as straightforward. However, if we consider the sequence of `1`s at the beginning and the single `1` at the end, the output could be seen as a transformation where the beginning and end patterns are altered.\n\nGiven these observations, the common rule does not seem to follow a simple arithmetic or geometric transformation. Instead, it appears to involve a form of pattern mirroring or shifting, particularly concerning the sequences of non-zero numbers at the beginning and end of the input grids.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection and considering the need for a clear, step-by-step reasoning process, let's re-evaluate the examples with a focus on the positioning of non-zero elements and the overall pattern transformation:\n\n- The examples suggest that the non-zero elements from the end of the input sequence are mirrored to the front in the output, while the zeros are adjusted to fill the gaps.

In all examples, the number 2 in the input grid is sometimes replaced by 8 in the output grid, but not always. The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Identifying Conditions for Change**: We need to identify under what conditions a 2 is replaced by an 8. Looking at the examples, it seems that a 2 is replaced by an 8 if it is part of a sequence of 2s that are surrounded by or followed by zeros, or if it's the first or last in a sequence of 2s that directly borders a sequence of zeros.\n\n3. **Analyzing Example 1**: In the first example, the sequence of 2s at the beginning and end of the grid are replaced by 8s because they are directly adjacent to zeros. The middle sequence of 2s is also replaced by 8s because it is surrounded by zeros.\n\n4. **Analyzing Example 2 and 3**: Similar patterns are observed where 2s are replaced by 8s when they are at the edges of a sequence of 2s that borders a sequence of zeros.\n\n5. **Deriving the Rule**: Based on the observations, the rule seems to be that any 2 that is directly adjacent to a 0 (either immediately before or after a sequence of 2s) is replaced by an 8. If a 2 is part of a sequence of 2s that does not border any zeros, it remains a 2.\n\n6. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input grid: 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n\n- The first sequence of 2s (2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2) is bordered by zeros, so all these 2s should be replaced by 8s.\n- The sequence of zeros (0 0 0 0 0 0 0) remains unchanged as zeros.\n- The last sequence of 2s (2 2 2 2 2 2) is also bordered by a zero, so these 2s should be replaced by 8s.\n- The final zero remains unchanged.\n\nThus, applying the derived rule, the output grid should be: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n\n<answer>0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0</answer>",

The key observation missed in the initial analysis is the specific movement pattern of the zeros in relation to the grid's structure and the examples provided.\n\nGiven the examples and the task to predict the output for a new input grid:\nInput: 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the observed pattern, where the distinct sequence (in this case, the sequence of sevens) seems to be the focus, and considering how zeros are moved or positioned in the output:\n\nThe correct approach to derive the rule involves understanding the grid's transformation based on the given examples, which seems to have been misinterpreted in the initial step-by-step analysis. Given the nature of the task and the need to apply the rule correctly, let's re-evaluate the transformation pattern:\n\n- In Example 1, the zeros move to the middle.\n- In Example 2, there's no movement because there are no distinct elements to move.\n- In Example 3, the zeros move to right after the initial sequence of sixes.\n\nFor the given input, if we consider moving the sequence of zeros to a position that reflects a pattern similar to the examples, we notice the initial analysis might have overcomplicated the rule. The rule seems to involve moving the distinct elements (zeros) to a specific position in the grid, but the exact nature of this movement wasn't accurately captured.\n\nGiven the test input and the need to apply the rule correctly, the output should reflect the movement of distinct elements in a manner consistent with the provided examples. However, the initial analysis failed to accurately define this movement in a way that can be applied universally.\n\nGiven this, the task requires a reevaluation of the rule based on the examples provided, focusing on the movement of distinct sequences within the grid. The initial analysis attempted to break down the examples but may have missed the simplicity of the rule or applied an overly complex interpretation.\n\nTo simplify, if we look at the examples again with a focus on the zeros:\n- Example 1 moves the ending zeros to the 25th and 26th positions.\n- Example 3 moves the sequence of zeros to immediately follow the initial sequence of sixes.\n\nGiven the input: 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnd considering a simplified rule that might involve moving the initial or distinct sequences to specific positions within the grid, the output should reflect a similar transformation.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

However, the exact mechanism of this shift isn't immediately clear from the examples provided. Let's consider another approach by looking for patterns in the shifts or transformations:\n\n- In Example 1, the block of 6s shifts 4 positions to the right.\n- In Example 2, the interpretation isn't straightforward due to the extensive presence of 6s, but if we consider the first 6, it moves to the first position, which could be seen as shifting to the left, but given the context, it might be more about the sequence's behavior at the edges.\n- In Example 3, the single 7 shifts 3 positions to the right.\n\nGiven these examples, a simple shift rule doesn't seem to apply universally. However, if we consider the grid size (16 elements) and the fact that non-zero elements seem to move towards the right or spread out in some manner, we might need to reconsider our initial observations for a more consistent rule.\n\nUpon reevaluation, let's consider a rule where non-zero elements move or are placed based on their position or value in a way that isn't directly proportional to their original position but rather to their presence in the grid:\n\n- **Potential Rule**: Non-zero elements move to the right, potentially wrapping around or spreading based on their original distribution. However, the exact nature of this movement isn't clearly defined by the provided examples without a more specific pattern or rule.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies in deriving a clear, universal rule from the examples, and considering the request for a step-by-step reasoning process leading to a final answer, let's apply a more generalized approach based on observed shifts and transformations:\n\nFor the **Test Input**:\n9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n\nIf we apply a hypothetical rule where non-zero elements (9 in this case) shift to the right, considering the grid's edges and the distribution of non-zero elements, we might expect the two 9s at the beginning to shift towards the right, potentially wrapping around or moving based on their value and position.

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: In each example, the input grid consists of a series of zeros and a block of non-zero numbers (3 in Example 1, 2 in Example 2, and 6 in Example 3). The output grid shows a transformation of the input where the block of non-zero numbers seems to shift or expand in some manner.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Looking closely at the examples:\n   - In Example 1, the block of 3s in the input starts at the 5th position and ends at the 26th position. In the output, this block starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 24th position, effectively shifting the block two positions to the left and reducing its length by two (from 22 numbers to 20 numbers, but considering the shift, it's more about the block's left boundary moving left and the right boundary moving left as well but not as much).\n   - In Example 2, the block of 2s starts at the 5th position and ends at the 16th position. In the output, it starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 12th position, again shifting left but maintaining a similar pattern of reduction.\n   - In Example 3, the block of 6s starts at the 12th position and ends at the 16th position. In the output, it starts at the 9th position and ends at the 13th position, showing a leftward shift.\n\n3. **Refining the Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it seems the rule might not be about shifting the block left by a fixed number of positions but rather about the block expanding or shifting in such a way that its left boundary moves closer to the start of the grid, and its right boundary also moves but in a manner that could be related to the length of the block or its original position.\n\n4. **Common Pattern Identification**: A key observation is that in all cases, the block of non-zero numbers seems to move towards the left, and its length or the positions it occupies change. However, there's a clearer pattern when considering the movement of the first non-zero element to the left and how the rest of the block adjusts.\n\n5. **Deriving the Specific Rule**: Given the examples, it seems challenging to pinpoint an exact mathematical rule (like a specific shift or expansion factor) that applies universally across all cases without more information. However, a common theme is the leftward shift of the non-zero block. \n\nGiven the provided examples and the test input, if we were to apply a simplified interpretation of the observed pattern (considering the shift of the first non-zero element and the adjustment of the block), we might predict the output based on shifting the block of 6s to the left. \n\nHowever, without a clear, specific rule derived from the examples that fits all scenarios perfectly (such as a consistent shift or a rule based on the block's length or starting position), predicting the exact output for the test input requires making an educated guess based on observed patterns.\n\nGiven the test input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnd considering the need to follow the format strictly for the answer, let's proceed to the answer section with the understanding that the rule might involve shifting the block of non-zero numbers to the left, similar to the examples provided.\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

Specifically, the block of zeros in the input grid appears to shift or expand to fill the space from the start of the sequence up to the position where the first non-zero element after the zeros starts in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis**:\n   - Input: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8\n   - Output: 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n   - Observation: Here, the single zero in the input grid seems to \"move\" to the middle of the sequence in the output, effectively splitting the sequence of eights into two parts with the zero in the middle.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis**:\n   - Input: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5\n   - Output: 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 5\n   - Observation: The zeros at the end of the input sequence appear to move towards the center of the sequence in the output.\n\nFrom these observations, a common rule starts to emerge:\n- The rule seems to involve the movement or expansion of zeros within the sequence from their original positions in the input grid to new positions in the output grid.\n- Specifically, the zeros appear to move towards the center of the sequence or expand to fill a certain portion of the sequence.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection and considering the need for a rule that applies universally across all examples, it becomes apparent that the initial interpretation might be too simplistic or incorrect. Let's reconsider the examples with a focus on the total count of elements and the distribution of zeros and non-zeros:\n\n- **Reconsideration**:\n  - In each example, the total number of elements is 12.\n  - The zeros in the input seem to be replaced or surrounded by the non-zero elements in a way that could suggest a mirroring or a specific pattern of replacement.\n\nGiven this, let's propose a different rule based on the distribution and mirroring of elements:\n\n- **Proposed Rule**: The output grid is derived by mirroring the input grid around its center. If the input grid has an even number of elements, this would mean splitting the grid into two halves and then mirroring each half. For an odd number of elements, the central element remains unchanged, and the elements on either side mirror each other.\n\nApplying this rule to the provided test input:\n- **Test Input**: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n- To mirror this sequence, we split it into two halves: [6 6 6 6 6 6] and [6 6 0 0 0 0]. Then, we mirror these halves. The first half remains [6 6 6 6 6 6] when mirrored. The second half, when mirrored, becomes [0 0 0 0 6 6].\n\nThus, combining these, the output grid, according to the mirroring rule, would be:\n0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid for the test input, based on the mirroring rule, is:\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Identifying Patterns**: The first step is to look for any patterns or changes from the input to the output in each example. In Example 1, the sequence of 7s moves from the right end of the grid towards the left by 2 positions (from positions 17-21 to positions 14-19, considering the first position as 1). Similarly, in Example 2, the sequence of 8s also moves towards the left, this time from positions 6-19 to positions 3-18. In Example 3, the sequence of 4s moves from positions 9-22 to positions 6-21.\n\n2. **Determining the Shift**: From the observations, it seems that the sequence of non-zero numbers in each input grid shifts towards the left by a certain number of positions to form the output grid. To determine the exact shift, let's look closer at the examples:\n   - In Example 1, the shift is 3 positions to the left (since 7s moved from positions 17-21 to 14-19, a 3-position shift to the left).\n   - In Example 2, the shift is also 3 positions to the left (8s moved from positions 6-19 to 3-18, considering the first position as part of the shift).\n   - In Example 3, again, the shift is 3 positions to the left (4s moved from positions 9-22 to 6-21).\n\n3. **Applying the Rule**: Given the consistent shift of 3 positions to the left for the sequence of non-zero numbers in each example, we can infer that the rule involves shifting the block of non-zero numbers 3 positions to the left from their original position in the input grid.\n\n4. **Test Input Application**: Applying this rule to the test input grid:\n   - The input grid is: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - The sequence of 8s is currently at positions 10-17.\n   - Shifting this sequence 3 positions to the left would place it at positions 7-14.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid, after applying the rule of shifting the non-zero sequence 3 positions to the left, would be:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

In all examples, the input and output grids are 5x5 or represented as a sequence of 25 numbers.\n\n2. **Identifying Changes**: By comparing each input with its corresponding output, we can see that some zeros in the input grid are replaced by non-zero numbers (3 or 9) in the output grid. Specifically, it appears that zeros surrounded by non-zero numbers are changed to the non-zero value.\n\n3. **Analyzing Example 1**: In the first example, the input has a block of zeros in the middle row and column. In the output, these zeros are filled with 9s, but only where they are adjacent to existing 9s. This suggests a rule where a zero becomes a non-zero if it is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a non-zero number.\n\n4. **Confirming with Other Examples**: Looking at Example 2 and Example 3, the same pattern holds. Zeros that are adjacent to 3s (the non-zero number in these examples) are replaced by 3s in the output. This confirms our initial observation that the transformation rule involves replacing zeros with the non-zero value when they are adjacent to that non-zero value.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule**: Given the test input grid, we apply the rule as follows:\n   - Start with the input grid: 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Identify zeros that are adjacent to non-zero numbers (3 in this case). \n   - Replace these zeros with 3.\n\nLet's visualize the grid to apply the rule more easily:\n```\n3 3 3 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0\n```\nCorrected visualization of the input as a 5x5 grid:\n```\n3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0\n```\nApplying the rule:\n- The zeros in the second row, second and third columns, are adjacent to 3s, so they become 3s.\n- The zero in the third row, third column, is adjacent to a 3, so it becomes a 3.\n- Other zeros do not have adjacent non-zero numbers, so they remain zeros.\n\nThe resulting output grid after applying the rule is:\n```\n3 3 3 0 0\n0 3 3 0 0\n0 3 3 3 0\n0 0 3 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0\n```\nFlattening the grid back into a sequence:\n3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0</answer>",

In all examples, the number 2 in certain positions changes to 8 in the output, while other positions remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Looking closely, it seems the change from 2 to 8 happens in the first occurrence of a sequence of 2s in each row or sequence. However, since these are one-dimensional arrays, we should consider the sequence as a whole. The rule seems to apply to the first set of consecutive 2s and possibly others based on their position in the sequence.\n\n3. **Analyzing Example 1**: In the first example, the first set of 2s (which is actually a set of four 2s) gets changed to 8s. This suggests that the rule might involve replacing the first occurrence of a sequence of 2s with 8s.\n\n4. **Further Analysis**: However, looking at Example 2 and 3, it seems the rule is not just about the first sequence of 2s but possibly about sequences of 2s that are \"leading\" or at the beginning of a segment of the array. In Example 2, all leading 2s in a long sequence are changed to 8s until a 0 is encountered, which suggests the rule might be related to the sequence of numbers until a certain condition (like encountering a 0) is met.\n\n5. **Deriving the Rule**: After careful observation, it seems the rule could be: Replace the leading 2s in any sequence of 2s with 8s until you encounter a number that is not 2 (in this case, a 0), and then stop the replacement for that sequence. This rule seems to apply across all examples given.\n\n6. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input grid: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, applying the derived rule would mean replacing the leading 2s with 8s in each sequence of 2s separated by 0s. The first sequence of eight 2s would all be replaced with 8s because they are leading and consecutive. The sequence after the first 0 would also have its leading 2s replaced with 8s until the next 0 is encountered.\n\nGiven this analysis, the predicted output grid, following the format for the answer, is:\n\n<answer>8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",
