      "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls.\nThe total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. total_toys_before = 75 + 43 + 24 = 142.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of bouncy balls by subtracting the total number of toys before from the total number after buying the bouncy balls.\nThe total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls is 206. To find the number of bouncy balls, subtract the total number of toys before buying the bouncy balls from this number. bouncy_balls = 206 - 142 = 64.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{64}$",

She noticed that she was out of plastic plates, so she bought a new package of plates. Later, her husband also bought a package of 14 new plates and gave them to Olivia. While Olivia was making the vegetable lasagna, she used 8 of the plates to sample her vegetable lasagna. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 36 plates.

      "full_model_response": "To find out how many plates were in the package Olivia bought, let's denote the number of plates in Olivia's package as x.\n\nWe know that Olivia's husband bought a package of 14 plates. \n\nOlivia used 8 plates to sample her lasagna.\n\nWhen she went to set the table, she had a total of 36 plates.\n\nSo, the total number of plates can be represented by the equation: x (plates Olivia bought) + 14 (plates her husband bought) - 8 (plates used for sampling) = 36 (total plates at the end).\n\nThe equation becomes: x + 14 - 8 = 36.\n\nSimplifying the equation gives: x + 6 = 36.\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides of the equation gives: x = 30.\n\nTherefore, the number of plates in the package that Olivia bought is 30.\n\n<answer>30</answer>",

Since Michael saw the comet a second time when he was 4 times the age his uncle was when he saw the Comet, and his uncle was 24 years old, Michael was 4 * 24 = 96 years old when he saw the Comet the second time.\n\nGiven that the Comet orbits the sun every 55 years, the difference in age between the two sightings for Michael would be 55 years. \n\nSo, when Michael saw the Comet for the first time, he was 96 - 55 = 41 years old.\n\n<answer>41</answer>",
