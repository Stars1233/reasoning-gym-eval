      "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). This rule is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.\n\nGiven the expression: ((0x1b28 >> 0x2) - (0xe27d * 0xb6bb))\n\n1. First, we perform the shift operation: 0x1b28 >> 0x2. \n   - 0x1b28 in decimal is 6992.\n   - Shifting 6992 right by 2 bits (0x2) is equivalent to dividing by 4 (2^2).\n   - So, 6992 / 4 = 1748.\n   - 1748 in hexadecimal is 0x6e4.\n\n2. Next, we perform the multiplication: 0xe27d * 0xb6bb.\n   - 0xe27d in decimal is 57981.\n   - 0xb6bb in decimal is 46651.\n   - 57981 * 46651 = 2703519031.\n   - 2703519031 in hexadecimal is 0xa13fffb7f.\n\n3. Now, we subtract the result of the multiplication from the result of the shift operation:\n   - We have 0x6e4 - 0xa13fffb7f.\n   - Converting both to decimal for ease of calculation:\n     - 0x6e4 = 1748.\n     - 0xa13fffb7f = 2703519031.\n   - Subtracting: 1748 - 2703519031 = -2703517283.\n   - Converting -2703517283 to hexadecimal:\n     - The negative sign is preserved, and we convert 2703517283 to hexadecimal, then apply the negative sign.\n     - 2703517283 in hexadecimal is 0xa13fffb7f, but since our result is negative, we keep the negative sign.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>-0xa13fffb7f</answer>",

Shift the result right by 0x2 (which is 2 in decimal):\n   - Shifting 0x11796434 right by 2 gives us 0x11796434 / 0x4 (since shifting right by n bits is equivalent to dividing by 2^n, and 2^2 = 4)\n   - 0x11796434 / 0x4 = 0x2ee401a (in decimal, this operation would be 18299044 / 4 = 4577261, but again, we're working in hex)\n\nSo, the result of ((0x24fd * 0x5922) >> 0x2) is 0x2ee401a. \n\n<answer>0x2ee401a</answer>",
