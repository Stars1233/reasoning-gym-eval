If this statement were true, it would mean that all statements, including itself, are false. This creates a paradox because if all statements are false, then Statement 3 cannot be true. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since we've established that Statement 3 is false, Statement 5's truthfulness now depends on the truthfulness of Statement 4.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then it must be one of the true statements, and there are 3 other false statements besides itself. Given that Statement 3 is false, we need to determine the truthfulness of the other statements to see if Statement 4 can hold true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that at least 7 of these 7 statements are true. If this were true, it would mean all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 being false. Thus, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 2 of these 7 statements are false. Given that we already know Statement 3 is false and Statement 1 cannot be true (because it contradicts the existence of any false statements), we have at least 2 false statements. This statement's truthfulness depends on the number of false statements among the remaining ones.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The possible numbers of true statements (out of 7) that are prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. The possible numbers of false statements (out of 7) that are composite are 4 and 6, since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Combine Information\nGiven that Statement 3 is false, and considering the constraints imposed by the other statements, we need to find a combination that satisfies all conditions. Statement 5 indicates that if Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 could be true, which would mean exactly 4 statements are false. This would also satisfy Statement 7, as 4 is a composite number. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime, which would be 3 in this case (since 7 - 4 = 3), and 3 is indeed a prime number.\n\n## Step 9: Determine Possible Solutions\nConsidering the above steps, the only feasible scenario that doesn't lead to a contradiction involves Statement 4 being true (exactly 4 false statements), which in turn makes Statement 5 true (since Statement 3 is false), and given the constraints, we find that Statements 1 and 3 are false. Statement 2's claim that at most 2 statements are false is contradicted by our findings, making it false. Statement 6 is true because we have 3 true statements (2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, but since 2 and 7's truthfulness depend on the count of false and true statements respectively, and given that we've established a scenario where 4 statements are false, this makes Statements 2 and 7's truth values critical to the overall solution). However, given the prime requirement and composite requirement, we've established a feasible set of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Finalize Solution Count\nGiven the analysis, there's exactly one set of conditions under which all statements can be true or false without contradiction, based on the requirements of prime and composite numbers of true and false statements respectively, and the specific claims of each statement.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

      "full_model_response": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 5 of these 7 statements are true. This means the number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 0 of these 7 statements are false. This implies all statements must be true for this statement to hold, meaning 7 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false, which means exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This statement creates a mutual exclusivity between Statements 3 and 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nGiven these conditions:\n\n- **Statement 2** can only be true if all statements are true, which contradicts the conditions of Statements 3, 4, and 5. Thus, Statement 2 must be false.\n\n- Since **Statement 2** is false, **Statement 1**'s condition (at least 5 true) can still be satisfied without conflicting with the falsehood of Statement 2.\n\n- **Statement 5** indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 4 is false (which would mean more or less than 3 true statements, fitting the \"not both\" condition). Conversely, if Statement 4 is true (3 true statements), then Statement 3 is false.\n\n- Considering **Statement 6**, for the number of true statements to be prime, we have the options of 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements. Given Statement 1's constraint (at least 5 true), the only prime number of true statements that satisfies this is 5 or 7.\n\n- **Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be composite (4 or 6). If there are 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements, which does not satisfy Statement 7. If there are 7 true statements, there are 0 false statements, which also does not satisfy Statement 7. However, if we consider the possibility of 3 true statements (as per Statement 4), there would be 4 false statements, satisfying Statement 7.\n\nGiven these constraints:\n\n- **Statement 2** is false.\n- **Statement 5** dictates a choice between Statements 3 and 4. If Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), it conflicts with Statement 7 (since 2 false statements are not composite). Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true under these conditions.\n- **Statement 4** being true (3 true statements) satisfies Statement 7 (4 false statements, which is composite) but conflicts with Statement 1 (at least 5 true statements) and Statement 6 (3 is prime, but it doesn't fit with the \"at least 5 true\" from Statement 1).\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the conditions create a paradox unless we consider the exact wording and implications of each statement carefully. \n\nThe critical insight is recognizing that **Statement 2** being false allows for flexibility in the number of true statements, but **Statement 1** sets a lower bound. **Statement 6** limits the number of true statements to prime numbers, and **Statement 7** limits the number of false statements to composite numbers.\n\nThe only scenario that fits all given conditions without contradiction, considering the mutual exclusivity and the specific requirements for the number of true and false statements, is having exactly 5 true statements. This satisfies **Statement 1** (at least 5 true), **Statement 3** (exactly 5 true), and **Statement 6** (5 is a prime number). It also means **Statement 4** is false (since it claims exactly 4 false statements, implying 3 true statements). With 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements, which does not directly satisfy **Statement 7** (since 2 is not composite), indicating a potential oversight in the initial analysis regarding the composite requirement for false statements.\n\nUpon reevaluation, considering the constraints and the aim for consistency:\n\n- If **Statement 3** is true (exactly 5 true statements), **Statement 5** is also true because it states either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. \n- **Statement 6** is satisfied with 5 true statements (prime number).\n- However, **Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be composite. With 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements, which is not composite, creating a conflict.\n\nThe resolution to this puzzle requires acknowledging that the conditions provided lead to a scenario where not all statements can be true without violating at least one condition, given the constraints. The error in the analysis was in attempting to satisfy all statements without considering the implications of their truthfulness on the overall consistency of the system.\n\nGiven the constraints and the necessity for the statements to be logically consistent:\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This implies that the maximum number of false statements is 3, meaning the minimum number of true statements is 4 (since there are 7 statements in total).\n\n3. **Statement 3** claims exactly 5 statements are true. If this is true, then 2 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4** claims exactly 2 statements are false, which means 5 statements are true. This directly contradicts Statement 3 if we consider the number of true statements but actually aligns in the count of true statements, making it a bit confusing without further analysis.\n\n5. **Statement 5** says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, both Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially describe the same scenario regarding the number of true and false statements (5 true, 2 false), making this statement somewhat misleading because it implies a distinction where there isn't one in terms of outcome.\n\n6. **Statement 6** says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible numbers of true statements, according to this statement, are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7** says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6 (since 1 is neither prime nor composite by definition in this context, and 2, 3, 5, 7 are prime). This implies the possible numbers of false statements are 4 or 6, meaning 3 or 1 true statements, respectively, which does not directly align with the possibilities given by Statement 6 when considering all statements together.\n\nNow, analyzing the possibilities:\n\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), then 2 are false. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 2 true), contradicts Statement 2 (at most 3 false, but we have 2 false which fits), fits Statement 5's condition in a sense but is misleading as explained, satisfies Statement 6 (5 is a prime number), and does not satisfy Statement 7 (2 false statements is a prime number, not composite).\n\n- Considering Statement 6, if the number of true statements is prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and combining with other statements:\n  - For 2 true statements, 5 are false, which does not fit Statement 2 and does not satisfy Statement 7 directly since 5 false is a prime number of false statements.\n  - For 3 true statements, 4 are false, which fits Statement 2, does not directly fit Statement 7 since 4 is composite (but this could be a possible solution considering other constraints).\n  - For 5 true statements, as discussed, it's a potential solution but has its contradictions.\n  - For 7 true statements, 0 are false, which fits Statement 1, contradicts Statement 2, and does not fit Statement 7 since 0 is neither prime nor composite in this context.\n\nGiven the analysis, the only scenario that seems to potentially fit without causing direct contradictions across all statements is having exactly 5 true statements and 2 false statements, which aligns with the conditions of Statements 3 and 4, and partially satisfies other statements without directly violating them, except for the nuances around Statement 5 and the direct contradiction with Statement 7.\n\nHowever, considering the strict definitions and implications:\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 essentially describe the same outcome.\n- Statement 5's condition is technically met because it doesn't account for the fact that Statements 3 and 4 describe the same state.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied with 5 true statements.\n- Statement 7 is not satisfied with 2 false statements.\n\nGiven the complexity and the apparent contradictions, it seems there might be an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the compatibility of all statements. The key lies in identifying which statements can be true together without causing a paradox.\n\nUpon reevaluation:\n- The critical insight is recognizing the potential for Statements 3 and 4 to both be true in terms of the outcome they describe (5 true, 2 false), which then makes Statement 5's claim about them being exclusive potentially misleading but not directly relevant due to the outcome being the same.\n- Statement 6 supports a scenario with 5 true statements.\n- However, Statement 7 requires a composite number of false statements, which is not met with 2 false statements.\n\nThe solution must satisfy all statements without contradiction, considering the nuances of each. Given the constraints and upon careful consideration, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the reconciliation of these statements under the initial analysis, particularly around the satisfaction of Statement 7 and the implications of Statement 5.\n\nGiven the conditions and reevaluating for clarity and precision in determining the number of possible solutions that satisfy all given statements without contradiction:\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Given that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 contradict Statement 1, and considering the implications of Statement 1, Statement 5's condition cannot be satisfied without violating the conditions set by Statement 1.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Given that we have 7 statements, the possible prime numbers of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. Given 7 statements, if 5 are true (as suggested by some statements), then 2 are false, which is a prime number, not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Consistency\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 requires at least 6 true statements.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true according to Statement 5, and both contradict Statement 1.\n- Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime.\n- Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite.\n\n## Step 9: Finding Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements, the only way for Statement 1 to be true and not contradict other statements (given their constraints) is if exactly 6 statements are true. This would make Statement 1 true. However, this scenario must be tested against the other statements for consistency.\n\n## Step 10: Checking for Consistency with Exactly 6 True Statements\nIf exactly 6 statements are true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is automatically true since at most 7 can be false, and only 1 is false in this scenario.\n- Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 5 are true.\n- Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 2 are false.\n- Statement 5 is false because it requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but not both, and both are false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, which creates a contradiction since we assumed 6 true statements to satisfy other conditions.\n- Statement 7 is false because 1 false statement is a prime number, not composite.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluating Based on Contradictions\nGiven the contradictions found, especially with Statement 6 and the initial assumption of 6 true statements, we must consider if there's another configuration that satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\n## Step 12: Considering 7 True Statements\nIf all 7 statements are true:\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 6 are true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 7 can be false, and none are false.\n- Statement 3 is false because it says exactly 5 are true.\n- Statement 4 is false because it says exactly 2 are false.\n- Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because 0 false statements can be considered a composite number in this context, as it does not have a positive divisor other than 1, but this is a stretch in interpretation.\n\nHowever, this scenario also leads to inconsistencies, particularly with Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n\n## Step 13: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the analysis, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the evaluation process, particularly with the interpretation of Statement 6 and the consideration of prime and composite numbers in the context of true and false statements. The correct approach should focus on the logical consistency across all statements rather than individual statement analysis. Let's correct the approach:\n\nFor all statements to be logically consistent:\n- Statement 1 requires at least 6 true statements.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime.\nThe only prime number that satisfies Statement 1 and is less than or equal to 7 (the total number of statements) is 7 itself, implying all statements must be true for Statement 6 to be true and satisfy Statement 1. However, this leads to a contradiction with Statements 3, 4, and 5, as they cannot all be true simultaneously with Statement 1 and Statement 6.\n\nGiven this, the initial analysis overlooked the direct implications of Statement 6 and the prime requirement, leading to an incorrect path. The correct interpretation should focus on the feasibility of satisfying all conditions without contradiction, which seems challenging given the constraints.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

If this statement were true, it would mean that all statements, including itself, are false. This creates a paradox because if all statements are false, then Statement 3 cannot be true. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since we've established that Statement 3 is false, Statement 5's truthfulness now depends on the truthfulness of Statement 4.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the implications of Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true, it means exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false. Given that Statement 3 is already determined to be false, we need to find one more false statement to satisfy Statement 4's condition.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 claims that at least 4 of these statements are true, and Statement 2 claims that at most 3 of these statements are false. These two statements are equivalent in meaning because if at least 4 statements are true, then at most 3 can be false. If Statement 4 is true, and we have already identified one false statement (Statement 3), we need to consider the implications of having exactly 2 false statements on the truthfulness of Statements 1 and 2.\n\n## Step 5: Assess Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number, and Statement 7 states that the number of false statements is a composite number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the possible number of true and false statements\nGiven that Statement 3 is false, and if Statement 4 is true (meaning exactly 2 statements are false), we have to consider the prime and composite conditions. With 7 statements in total, if 2 are false, 5 must be true. 5 is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6. The number of false statements, 2, is not composite (since 2 is prime), which would seem to contradict Statement 7 if we were considering it in isolation without the context of the other statements' truth values.\n\n## Step 7: Re-evaluate the statements for consistency\nGiven the conditions and the fact that Statement 3 is false, we must find a set of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction. Statement 5 indicates that since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 could potentially be true, but we must ensure this aligns with the other statements.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the scenario where Statement 4 is true\nIf Statement 4 is true, and given that exactly 2 statements are false (with Statement 3 being one of them), we need another statement to be false. This scenario must align with Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7.\n\n## Step 9: Align with Statements 1 and 2\nFor Statement 1 to be true (at least 4 statements are true), and considering Statement 2 (at most 3 statements are false), having exactly 2 false statements satisfies both, as it means 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 10: Final assessment of prime and composite conditions\nWith 5 true statements, which is a prime number, Statement 6 is satisfied. However, the number of false statements being 2 (a prime number, not composite) seems to contradict Statement 7. This indicates a misunderstanding in the application of Statement 7's condition in the context of possible solutions.\n\n## Step 11: Correct interpretation of Statement 7\nStatement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. Given that we have 2 false statements, which is a prime number, not composite, this creates a conflict if we consider Statement 4 as true without evaluating the overall consistency with all statements.\n\n## Step 12: Reconsider the truthfulness of Statement 4\nGiven the constraints and the need for consistency across all statements, we must question whether Statement 4 can indeed be true under these conditions, considering the prime and composite requirements.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the possibility of Statement 4 being false\nIf Statement 4 is false, it means that the number of false statements is not exactly 2. Given Statement 3 is false, we need to consider other configurations that satisfy all given conditions, including the prime and composite requirements.\n\n## Step 14: Consider configurations satisfying all conditions\nWe need at least 4 true statements to satisfy Statement 1, and the number of true statements must be prime (Statement 6). With 7 statements, possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Given Statement 1, only 5 and 7 are viable. However, if all statements were true (7 true), Statement 3 would be false, which fits, but we must ensure the number of false statements (0 in this case) aligns with being composite, which it does not, as 0 is neither prime nor composite in this context.\n\n## Step 15: Final configuration check\nConsidering the constraints, if 5 statements are true (satisfying Statement 6 because 5 is prime), and thus 2 are false, we must ensure this configuration can satisfy all statements without contradiction, including the misunderstanding about composite and prime conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Statement 6 limits true statements to prime numbers, and Statement 7 limits false statements to composite numbers.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Possible Scenarios\nGiven Statement 6, the possible numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, Statement 7 indicates the number of false statements must be composite (4 or 6), which means the number of true statements could be 3 (4 false) or 1 (6 false), considering the total is 7 statements. But, Statement 1 requires at least 4 true statements, narrowing our focus.\n\n## Step 10: Reconciling Statements\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but given the constraints, especially from Statements 1, 6, and 7, we must find a scenario that satisfies all conditions. Statement 3 and Statement 4 both imply 4 true statements, which is not a prime number, contradicting Statement 6. Thus, our initial analysis may need adjustment based on the interplay of these constraints.\n\n## Step 11: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nConsidering all constraints, especially the requirement for the number of true statements to be prime and the number of false statements to be composite, and given that exactly 4 true statements satisfy several conditions but conflict with the prime requirement, we must identify a solution that fits all given statements' criteria, including the prime and composite conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means all statements must be true for this statement to hold, as there are only 7 statements in total.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that either all statements are true, or exactly one is false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then it must be the only true statement, making all other statements false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.' This means all statements are false, which directly contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 3.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given Statement 4 cannot be true without making all statements false (including itself, which is a paradox), Statement 5 suggests that if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements that are prime in this context could be 2, 3, 5, or 7, given there are 7 statements.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. This means the number of false statements could be 4 or 6, as 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite (with 0 and 1 not being considered composite or prime in most mathematical contexts, and 2, 3, 5, 7 being prime).\n\nConsidering the constraints:\n- **Statement 3 and Statement 4** cannot both be true, and if either is true, it leads to a contradiction with other statements. Statement 4 being true means all statements are false, which is a paradox. Statement 3 being true means only one statement is true, which would make Statement 1, Statement 2, and potentially others false, depending on their truth values.\n- **Statement 1** requires all statements to be true for it to be true, which conflicts with Statement 3 and Statement 4 directly.\n- **Statement 6** suggests the number of true statements must be a prime number, which could potentially align with Statement 1 if all statements are true (7 true statements), but given the other constraints, finding a scenario where all statements can be true without contradiction is challenging.\n\nGiven these analyses, there are significant constraints and potential contradictions among the statements, particularly with Statements 1, 3, and 4. \n\nFor **Statement 3** to be true, it must be the only true statement, which means Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7 must all be false. However, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 5 could potentially be true if Statement 4 is false, but this creates a conflict because Statement 5 being true would mean either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which could potentially hold but does not satisfy all other conditions without contradiction.\n\n**Statement 4** cannot be true without creating a paradox (all statements being false, including itself).\n\n**Statement 1** being true requires all statements to be true, which directly conflicts with Statements 3 and 4.\n\nGiven these constraints and the requirement for logical consistency:\n- If all statements were true, it would satisfy Statement 1 and potentially Statement 6 (7 is a prime number), but it contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4 directly.\n- If only one statement is true (Statement 3), it creates a scenario where most statements are false, which could align with some statements but contradicts the requirement for all statements to be logically consistent.\n\nConsidering the potential for logical consistency and the elimination of paradoxes, we can deduce that there are very limited scenarios where all statements can coexist without contradiction. In fact, given the constraints and the nature of the statements, it's challenging to find a scenario where more than one statement can be true without violating the conditions of at least one other statement.\n\nGiven this, the most straightforward approach to determine the number of possible solutions is to consider the logical implications of each statement on the others and to identify any scenarios where all statements can be true or where the false statements do not lead to a paradox.\n\nHowever, the analysis provided shows that the statements are crafted in such a way that they create logical contradictions and paradoxes, especially when trying to satisfy all conditions simultaneously. \n\nTherefore, considering the constraints and the aim for logical consistency across all statements, we find that the system of statements as presented does not easily lend itself to a straightforward numerical solution without further simplification or clarification of the logical rules governing their interaction.\n\nGiven the instructions and the format requested for the answer, and acknowledging the complexity and the potential for paradox in the given set of statements, the solution to the problem as posed, focusing on the number of possible solutions given the truthfulness of the statements and their logical implications, would be approached with the understanding that the statements' interactions lead to a constrained set of possible outcomes.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

If this were the case, then all statements, including Statement 3 itself, would be true. However, this would mean Statement 4 is also true, which contradicts Statement 5 that says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 4 and its implications with Statement 5\nGiven that Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 could potentially be true. If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false. This would mean Statement 5 is also true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, and we've established Statement 3 is false.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate Statement 1\nStatement 1 says at least 3 of these 7 statements are true. Given that we've already determined Statement 3 is false and if we consider Statement 4 as potentially true (which would make Statement 5 true as well), we need to assess the minimum number of true statements required for the overall set to be consistent.\n\n## Step 4: Assess Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims at most 3 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, meaning exactly 2 statements are false, then Statement 2 is also true because 2 false statements fall within the \"at most 3\" false statements criterion.\n\n## Step 5: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. If exactly 2 statements are false (as per Statement 4), then 5 statements are true, which is a prime number. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. Since 2 (the number of false statements if Statement 4 is true) is not a composite number (it's a prime), Statement 7 would be false.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the Number of True and False Statements\nGiven the above analysis, if Statement 4 is true, then:\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 1 is true because at least 3 statements are indeed true.\n- Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements are false.\n- Statement 6 is true because the number of true statements (5) is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because the number of false statements (2) is not a composite number.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the conditions and the analysis, we have a consistent scenario where Statement 4 is true, leading to a specific distribution of true and false statements that satisfies all given conditions without contradiction. This means there is at least one possible solution. However, considering all possible combinations and the constraints provided, this scenario is unique because it satisfies all statements without contradiction, given the initial conditions and the dependencies between the statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This implies that either all statements are true (0 are false) or any combination thereof, including all being false, which aligns with the possibility of all statements being true as per Statement 1.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.' This directly contradicts Statement 1, which requires all statements to be true.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 states 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 5 statements are true, which again contradicts Statement 1.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that both Statement 3 and Statement 4 contradict Statement 1, and considering the absolute nature of Statement 1, this creates a paradox if we consider Statement 1 as a potential truth because it cannot coexist with either Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' The only prime numbers relevant here are 2, 3, 5, and 7 since we have 7 statements. Statement 1 suggests all statements could be true (7 true), which aligns with this.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. For 7 statements, if all are true, then 0 are false, which does not fit the definition of composite. However, if we consider the possibility of some being false, we must look at the combinations that allow for a composite number of false statements.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Paradoxes and Contradictions\nGiven the analysis, Statements 1, 3, and 4 cannot all be true simultaneously due to their contradictory nature regarding the number of true statements. Statement 5 introduces a condition where only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, further complicating the paradox. Statement 6 allows for the possibility of all statements being true (7 true), which would make Statement 7 false since 0 false statements do not constitute a composite number. The critical path is determining which statements can coexist without contradiction.\n\n## Step 9: Identifying Potential Solutions\n- If all statements are true (as per Statement 1), then Statement 7 is false because 0 is not a composite number, creating a contradiction.\n- Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true, and given Statement 5, only one can be true, but both contradict Statement 1.\n- The prime number condition (Statement 6) and the composite number condition (Statement 7) further restrict possible combinations.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and the necessity for the statements to not contradict each other, we must find a combination where the true statements do not lead to a logical paradox. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the statements are crafted in such a way that they create a paradoxical situation, making it challenging to satisfy all conditions without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Statement 3 claims exactly 6 statements are true, and Statement 4 claims exactly 2 statements are false, which also means exactly 5 statements are true. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time because they contradict each other in terms of the number of true statements.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate Statement 3\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 of the statements are true. This would mean Statement 4 is false because it claims exactly 5 statements are true (since 2 are false). Given that Statement 3 is true, Statement 5 would also be true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. With 6 true statements, Statement 1 ('At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.') would also be true. Statement 2 ('At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.') would be true as well because only 1 statement would be false. Statement 6 ('The number of true statements is a prime number.') would be false because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 ('The number of false statements is a composite number.') would be true because 1 is not considered a composite number in this context, but since we have only one false statement, this creates a contradiction because 1 is indeed not composite but the statement might seem initially true due to the singular false statement. However, considering the definition of composite numbers, 1 is not composite, making Statement 7 false under the condition that we strictly define composite numbers as having more than two distinct positive divisors. Thus, if Statement 3 is true, we have a contradiction with the expected truth values of Statement 7.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false, meaning exactly 5 statements are true. This scenario makes Statement 3 false. With 5 true statements, Statement 1 ('At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.') is true. Statement 2 ('At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.') would be false because more than 1 statement is false. Statement 5 ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.') would be true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.

If this is true, then 2 statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 says exactly 0 of the statements are false, meaning all 7 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means we have two scenarios to consider: one where exactly 5 statements are true (Statement 3 is true), and one where all 7 statements are true (Statement 4 is true).\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the number of true statements could be one of these numbers.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies the number of false statements could be one of these, meaning the number of true statements could be 3 or 1 (since 7 - 4 = 3 and 7 - 6 = 1).\n\n## Step 8: Combining the Information\nFrom Statement 5, we consider two main scenarios based on Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true. However, Statement 4 (all statements are true) immediately creates a contradiction with the existence of false statements, so it cannot be true. Thus, we focus on the scenario where exactly 5 statements are true (Statement 3 is true).\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Statement 6 and Statement 7 Together\nGiven that the number of true statements must be prime (Statement 6) and considering our analysis, the only prime number that fits the condition of having exactly 5 true statements is indeed 5 itself, which aligns with Statement 3. For Statement 7, if 5 statements are true, then 2 are false, which does not fit the composite number condition directly since 2 is a prime number. However, this discrepancy suggests we need to reassess the compatibility of all statements.\n\n## Step 10: Reassessing Compatibility\nUpon closer inspection, if Statement 3 is true (exactly 5 true statements), this would mean Statement 4 is false (since only one of them can be true according to Statement 5). With 5 true statements, Statement 1 is also true. Statement 2 would be true as well because having 2 false statements fits within its condition. Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number. However, Statement 7 poses a problem since 2 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number, it's prime.\n\n## Step 11: Conclusion on Statement Compatibility\nThe only scenario that seems plausible under the initial analysis is having exactly 5 true statements. However, this creates a conflict with Statement 7. Let's correct the approach by directly evaluating the statements' truthfulness based on their claims and the conditions they impose on the total number of true and false statements.\n\n## Step 12: Final Evaluation\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation, the critical insight comes from recognizing the limitations and possibilities imposed by each statement on the total count of true and false statements. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, and given the other constraints, especially from Statement 6 and Statement 7, we need to find a configuration that satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

If this is true, then 3 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5** says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means we have two scenarios to consider based on the truth of Statement 3 or Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6** says the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Relevant prime numbers here could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since we're dealing with 7 statements.\n\n7. **Statement 7** says the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. Relevant composite numbers here could be 4 or 6 since we're dealing with 7 statements.\n\nGiven these statements, let's evaluate the possibilities:\n\n- If **Statement 3** is true (exactly 5 statements are true), then Statement 4 must be false (because of Statement 5), and we have 2 false statements. This scenario makes Statement 7 false because 2 is not a composite number. However, it aligns with Statement 6 if we consider that 5 (the number of true statements) is indeed a prime number. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are also satisfied in this scenario.\n\n- If **Statement 4** is true (exactly 4 statements are false), then Statement 3 must be false, and we have 3 true statements. This makes Statement 6 false because 3 is not a prime number relevant to our initial assessment (though it is prime, it doesn't fit the initial consideration of prime numbers being 2, 5, or 7 for true statements). However, it makes Statement 7 true because 4 (the number of false statements) is a composite number. Statement 1 and Statement 2 are also satisfied.\n\nConsidering the constraints and the implications of each statement on the others, we need to find a scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\n**Scenario where Statement 3 is true:**\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: False (because of Statement 5)\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: True (5 true statements, and 5 is prime)\n- Statement 7: False (2 false statements, and 2 is not composite)\n\nThis gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements, satisfying the conditions of Statement 3, and by extension, Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, and Statement 6. Statement 7 is the only one that doesn't fit this scenario, but it's because it's based on the number of false statements being composite, which isn't the case here.\n\n**Scenario where Statement 4 is true:**\nThis scenario doesn't align well because if exactly 4 statements are false, it contradicts the prime number requirement for true statements (since 3 is indeed a prime number but doesn't fit the initial expectation of having 2, 5, or 7 true statements as initially considered).\n\nGiven the analysis, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the initial consideration of prime numbers for true statements. The correct approach should strictly follow the definitions and implications of each statement without preconceived notions of what the prime numbers should be.\n\nUpon reevaluation:\n- **Statement 6** being true means the number of true statements must be a prime number. Given 7 statements, possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- **Statement 7** being true means the number of false statements must be a composite number. Given 7 statements, possible composite numbers for false statements are 4 or 6.\n\nThe only scenario that fits all given conditions without contradiction, considering the prime and composite number constraints, is when **exactly 5 statements are true** (making Statement 3 true), which also satisfies Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) and Statement 1 and Statement 2. However, this leaves us with an inconsistency regarding Statement 7, as 2 false statements do not constitute a composite number.\n\nUpon careful consideration, the analysis missed aligning the statements with the strict definitions of prime and composite numbers and the implications of Statement 5 correctly. The correct interpretation should focus on the logical consistency across all statements.\n\nGiven the strict format requirement and the need to adhere to the logical analysis provided:\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyzing Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that at least 2 of the 7 statements are true. This means if we consider the minimum number of true statements, it has to be 2 or more.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that at most 0 of the 7 statements are false, which implies all statements must be true for this to hold. However, this creates an immediate contradiction with Statements 3 and 4, which cannot both be true alongside Statement 2.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 says exactly 1 of the 7 statements is true. If this were the case, then only Statement 3 itself could be true, making all other statements false, including Statement 1, which requires at least 2 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 7 of the 7 statements are false, which means all statements are false. This directly contradicts the premise of Statement 1 and the possibility of any statement being true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the analysis of Statements 3 and 4, if either were true, it would lead to a contradiction with the conditions set by other statements, particularly Statement 1.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 suggests the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible prime numbers of true statements out of 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 states the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. Given 7 statements, if 2, 3, or 5 statements are false, these would indeed be composite numbers of false statements (since 4, 2, and 0 false statements would correspond to 3, 5, and 7 true statements, respectively, and 4 is composite, but 2 and 0 are not considered composite in this context).\n\n## Step 8: Combining the Analyses\n- Statement 2 cannot be true because it contradicts the possibility of any statement being false.\n- Statement 4 cannot be true because it contradicts the premise that at least one statement (itself) must be true.\n- Statement 3 cannot be true in isolation because it contradicts Statement 1.\n- Statement 5 creates a paradox because if Statement 3 or 4 were true, it would invalidate other necessary conditions.\n- Statement 6 and Statement 7 provide conditions that could potentially be met but are dependent on the truthfulness of other statements.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and contradictions, the only way for these statements to hold true without violating logical principles is to find a combination where enough statements are true to satisfy the \"at least\" conditions without contradicting the \"exactly\" or \"at most\" conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nConsidering all statements and their implications, the critical insight is recognizing which statements can coexist without logical contradiction. Specifically, Statements 1, 6, and 7 can potentially be true without directly contradicting each other, given the right number of true statements. However, given the constraints, especially from Statements 3, 4, and 5, and the requirement for logical consistency, the puzzle's structure suggests a specific solution set that satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

With 6 true statements, this condition is not met because 6 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 says the number of false statements (1 in this case) is a composite number, which is false because 1 is not considered a composite number.\n\nGiven these analyses, we see contradictions and inconsistencies that make it challenging to satisfy all conditions simultaneously. However, the key lies in the prime and composite number conditions and the constraints they impose:\n\n- For **Statement 6** to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- For **Statement 7** to be true, the number of false statements must be a composite number (4, 6, since 0, 1 are not considered composite, and 2, 3 are prime).\n\nGiven these constraints and the statements' requirements, let's reassess the feasibility of each scenario:\n\n1. **Exactly 3 true statements** (as per Statement 3) would mean 4 false statements, which satisfies Statement 7 (since 4 is composite) but contradicts the prime requirement for true statements (since 3 is prime but doesn't fit the overall truthfulness required by other statements).\n2. **Exactly 6 true statements** (contradicting Statement 3 but fitting Statement 4) would mean 1 false statement, which doesn't satisfy Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite).\n\nThe only feasible scenario under the given constraints that could potentially satisfy all statements without contradiction is having **exactly 5 true statements**, which:\n- Satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n- Means Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false.\n- Could potentially satisfy Statement 5 if interpreted in a way that allows for neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 to be exclusively true (though this is a stretch given the direct contradiction).\n- Does not satisfy Statement 6 because 5 is a prime number, but this condition (the number of true statements being prime) is indeed met.\n- Means 2 false statements, which does not satisfy Statement 7 since 2 is a prime number, not a composite one.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the conditions provided by the statements, especially regarding prime and composite numbers, introduce constraints that make finding a solution that satisfies all statements challenging. The analysis above highlights potential contradictions and the difficulty in satisfying all conditions simultaneously, especially considering the prime and composite requirements.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of possible solutions given the truthfulness of these statements.

This means that the minimum number of true statements is 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 says 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies that the maximum number of false statements is 3, which means the minimum number of true statements is 4 (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then 3 statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means that 4 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This creates a direct conflict between Statements 3 and 4, meaning only one of them can be true.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible prime numbers of true statements out of 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers are numbers with more than two factors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6 (since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite).\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- From Statement 1, at least 6 statements must be true.\n- From Statement 2, at least 4 statements must be true.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (Statement 5), and they suggest 4 true statements.\n- Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime.\n- Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite.\n\n## Step 9: Finding Compatible Statements\nThe only scenario that fits all conditions is when exactly 6 statements are true (since 6 is not a prime, this initially seems to contradict Statement 6, but we must consider the implications of all statements). However, given Statement 6 requires a prime number of true statements and considering the constraints, we realize there's a misunderstanding in the direct application of Statement 6 with the others. The actual compatible scenario must adhere to the prime requirement and other constraints.\n\n## Step 10: Reconciling the Prime Requirement\nGiven the strict conditions, especially with Statement 1 requiring at least 6 true statements and Statement 6 requiring the number of true statements to be prime, the only prime number that satisfies the \"at least\" condition is 7 (since 6 is not prime). This means all statements must be true for the prime condition to be met under the constraints given, which seems to create a paradox with Statements 3, 4, and 5. However, upon closer inspection, if all statements are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true as per Statement 5, indicating a logical inconsistency in assuming all statements can be true under these specific conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Resolving the Paradox\nThe conditions provided, especially with the requirement for a prime number of true statements and the constraints around true and false statements, lead to a logical puzzle. Given Statement 1's requirement for at least 6 true statements and the prime requirement, the scenario that fits is having 7 true statements, but this contradicts the specific claims of Statements 3, 4, and the conditional Statement 5. Thus, we must identify a solution that respects all given conditions without assuming all statements can be simultaneously true.\n\n## Step 12: Final Analysis\nConsidering the constraints and the logical inconsistencies that arise from assuming certain combinations of truth values, the key is in the statements' specific wording and the mathematical definitions of prime and composite numbers. The puzzle's solution hinges on finding a configuration that does not violate any statement's condition while also being mathematically plausible.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means the number of true statements can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 says that at most 7 of the 7 statements are false, which implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. However, since there are only 7 statements, this statement is always true because it's impossible for more than 7 statements to be false.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 asserts that exactly 2 of the 7 statements are true. If this is true, then 5 statements are false.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 2 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that 5 statements are true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means we have two mutually exclusive scenarios: one where exactly 2 statements are true (and thus 5 are false), and one where exactly 2 statements are false (and thus 5 are true).\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 says that the number of true statements is a prime number.

This means the number of false statements can be 4 or 6 for this statement to be true.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate Possible Scenarios Based on Statements 3, 4, and 5\nGiven Statement 5, we consider two scenarios:\n- If Statement 3 is true (exactly 2 statements are true), then Statement 4 must be false. In this case, Statement 7 is not satisfied because 5 false statements is not a composite number.\n- If Statement 4 is true (exactly 2 statements are false), then Statement 3 must be false. Here, Statement 7 is satisfied because 5 true statements mean 2 false statements, which is a prime number, not composite, indicating a potential issue with this step's logic regarding composite numbers. However, the focus should be on the truth values satisfying all conditions.\n\n## Step 9: Re-evaluate Statement 7's Impact\nStatement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite (4 or 6). If exactly 2 statements are true (Statement 3), we have 5 false statements, which does not satisfy Statement 7 since 5 is prime, not composite. If exactly 2 statements are false (Statement 4), we have 5 true statements, which means 2 false statements, not satisfying Statement 7's condition directly but indicating a misunderstanding in the application of \"composite\" in this context. The actual consideration should be on how many scenarios satisfy all given conditions, including prime and composite requirements.\n\n## Step 10: Consider Prime and Composite Requirements Together\nFor the number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6) and considering the constraints:\n- If 2 statements are true, it satisfies primality but does not fit with the \"at least 3 true\" requirement from Statement 1.\n- If 3 statements are true, it satisfies both primality and the \"at least 3 true\" requirement.\n- If 5 statements are true, it satisfies both conditions as well.\n- If 7 statements are true, it satisfies the \"at least 3 true\" but also needs to fit with other statements' requirements.\n\n## Step 11: Synthesize Information\nGiven the constraints, especially from Statements 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we need to find a scenario that satisfies all conditions. Statement 2 is always true and thus does not limit our scenarios. The critical analysis revolves around the primality of true statements, the composite nature of false statements, and the mutual exclusivity stated in Statement 5.\n\n## Step 12: Final Analysis\nConsidering all statements, the feasible approach is to identify which statements can coexist as true without violating the conditions set by the others.

Composite numbers among these are 4, 6.\n\nFrom **Statement 2**, we know that at most 1 statement can be false, which means at least 6 statements must be true. This immediately contradicts **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** because they both suggest exactly 4 statements are true, allowing for more than 1 false statement.\n\nGiven **Statement 6**, the number of true statements must be a prime number. Since **Statement 2** dictates that we must have at least 6 true statements to have at most 1 false statement, the only prime number of true statements that fits this criterion is 7 (since 2, 3, and 5 are less than 6).\n\n**Statement 7** says the number of false statements must be composite. If all statements are true (7 true), then there are 0 false statements, which does not fit the definition of composite (since 0 is not considered composite or prime in this context). However, if we consider the possibility of 1 false statement (making 6 true statements), this would not satisfy **Statement 2** (at most 1 false statement) in a way that creates a contradiction with other statements, but it does fit with **Statement 6** (prime number of true statements) if we consider 6 true statements (but 6 is not prime, so this does not actually fit).\n\nConsidering the constraints:\n- **Statement 2** implies at least 6 true statements.\n- **Statement 6** requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n- The only way to satisfy both **Statement 2** and **Statement 6** is to have all 7 statements true, which makes **Statement 7**'s condition (number of false statements is composite) not applicable since there would be 0 false statements.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, if all statements are true, it creates a logical inconsistency with **Statement 5** because **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** cannot both be true if they imply the same condition (exactly 4 true statements), yet for all statements to be true, **Statement 5**'s condition (either **Statement 3** or **Statement 4** is true, but not both) is violated because both would be considered true under the premise of all statements being true.\n\nThe resolution to this puzzle requires acknowledging that some statements cannot all be true simultaneously due to their logical constraints. Specifically, **Statement 2** forces a condition that contradicts the feasibility of **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** being true, given the context of the other statements.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon further reflection, the puzzle's solution hinges on recognizing the logical inconsistencies and impossibilities presented by the statements. The critical insight is recognizing that **Statement 2** and the prime requirement of **Statement 6** push towards a scenario where all statements could potentially be true, but this creates issues with the logical consistency of **Statement 5** and the definitions of composite and prime numbers in relation to the number of true and false statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>0</answer>",

This means the number of true statements can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 1 of these statements is false. This implies the number of true statements can be 6 or 7, since having 0 false statements means all are true, and having 1 false statement means 6 are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 4 of these statements are true. This directly specifies the number of true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 3 of these statements are false. This means exactly 4 statements are true, as there are 7 statements in total.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 imply that exactly 4 statements are true, Statement 5 essentially says that if either 3 or 4 is true, the other must be false, but they both lead to the same conclusion about the number of true statements.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers relevant here (given the constraints of the other statements) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are those that have more than two factors, meaning they are not prime. Relevant composite numbers for the number of false statements (given 7 total statements) could be 4 (since 7-4=3 true statements and 4 is composite), 6 (since 7-6=1 true statement and 6 is composite), or other composites that do not fit within the 7-statement limit.\n\nNow, analyzing the restrictions:\n\n- Statements 3 and 4 both imply exactly 4 true statements, which aligns with Statement 1's minimum but contradicts Statement 2 unless exactly 6 or 7 statements are true, which is not possible if 3 or 4 are true as they specify exactly 4 true statements.\n- Statement 5 ensures that only one of Statements 3 or 4 can be true, but since they convey the same information about the number of true statements, this doesn't add new possibilities.\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers, which could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements given the context.\n- Statement 7 implies the number of false statements must be composite, which would be 4 or 6 false statements given our context (since 7 statements - composite number of false statements = prime number of true statements).\n\nConsidering all these restrictions together:\n\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), this satisfies Statement 1 but not Statement 2 (since Statement 2 requires at most 1 false statement, implying 6 or 7 true statements).\n- A prime number of true statements (Statement 6) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, given the constraints:\n  - 2 true statements would mean 5 false, which is prime, not composite, contradicting Statement 7.\n  - 3 true statements would mean 4 false, which is composite, fitting Statement 7, but we need to check other statements.\n  - 5 true statements would mean 2 false, which is prime, not composite, contradicting Statement 7.\n  - 7 true statements would mean 0 false, which does not fit the composite requirement but does satisfy Statement 2.\n  \nGiven these constraints, the only scenario that fits all possible true statements without contradiction, considering the need for a prime number of true statements and a composite number of false statements, is having exactly 3 true statements and 4 false statements. This satisfies Statements 1, 4, 6, and 7. However, it contradicts Statement 2, which requires at most 1 false statement for 6 or 7 true statements.\n\nThus, considering all given statements and their implications, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the initial analysis regarding the compatibility of these statements under the strict interpretation of their logical implications. The correct approach should reconsider the implications of each statement on the others, focusing on the logical consistency across all statements rather than isolated interpretations.\n\nGiven the logical framework and constraints, let's correct the approach:\n\n1. **Logical Consistency**: Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true because Statement 5 says only one can be true. However, they imply the same outcome (4 true statements), which directly conflicts with Statement 2 (at most 1 false statement) unless we're considering a scenario where these statements can coexist under specific conditions.\n\n2. **Prime True Statements (Statement 6)**: This limits the possibilities to 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Composite False Statements (Statement 7)**: This means the number of false statements should be composite, which could be 4 or 6 given our context.\n\nUpon reevaluation, considering the constraints and the need for logical consistency across all statements:\n\n- **3 True and 4 False**: This satisfies the composite false requirement but does not align with Statement 2.\n- **5 True and 2 False**: Does not satisfy the composite false requirement since 2 is prime.\n- **7 True and 0 False**: Satisfies Statement 2 but does not fit the composite false requirement since 0 is not considered composite in this context.\n\nThe critical insight missed initially is recognizing that these statements, when considered together, impose strict conditions that may not be simultaneously satisfiable without careful consideration of their logical implications. The initial analysis aimed to dissect each statement's contribution to possible solutions but may have overlooked the holistic view of how these statements interact.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need to adhere strictly to the format without further elaboration on the reasoning process within the answer:\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Given that Statement 4 leads to a paradox and cannot be true, and Statement 3 contradicts the first two statements, this statement's truthfulness hinges on the validity of Statement 3 or 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number.

However, given the constraints from Statement 1 and 2, this seems initially inconsistent.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- **Statement 4** cannot be true because it leads to a paradox.\n- **Statement 3** contradicts **Statement 1** and **Statement 2**. If Statement 3 were true, then Statement 1 and 2 must be false, which would make exactly 2 statements true (including Statement 3 itself), but this scenario does not satisfy the conditions set by Statement 1 and 2, which are about the minimum and maximum number of true/false statements.\n- **Statement 5** suggests that either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but given the impossibility of Statement 4 and the contradiction posed by Statement 3 with other statements, Statement 5's truthfulness is dependent on the impossible or contradictory scenarios.\n- **Statement 6** allows for 5 or 7 true statements under the constraints of Statements 1 and 2.\n- **Statement 7** suggests the number of false statements is composite (4 or 6), which would imply 3 or 1 true statements, respectively. However, this seems to conflict with the requirements of Statements 1 and 2.\n\nThe key here is to find a scenario where the statements do not contradict each other and fulfill all given conditions:\n\n1. If **exactly 5 statements are true**, this would satisfy **Statement 6** (since 5 is a prime number) and could potentially satisfy the other statements depending on which ones are true. For **Statement 7** to be true, we need a composite number of false statements, which would be 2 false statements if 5 are true, but 2 is not composite, it's prime.\n\n2. Considering **Statement 1** and **Statement 2**, having exactly 5 true statements seems plausible because it fits within the \"at least 4 true\" and \"at most 3 false\" criteria.\n\nHowever, the critical analysis shows that the statements are crafted in a way that leads to contradictions and paradoxes when trying to satisfy all conditions simultaneously. The statements about prime and composite numbers (6 and 7) and the constraints (1 and 2) limit the possible scenarios significantly.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon further reflection, the puzzle's nature suggests that there might not be a straightforward numerical solution that fits all statements without contradiction, especially considering the logical inconsistencies and paradoxes presented by Statements 3, 4, and 5. \n\nThus, the task of determining the \"number of possible solutions\" under these constraints becomes an exercise in logical reasoning about the statements' compatibility rather than a simple arithmetic problem.\n\n<answer>0</answer>",

Given that Statements 3 and 4 essentially state the same condition (4 true statements and 3 false statements), Statement 5 must be true because it correctly identifies that only one scenario can occur, and they indeed describe the same outcome.\n\n6. **Statement 6** says the number of true statements is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The only prime numbers relevant here (given we have 7 statements) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7** says the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is any positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. Relevant composite numbers here could be 2, 4, or 6, given we have 7 statements.\n\nGiven these statements, let's consider the possibilities based on Statements 3 and 4, which suggest 4 true statements and 3 false statements:\n\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (and thus 3 are false), Statement 3 and Statement 4 are essentially saying the same thing. Statement 5 confirms that only one of these can be true, but in reality, they describe the same scenario.\n- The number of true statements being 4 does not satisfy Statement 6 because 4 is not a prime number.\n- However, 3 false statements do not directly satisfy Statement 7 because 3 is not a composite number; it's a prime number.\n\nConsidering Statement 6 (the number of true statements is a prime number) and knowing that Statement 1 must be true, the possible numbers of true statements that are prime and could satisfy all conditions are 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, if we have 2 true statements, then 5 are false, which doesn't satisfy the \"at most 3 false\" condition of Statement 2. If we have 7 true statements, then 0 are false, which also doesn't fit because it contradicts the premise that we're evaluating the truthfulness of statements that imply variability in truth values.\n\nGiven Statement 5's confirmation that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true (but they essentially state the same thing), and knowing Statement 1 is true, we have to find a scenario that satisfies all conditions. The only scenario that fits without causing paradoxes or contradictions, considering all statements, is having exactly 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which aligns with the content of Statements 3 and 4, even though Statement 5 suggests they cannot both be true. This creates a challenge because, in a logical analysis, both Statements 3 and 4 cannot be simultaneously true if we adhere strictly to Statement 5's \"but not both\" condition. However, their truth conditions are identical.\n\nGiven this complex interplay, let's focus on what we know must be true and what the statements imply about the number of true and false statements:\n\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true because it correctly identifies that only one of the scenarios described by Statements 3 and 4 can occur, even though they describe the same outcome.\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. Given the constraints, this suggests 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements. However, only specific configurations will satisfy all given statements without contradiction.\n\nThe critical insight is recognizing that Statements 3 and 4 describe the same condition (4 true, 3 false), which Statement 5 acknowledges can only happen once. This condition (4 true, 3 false) aligns with the possibility of satisfying the prime number condition for true statements (Statement 6) if we consider the statements' implications broadly.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, the statements create a puzzle where direct satisfaction of all conditions without any contradiction becomes challenging due to the interplay between Statements 3, 4, 5, and 6. Specifically, the requirement for the number of true statements to be prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7) adds layers of complexity.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to avoid paradoxes, let's consider the feasible outcomes based on prime numbers of true statements and the composite number of false statements, keeping in mind that Statement 1 must be true and that Statement 5 essentially validates the singular truth of the condition described by Statements 3 and 4:\n\n1. **2 True, 5 False**: Doesn't satisfy Statement 2 (at most 3 false).\n2. **3 True, 4 False**: Satisfies Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) but doesn't align with Statements 3, 4, or 5 directly.\n3. **5 True, 2 False**: Satisfies Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) but doesn't fit with Statements 3 and 4.\n4. **7 True, 0 False**: Doesn't fit because it implies all statements are true, which contradicts the variability implied by the statements themselves.\n\nConsidering these points, the solution must align with the logical constraints provided, avoiding direct contradictions and satisfying the conditions of prime and composite numbers as stated. However, the direct analysis reveals complexities and potential contradictions, especially considering the prime and composite conditions alongside the specific claims of Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n\nGiven the above analysis and the need to strictly follow the format for the answer, the focus should be on the number of possible solutions that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction, considering the truth of Statement 1, the prime and composite number conditions, and the interplay between Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

So, the number of false statements could be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements could be 3 or 1.\n\nGiven these statements, let's consider the constraints:\n\n- From **Statement 3** and **Statement 4**, if either is true, then exactly 4 statements are true. This satisfies **Statement 1** but we need to check against other statements.\n- **Statement 5** indicates that only one of **Statement 3** or **Statement 4** can be true, but they essentially convey the same condition (4 true, 3 false), which also satisfies **Statement 2**.\n- **Statement 6** suggests the number of true statements must be a prime number. Given that 4 is not a prime number, this creates a conflict with **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** if we consider the prime requirement.\n- **Statement 7** suggests the number of false statements is composite (4 or 6), which means the number of true statements could be 3 or 1, conflicting with the direct implications of **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** but aligning with the possibility of satisfying **Statement 6** if we consider 3 true statements (a prime number).\n\nLet's evaluate possible scenarios based on these constraints:\n\n1. **4 True Statements (as per Statement 3 and Statement 4)**: This satisfies **Statement 1** and **Statement 2** but conflicts with **Statement 6** because 4 is not a prime number. It also doesn't directly conflict with **Statement 7** since 3 false statements is not composite, but this scenario doesn't satisfy the condition of **Statement 7** either because 3 is not composite.\n\n2. **3 True Statements**: This satisfies **Statement 6** (3 is prime) and **Statement 7** (4 false statements, which is composite). It also satisfies **Statement 1** (at least 4 true is not met, but this is a different scenario) and **Statement 2** (at most 5 false is met).\n\n3. **Other Scenarios**: Considering other possible numbers of true statements based on the constraints:\n   - **5 True Statements**: Satisfies **Statement 1** and **Statement 2**, and 5 is prime, satisfying **Statement 6**. However, 2 false statements are not composite, conflicting with **Statement 7**.\n   - **2 or 7 True Statements**: These satisfy **Statement 6** but checking against other statements, especially **Statement 7**, 2 true statements mean 5 false statements (not composite), and 7 true statements mean 0 false statements (not composite), creating conflicts.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most consistent scenario that satisfies the majority of the constraints without direct conflict, especially considering the prime and composite requirements, is having **3 true statements**. However, the question asks for the number of possible solutions, not the solutions themselves.\n\nUpon closer examination, the constraints provided by the statements, especially considering the requirements for prime and composite numbers, limit the possible scenarios significantly. The key is in the interpretation of how these statements interact with each other, particularly with **Statement 5** indicating a mutual exclusivity that doesn't actually change the outcome due to their similar claims, and **Statement 6** and **Statement 7** providing specific numerical constraints.\n\nGiven the analysis, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the direct application of these constraints to derive multiple solutions. The constraints essentially funnel down to very specific conditions, particularly with the prime and composite requirements, which, upon reevaluation, suggest a unique solution set based on satisfying all given conditions without contradiction.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyzing Statement 3 and Statement 4\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 1 statement is true, which means Statement 4 must be false because it claims all statements are false. Conversely, if Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which directly contradicts the truth of Statement 4 itself, making it impossible for Statement 4 to be true.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluating Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given that Statement 4 cannot be true (as deduced in Step 1), if Statement 5 is true, then Statement 3 must be the true one. However, if Statement 3 is true, then only one statement can be true, which means Statement 5 cannot be true because it would imply at least two true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 5), creating a contradiction.\n\n## Step 3: Assessing Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 claims at least 4 of the statements are true, and Statement 2 claims at most 2 of the statements are false. If Statement 1 is true, then 4 or more statements must be true. Statement 2 being true means 5 or more statements must be true (since 7 - 2 = 5). Given the constraints from other statements, especially the impossibility of Statement 4 being true and the potential truth of Statement 3, we must consider the feasibility of these claims under the constraints of the other statements.\n\n## Step 4: Considering Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements out of 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. The composite numbers out of 7 are 4 and 6, meaning 3 or 1 true statements would satisfy this, given that 7 - 4 = 3 and 7 - 6 = 1.\n\n## Step 5: Combining the Information\nFrom the steps above, Statement 4 is impossible, and if Statement 3 is true, it creates a contradiction with Statement 5. Statement 1 and Statement 2 provide a range but are dependent on the overall truth distribution. Statement 6 and Statement 7 give us potential numbers of true and false statements. Given that exactly 1 statement being true (Statement 3) would satisfy the condition of Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and considering Statement 7 (composite number of false statements), we must find a configuration that satisfies all possible true statements.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluating Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints, especially with Statement 3 potentially being true and satisfying the prime condition, and knowing Statement 4 cannot be true, we evaluate the potential for other statements to be true. Statement 5 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true due to the contradiction it creates. Statement 1 and Statement 2's truthfulness depends on the distribution of true and false statements. If Statement 3 is true, then only one statement can be true, which directly contradicts Statement 1 and potentially Statement 2, depending on how many false statements there are.\n\n## Step 7: Finalizing Possible Solutions\nConsidering all constraints, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, and Statement 4 must be false. This leaves Statement 6 and Statement 7. For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime, which is satisfied if only Statement 3 is true (1 true statement). For Statement 7, the number of false statements must be composite, which is also satisfied if 6 statements are false (since 6 is composite). Thus, the only configuration that could potentially work under these constraints is having exactly one statement true, which is Statement 3, satisfying the prime condition of Statement 6 and the composite condition of Statement 7 indirectly by having 6 false statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means that the minimum number of true statements is 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 5 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that the maximum number of false statements is 5, which means the minimum number of true statements is 2 (since 7 - 5 = 2).\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true. If this is true, then it directly contradicts Statement 1, which requires at least 6 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false. This means that 5 statements are true, which supports Statement 1's requirement of at least 6 true statements but does not fulfill it.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the contradiction between Statement 3 and Statement 1, and considering Statement 4 allows for 5 true statements, we must assess the validity of these statements together.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible prime numbers of true statements out of 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are numbers with more than two divisors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6 (since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite).\n\n## Step 8: Combining Information\nConsidering all statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2 provide a range for the number of true statements (at least 6 and at most 2 false, implying at least 5 true). Statement 3 cannot be true because it contradicts Statement 1. Statement 4 suggests 5 true statements, which does not fulfill Statement 1's requirement but is a possibility. Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but given Statement 3's contradiction with Statement 1, Statement 4 is the viable option under this constraint. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime, and Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 requires at least 6 true statements.\n- Statement 4 suggests exactly 5 true statements, which contradicts Statement 1 but is a prime number of true statements as per Statement 6.\n- The only prime number of true statements that satisfies Statement 1 is 7 (since 7 is a prime number and fulfills \"at least 6\" true statements).\n- For 7 true statements, all statements including Statement 7 are true, which means 0 false statements. However, 0 is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nConsidering the constraints and the necessity for the statements to logically align, we find that having exactly 7 true statements contradicts Statement 7 because 0 false statements are not composite. Thus, we must consider scenarios where the number of true statements is prime and does not contradict other statements. The only viable scenario under these constraints is having 5 true statements (which does not fulfill Statement 1 but aligns with some statements), but this leads to contradictions with the requirements for the number of false statements being composite and the prime number of true statements. Given the strict conditions and the contradictions that arise from attempting to satisfy all statements simultaneously, the solution must adhere to the logical constraints provided, focusing on the prime number of true statements and the composite number of false statements without directly contradicting the \"at least\" and \"at most\" conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

Given Statement 5, these are mutually exclusive.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false. This scenario satisfies Statement 1 (at least 3 true) and Statement 2 (at most 3 false). However, it does not satisfy Statement 6 (number of true statements is a prime number) since 5 is prime but we need to check the consistency with other statements.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), then Statement 3 must be false. This scenario satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2. It also satisfies Statement 6 because 6 is not a prime number, which creates a contradiction since Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n\n## Step 11: Check for Consistency Across All Statements\nGiven the constraints, the only way for all statements to be consistent is for Statement 3 to be true (5 true statements), which makes Statement 4 false. With 5 true statements, Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is a prime number. Statement 7 is also satisfied because 2 false statements is not a composite number scenario described, but it's the only way for the statements to hold true without contradicting each other.\n\n## Step 12: Determine the Number of Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and the analysis, there's only one scenario where all statements can be consistent: when exactly 5 statements are true, which includes Statement 3 being true and Statement 4 being false.

This means exactly 5 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.

If 7 statements are true, then 0 are false, which also doesn't fit the definition of composite since 0 is not considered composite or prime in this context.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- **Statement 3** cannot be true because it contradicts the conditions set by Statements 1 and 2.\n- **Statement 4** being true implies 6 statements are true, which fits the conditions of Statements 1, 2, and 5.\n- **Statement 6** suggests the number of true statements must be prime, which could be 5, 6, or 7, but given the constraints, only 6 fits if we consider Statement 4's implication.\n- **Statement 7** suggests the number of false statements must be composite. However, with 6 true statements, we have 1 false statement, which does not satisfy the composite condition directly as 1 is not composite.\n\nConsidering all statements, the only scenario that seems plausible under the constraints given, especially by Statements 1, 2, and 4, is having 6 true statements. This makes Statement 4 true, which in turn, because of Statement 5, means Statement 3 must be false. Statement 6 is satisfied if we consider 6 or 7 true statements as prime, but given the other constraints, 6 is the most fitting. Statement 7 poses a challenge because with 6 true statements, we only have 1 false statement, which doesn't align with the typical definition of composite numbers.\n\nHowever, given the strict definitions and the constraints:\n\n- If exactly 6 statements are true (to satisfy Statements 1, 2, 4, and 6), then Statement 7's condition about the number of false statements being composite is not directly satisfied because 1 (the number of false statements in this scenario) is not considered composite.\n\nGiven this complex interplay, let's focus on the critical statements that set the boundaries:\n\n- Statements 1 and 2 set the stage for at least 5 and at most 6 true statements (since 7 true statements would mean 0 false statements, which doesn't fit well with the \"at most 1 false\" if we interpret \"at most 1\" strictly).\n- Statement 4 suggests 6 true statements, which fits within these bounds.\n- Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or 4 is true, and given the constraints, it must be Statement 4.\n\nThe direct analysis leads to a conclusion where 6 statements being true seems like a potential solution (satisfying Statements 1, 2, 4, and potentially 6), but the composite condition for false statements poses a logical challenge since 1 false statement does not fit the typical definition of composite.\n\nThus, considering the logical constraints and the need for consistency across all statements, the solution space seems constrained to a very specific set of conditions, primarily centered around the truthfulness of Statement 4 and the prime nature of true statements as per Statement 6. However, the exact number of solutions that satisfy all given conditions, especially with the composite requirement for false statements, requires a careful consideration of logical consistency and the definitions of prime and composite numbers.\n\nGiven the constraints and focusing strictly on logical consistency without overcomplicating the prime and composite definitions beyond their basic mathematical meanings:\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

This means we have 2 or more true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' This implies we have 0, 1, or 2 false statements, meaning 5, 6, or 7 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' If this is true, then only one statement is false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' This means 4 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' This statement makes Statement 3 and Statement 4 mutually exclusive.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can start eliminating possibilities based on the constraints:\n\n- **From Statement 3 and Statement 4 being mutually exclusive (Statement 5)**, we can consider each scenario separately:\n    - If Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are true, and only 1 is false. This makes Statement 4 false.\n    - If Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are true, and 3 are false. This makes Statement 3 false.\n\n- **Considering Statement 6**, for the number of true statements to be prime:\n    - If Statement 3 is true (6 true statements), this does not fit because 6 is not a prime number.\n    - If Statement 4 is true (4 true statements), this also does not fit because 4 is not a prime number.\n\n- **Considering Statement 7**, for the number of false statements to be composite:\n    - Statement 3 (1 false statement) does not fit because 1 is not composite.\n    - Statement 4 (3 false statements) does not fit because 3 is not composite.\n\nGiven the constraints and analyzing the statements, we can see that:\n\n- **Statement 3 cannot be true** because it contradicts Statement 6 (6 is not a prime number) and Statement 7 (1 is not composite).\n- **Statement 4 cannot be true** because it contradicts Statement 6 (4 is not a prime number) and Statement 7 (3 is not composite).\n\nHowever, we need at least 2 true statements (Statement 1), and the number of true statements must be prime (Statement 6). The only prime numbers that could represent the number of true statements, given the constraints, are 2, 3, 5, and 7. But Statements 3 and 4, which suggest specific numbers of true and false statements, are constrained by Statement 5 and the definitions of prime and composite numbers.\n\nGiven Statement 1 and the fact that we cannot have 6 true statements (because then Statement 6 would be false, and 1 false statement is not composite), and we cannot have 4 true statements (because then Statement 6 would be false, and 3 false statements are not composite), we look for scenarios where the number of true statements is prime and the number of false statements is composite.\n\nThe possible numbers of true statements that are prime and could fit the given constraints (considering Statement 6 and that we have to have at least 2 true statements) are 2, 3, 5, and 7. However, if we have 2 true statements, we have 5 false statements, which is not composite in the traditional sense used here (though 5 is prime, the context suggests looking for a non-prime, non-1 number of false statements for \"composite\" in a strict interpretation related to the problem's constraints).\n\nConsidering all statements and their implications, the scenarios that could potentially fit all given constraints need to be examined for consistency across all statements. \n\nGiven the complexity and the constraints, let's consider the feasible outcomes based on prime and composite definitions and the mutual exclusivity stated:\n\n- For 2 true statements (and thus 5 false, which is prime, not composite), this does not fit Statement 7.\n- For 3 true statements (and thus 4 false, which is composite), this could potentially fit if it satisfies all other conditions.\n- For 5 true statements (and thus 2 false, which is prime, not composite), this does not fit Statement 7.\n- For 7 true statements (and thus 0 false), this does not fit Statement 7 because 0 is not considered composite in this context.\n\nGiven these considerations and the need for the number of false statements to be composite and the number of true statements to be prime, and considering the constraints provided by all statements, we find that the only plausible scenario under the constraints given (especially considering the definitions of prime and composite and the specific exclusions) would involve a delicate balance that respects all given statements.\n\nHowever, upon careful examination, it appears that finding a scenario that fits all constraints simultaneously is highly constrained and potentially impossible due to the conflicting requirements (e.g., Statement 3 and Statement 4 being mutually exclusive, the prime and composite requirements, etc.).\n\nGiven the constraints and analyzing each statement's implications on the others, it seems there might be an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the feasibility of certain combinations under the strict definitions provided. The critical insight lies in recognizing the implications of each statement on the potential truth values of the others, considering the prime and composite nature of the counts, and the specific exclusivities and inclusions stated.\n\nUpon a detailed review, considering the constraints about prime and composite numbers, mutual exclusivity, and the requirements for true and false statements, it appears that the problem's constraints might be so tight that they could potentially lead to a logical contradiction or a very limited set of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions simultaneously.\n\nGiven this complex interplay and the need to adhere strictly to the format requested for the answer, the solution to the number of possible solutions, considering all constraints and the implications of each statement on the potential validity of the others, would be evaluated based on the logical consistency and feasibility of satisfying all given conditions simultaneously.\n\n<answer>0</answer>",

This means the possible number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 states that at most 4 of the 7 statements are false. This implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, which means the number of true statements can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 says exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true. If this is true, then all other statements must be false, which would make Statement 1 and Statement 2 false because they require more than 1 true statement.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false. This means exactly 2 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 3 directly.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the direct contradiction between Statement 3 and Statement 4, this statement can only be true if one of them is indeed true and the other is false.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible number of true statements, according to this statement, can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that the number of false statements can be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements can be 3 or 1.\n\n## Step 8: Combine the Information\n- From Statement 1, the number of true statements can be 5, 6, or 7.\n- From Statement 2, the number of true statements can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- Statement 3 cannot be true because it contradicts the conditions set by Statements 1 and 2.\n- Statement 4 suggests 2 true statements, which contradicts Statements 1 and 2.\n- Statement 5's truthfulness depends on the validity of Statements 3 or 4, but given the contradictions, it's clear that Statement 3 cannot be true, making Statement 4's potential truthfulness irrelevant due to its contradiction with other statements.\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7 limits the number of true statements to 1 or 3, based on composite numbers for false statements.\n\n## Step 9: Identify Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 3 cannot be true because it contradicts the majority of statements.\n- If Statement 4 were true (exactly 5 false), it would contradict Statements 1 and 2 directly.\n- The only prime number of true statements that fits within the constraints of Statements 1 and 2 is 5 (from Statement 6), as 2 and 3 are too low according to Statement 1, and 7 is not possible if any statement is false.\n- For Statement 7 to be true (composite number of false statements), and considering Statement 6 (prime number of true statements), the only overlap is having 3 true statements (which makes 4 false, a composite number), but this contradicts Statement 1.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nThe only scenario that fits all given statements without contradiction is having exactly 5 true statements, which would make Statements 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 true in a specific context. However, given the constraints and upon closer inspection, it's clear that not all these statements can be simultaneously true without violating the conditions set forth by the others, particularly because Statement 4 (exactly 5 false) cannot coexist with the requirements of Statements 1 and 2 as initially thought. The error in reasoning up to this point has been in trying to reconcile statements that fundamentally cannot all be true at the same time due to their contradictory nature.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This implies that at least 5 of the statements must be true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3\nStatement 3 says 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.' If this statement is true, then only 2 statements can be true, which contradicts Statement 1 and the implication of Statement 2 that requires at least 5 true statements.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4\nStatement 4 says 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.' This means exactly 3 statements are true. This also contradicts Statement 1, which requires all statements to be true for it to be true.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given the contradictions found with Statements 3 and 4 in relation to Statements 1 and 2, this statement's truthfulness depends on the validity of Statements 3 and 4, which we've found to be problematic.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 says 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible numbers of true statements that are prime from 1 to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 says 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers are numbers with more than two factors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6, since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Consistency\n- If all statements are true (as per Statement 1), then Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they state different numbers of true statements, but they also cannot both be false because Statement 5 says one of them must be true.\n- Given the constraints, the only way for Statement 5 to be true without contradicting other statements is if one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but this leads to contradictions with Statements 1 and 2.\n\n## Step 9: Finding Possible Solutions\nGiven the above analysis, we need to find a scenario where all statements can logically coexist without contradiction. Statement 1 requires all statements to be true, which immediately creates a problem with Statements 3 and 4. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements must be prime, and Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements must be composite.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nConsidering all constraints, the only possible scenario where statements do not directly contradict each other (except for the inherent contradictions in Statements 3 and 4 with the rest) is when exactly 5 statements are true. This would make Statement 6 true (since 5 is prime) and would make Statement 7 true (since 2 false statements is not composite, this scenario doesn't fit). However, upon closer inspection, this step's initial reasoning contains an error regarding the composite number of false statements and the prime number of true statements as per Statements 6 and 7. Let's correct this:\n\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be a composite number (4, 6).\n\nGiven these conditions and reconsidering the implications of all statements, the error in logic was assuming a solution could satisfy all conditions without carefully evaluating the prime and composite requirements against the total number of statements and their possible truth values.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means Statements 3 and 4 are true, which automatically satisfies Statement 5. Statement 6 is also satisfied because 5 is a prime number. However, Statement 7 is not satisfied under this scenario because 2 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number.

This means we have two scenarios to consider based on the truth of Statement 3 or Statement 4.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 states that the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers relevant to the possible counts of true statements (3 to 7) are 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers relevant to the possible counts of false statements (0 to 4, considering 7 statements in total) are 4 (since 0, 1, 2, and 3 are not composite or are irrelevant due to the conditions set by other statements).\n\n## Step 8: Evaluating Compatibility and Constraints\nGiven the constraints:\n- From Statement 1 and Statement 2, the overlap suggests 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements are possible.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (Statement 5), creating a fork in possibilities.\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers (3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 implies the number of false statements must be composite, which would be 4 false statements (making 3 true statements) given our constraints.\n\n## Step 9: Finding Consistent Solutions\nGiven these constraints:\n- If Statement 3 is true (4 true statements), it contradicts Statement 6 (since 4 is not a prime number).\n- If Statement 4 is true (4 true statements), it also contradicts Statement 6 for the same reason.\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be 3, 5, or 7. However, Statement 7 requires a composite number of false statements, which aligns with 3 true statements (4 false, a composite number).\n- Statement 5 ensures that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, but given the prime requirement, neither can be true if we are to satisfy Statement 6.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nConsidering all constraints, the only scenario that fits all given statements without contradiction is having exactly 3 true statements and 4 false statements. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 3 true), does not directly conflict with Statement 2 (since at most 3 false implies at least 4 true, which is not our case but does not directly apply due to the specific conditions), aligns with the requirement for a composite number of false statements (Statement 7), and fits the prime number of true statements (Statement 6). However, this means Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, and given our scenario, neither is true as stated, which seems to create a paradox but actually highlights the complexity of satisfying all conditions simultaneously.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

However, given the complexity and the specific constraints of each statement, especially with Statements 3, 4, and 5 creating exclusivity and contradictions, the actual number of solutions that satisfy all given conditions simultaneously needs to consider the logical consistency across all statements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This implies the number of true statements could be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3** claims exactly 6 of the statements are true. If this is true, then Statement 1 and Statement 2 could also be true because they allow for the possibility of 6 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4** claims exactly 0 of the statements are false, meaning all statements are true. However, if all statements are true, then Statement 3 cannot be true because it says exactly 6 are true, not 7.\n\n5. **Statement 5** says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means we have two scenarios to consider based on the truth of Statement 3 or Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6** says the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers relevant here are 5, 6, and 7, as these are the possible numbers of true statements based on previous conditions.\n\n7. **Statement 7** says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are those with more than two factors, excluding 1 and themselves. This means the number of false statements could be 4 (since 4 is composite and allows for 3 true statements, which doesn't fit our previous conditions) or another composite number, but given our constraints, we're mainly looking at the possibility of 1 false statement (which doesn't fit because 1 is not composite) or 2 false statements (2 is not composite but is the only other option under our constraints).\n\nGiven these statements:\n\n- If **Statement 3** is true (exactly 6 statements are true), then Statement 4 must be false (because Statement 5 says only one of them can be true), and Statement 1 and Statement 2 can be true. Statement 6 can be true if we consider 6 as a possible prime number in a more relaxed interpretation, but technically, 6 is not prime. Statement 7 would be true because 1 (the number of false statements in this scenario) is not composite, but this does not fit our initial analysis well since we are looking for composite numbers of false statements. However, our main constraint from Statement 5 and the others suggests we are looking at a scenario where exactly 6 statements are true as a primary possibility.\n\n- If **Statement 4** is true (exactly 0 statements are false), then all statements must be true, which immediately creates a contradiction with Statement 3 and the conditions set by Statement 5.\n\nConsidering the constraints and looking for consistency:\n\n- ** Scenario with Statement 3 being true (6 true statements):** Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6 could potentially be true. However, Statement 6 poses a problem because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 also poses a problem because 1 is not a composite number. Thus, this scenario does not perfectly fit all conditions when considering the strict definitions of prime and composite numbers.\n\n- **Scenario with Statement 4 being true (7 true statements):** This immediately contradicts Statement 3 and the condition set by Statement 5 that only one of them can be true. Also, Statement 6 would be true because 7 is a prime number, and Statement 7 would not apply directly as there are 0 false statements.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need for internal consistency among the statements, we find that there's a challenge in satisfying all conditions simultaneously without contradiction, especially considering the strict definitions of prime and composite numbers and the conditions set forth by the statements themselves.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of possible solutions given the truthfulness of these statements, and upon careful analysis, we see that:\n\n- The scenario where exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3) faces challenges with Statements 6 and 7 under strict definitions.\n- The scenario where all 7 statements are true (Statement 4) contradicts Statement 3 and the exclusivity condition of Statement 5.\n\nThus, upon resolving these considerations and acknowledging the constraints provided by each statement, we recognize the puzzle's nature and the difficulty in satisfying all conditions without any contradiction. The solution hinges on the interpretation of prime and composite numbers and the logical consistency across all statements.\n\nGiven the logical inconsistencies and the specific conditions of the problem, the analysis may lead to recognizing that not all statements can be simultaneously true without violating the principles of logic or the definitions of prime and composite numbers. \n\n<answer>1</answer>",

However, given the direct contradictions and paradoxes created by Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5, we must find a scenario that satisfies all conditions without violating the principles of logic.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate for Logical Consistency\nStatement 1 cannot coexist with Statements 3 or 4. Statement 4 creates a paradox if considered true. Statement 5 tries to reconcile Statements 3 and 4 but fails due to their inherent contradictions with other statements. Statement 6 offers a condition (prime number of true statements) that could potentially be satisfied if we ignore the paradoxical statements. Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) could also be satisfied under certain conditions.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the conditions given by Statements 1 through 5 are so contradictory that they cannot all be true. Statement 1 demands all statements be true, which immediately contradicts Statements 3 and 4. Statement 4, if true, would mean all statements are false, a paradox. Statement 3 suggests a specific number of true statements that contradicts Statement 1.\n\nThe final evaluation must consider which statements can logically coexist. Given the prime and composite conditions, and acknowledging the contradictions, the only logically consistent approach is to identify which statements can be true without causing a paradox.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints and analyzing the logical consistency of the statements, we find that:\n- Statements 1 and 4 cannot both be true.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 1 cannot both be true.\n- Statement 5 tries to reconcile but fails due to the nature of Statements 3 and 4.\n- Statements 6 and 7 provide conditions that could potentially be met but are constrained by the other statements.\n\nThe key is recognizing the paradoxes and contradictions.

Relevant composite numbers in this context could be 4 or 6, since we're dealing with up to 7 statements.\n\nGiven these statements, let's evaluate the possibilities:\n\n- If **Statement 3** is true (exactly 6 true statements), then **Statement 1**, **Statement 2**, **Statement 5** (because it allows for Statement 3 to be true), and **Statement 7** (since 1 false statement is not composite, this actually creates a problem) could potentially be true. However, **Statement 6** would not be true because 6 is not a prime number. This scenario does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 7 cannot be true if there's only 1 false statement.\n\n- If **Statement 4** is true (exactly 5 false statements, meaning 2 true statements), then **Statement 6** could be true because 2 is a prime number, but this contradicts **Statement 1** and **Statement 2**, which require at least 6 true statements or at most 1 false statement, respectively.\n\nGiven the constraints, the only scenario that could potentially satisfy all conditions is if exactly 6 statements are true, which would make **Statement 3** true. However, upon closer inspection, this creates a conflict with **Statement 7** because having exactly 6 true statements means only 1 statement is false, and 1 is not a composite number.\n\nLet's reconsider the prime and composite conditions with the understanding that these statements must be evaluated for their truthfulness based on their own claims:\n\n- For **Statement 6** to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7). \n- For **Statement 7** to be true, the number of false statements must be a composite number (4, 6).\n\nGiven the initial analysis might have led to a misunderstanding of how these statements interact, let's correct the approach:\n\nThe statements that can be true together without immediate contradiction are **Statement 1**, **Statement 2**, and potentially **Statement 3** if we consider the conditions they set. However, **Statement 5** introduces a choice between **Statement 3** and **Statement 4**, and given the analysis, **Statement 4** cannot be true because it contradicts the conditions set by **Statement 1** and **Statement 2**.\n\nThe critical insight comes from recognizing the limitations imposed by **Statement 6** and **Statement 7**. If exactly 6 statements are true (**Statement 3**), then **Statement 6** is not satisfied because 6 is not a prime number. However, if we consider the possibility of all statements being true except for the ones that directly contradict the prime and composite conditions, we find a challenge in satisfying all conditions simultaneously due to the nature of **Statement 4** and **Statement 7**.\n\nUpon reevaluation, the key is recognizing that **Statement 3** being true (exactly 6 true statements) does indeed satisfy **Statement 1** and **Statement 2**, but it creates tension with **Statement 7** because one false statement does not meet the composite number criterion. **Statement 6**, however, could be satisfied if the number of true statements is indeed a prime number, but given the setup, this seems to lead to a contradiction when trying to satisfy all statements.\n\nThe resolution to this puzzle requires acknowledging that some statements cannot all be true at the same time due to their mutually exclusive conditions. The question asks for the number of possible solutions, which involves determining the combinations of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon careful consideration, it appears the analysis may have oversimplified the interactions between the statements. The correct approach involves systematically evaluating the truthfulness of each statement against the others, considering the prime and composite number conditions, and the at least, at most, and exact conditions provided.\n\nHowever, the initial analysis missed a crucial step of systematically checking each statement against the conditions provided by the other statements, particularly how **Statement 5** affects the validity of **Statement 3** and **Statement 4**, and how **Statement 6** and **Statement 7** restrict the possible numbers of true and false statements.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for a systematic approach to evaluate each statement's truthfulness based on the others, let's simplify the conclusion based on the constraints provided:\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Thus, Statement 2 cannot be true.\n\nGiven that Statement 2 is false, we can consider the implications:\n\n- **Statement 3 and Statement 4** both suggest that exactly 4 statements are true. Given Statement 5, only one of these can be true, but since they convey the same information regarding the number of true statements, we consider the scenario where exactly 4 statements are true.\n- **Statement 6** suggests the number of true statements must be a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. However, given the constraints from other statements, especially considering that at least 4 statements must be true (Statement 1), the only prime number that fits is 5, but this contradicts Statements 3 and 4.\n- **Statement 7** suggests the number of false statements is composite. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4, 6. If exactly 4 statements are true, then 3 statements are false, which does not fit the composite requirement directly. However, if we consider the possibility of 5 true statements (to satisfy Statement 6 and the prime requirement), then 2 statements are false, which is a prime number, not composite, creating a contradiction.\n\nGiven these constraints and focusing on the requirement that at least 4 statements must be true and considering the prime and composite conditions:\n\n- **For 4 true statements** (as per Statements 3 and 4), 3 would be false. This fits Statement 7 (since 3 is not composite, it creates a contradiction) and does not directly satisfy Statement 6 (since 4 is not prime).\n- **For 5 true statements**, 2 would be false. This satisfies Statement 6 (5 is prime) but does not fit Statement 7 (2 is prime, not composite).\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, we realize that our analysis missed directly addressing the question of how many solutions are possible given these constraints and misinterpreted the direct implications of some statements.\n\nCorrecting the approach:\n\n- Statements 3 and 4 essentially convey the same information.\n- Statement 5 indicates that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, but since they say the same thing, this doesn't directly affect the count of true statements.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite.\n\nGiven these, let's directly assess viable scenarios:\n\n1. **Exactly 4 true statements** (as per Statements 3 and 4): This makes 3 statements false, which doesn't fit the composite requirement for false statements since 3 is prime.\n2. **Exactly 5 true statements**: This makes 2 statements false, which doesn't fit because 2 is prime, not composite.\n\nHowever, we must consider the constraints more accurately:\n\n- **At least 4 true statements** (Statement 1) combined with the prime requirement (Statement 6) suggests we could have 5 true statements as a viable prime number scenario. But this contradicts the composite requirement for false statements since 2 (7-5) is prime.\n- The only prime number of true statements that could fit all conditions (including composite false statements) would be a scenario where the number of true statements allows for a composite number of false statements. Given the constraints, **exactly 5 true statements** could potentially fit if we ignore the contradiction with Statement 7 for a moment, but it's clear that our initial interpretation missed directly solving for the number of solutions based on these constraints.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation:\n\n- If **exactly 4 statements are true** (to satisfy Statements 3 and 4), this contradicts Statement 6 (since 4 is not prime) but fits Statement 1.

This would mean Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (as we've established), Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false (because only one can be true), Statement 5 is true because it correctly states the condition, Statement 6 could be true if 4 is considered not prime in this context (since prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves, and 4 does not meet this criterion), and Statement 7 would be false because 3 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number (it's prime).\n  \n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, meaning 4 are true. This scenario is identical in outcome to the scenario where Statement 3 is true because both statements assert that 4 statements are true.

However, our analysis shows a contradiction in the number of true and false statements based on the prime and composite conditions, indicating a misunderstanding in the initial interpretation regarding the prime and composite conditions and the implications of Statement 5.\n\nCorrecting the approach based on the strict definitions and implications:\n\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be a composite number (4, 6, since 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 are not composite).\n\nGiven Statement 1 (at least 3 true), Statement 3 (exactly 4 true), and Statement 4 (exactly 3 false, implying 4 true), and considering Statement 5 (only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true), we need to align these with the conditions of Statement 6 and Statement 7.\n\nThe critical insight is recognizing that if exactly 4 statements are true (fulfilling Statement 3 or Statement 4), this would indeed make Statement 6 false because 4 is not a prime number.
