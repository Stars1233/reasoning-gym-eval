Since Matilda is a colleague of Mary and also of John, and she is the exception that allows overlap between the two groups, we need to figure out if Matilda is the female colleague in Mary's circle or if she is an additional person.\n\nJohn has 5 male colleagues and 3 female colleagues. Since Matilda is part of John's circle and is a female, she counts as one of the female colleagues in John's group.\n\nGiven that Matilda is part of both circles and there's no mention of her being anything other than a female, we should consider her as part of the female count in both groups if applicable.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the number of female colleagues Matilda has, not the total count of females in either group. \n\nIn Mary's circle, there is 1 female colleague mentioned. If Matilda is not this female colleague, then Matilda would have 1 female colleague (the one in Mary's circle). However, if Matilda is the female colleague in Mary's circle, then she wouldn't have any female colleagues in Mary's circle because she herself is the female colleague.\n\nIn John's circle, there are 3 female colleagues, and Matilda is one of them. So, excluding herself, Matilda has 2 female colleagues in John's circle.\n\nSince Matilda is part of both circles and we're asked about her female colleagues, we consider both contexts. But the question seems to aim at understanding the overlap and unique connections. \n\nGiven Matilda is the bridge between the two groups and considering the information provided, the direct female colleagues Matilda has are those in John's circle, excluding herself, plus any in Mary's circle if she's not the one mentioned.\n\nThus, considering the information and focusing on Matilda's perspective: In John's circle, she has 2 other female colleagues. In Mary's circle, if Matilda is the female colleague, she doesn't have any other female colleagues there. If she's not the female colleague in Mary's circle, then she has 1 more female colleague.\n\nHowever, the question's phrasing suggests we're looking for a straightforward count from Matilda's perspective, considering her unique position. Since Matilda is definitely one of John's female colleagues, and there are 3 females in total in John's circle, she has 2 female colleagues in John's circle. For Mary's circle, since Matilda is the connection and there's only 1 female mentioned, if Matilda is this female, she has no additional female colleagues from Mary's side. \n\nSo, focusing strictly on the question's demand for the number of female colleagues Matilda has, without overcomplicating the circles:\n\n<answer>3</answer>",
