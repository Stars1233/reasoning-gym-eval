      "full_model_response": "To determine the rule, analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Erosion of Zeros**: Looking for where zeros in the input are replaced by 3s, we observe:\n   - Zeros between pairs of identical numbers (e.g., 8-8 followed by 0-0 then 1-1 in Example1) become 3-3.\n   - The first occurrence of a zero in even positions within a run starts the replacement with 3s, filling until another non-zero (not a pair) interrupts.\n\n2. **Replacement Pattern**:\n   - After each identical pair (XX), the following zeros are replaced from left to right until the next immediate non-paired number. For example, in Example1, after the pair 8-8, the zeros up to the next pair 1-1 are replaced. Post the 8-8 pair, only the first zero is converted to 3, with subsequent zeros marked to stop when a non-pair appears.\n   - In runs of zeros not bounded by pairs, the first zero in an even position is replaced by 3, continuing until another disruption.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n**Input**: 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0  \n1. **First segment**: After 4 (single), the run of two zeros (positions1-2) is between 4 and5-5. Replace with 3-3.  \n2. **5-5**: Next, after pair 5-5, zeros start. Three zeros: the first two form a pair (replaced to3-3), third remains 0.  \n3. **9's cluster**: 999 (three 9s). Runs after this are zeros. Replace the first zero in even/dieeven-like positions. Here, consecutive zeros after 999 start: 0000. Even-length, but since preceded by triplet (notpair), only the first followed by pairs modulated.\n\nThus, the output becomes:\n\n<output>4 3 3 5 5 3 3 0 9 9 9 3 3 0 0</output>",
