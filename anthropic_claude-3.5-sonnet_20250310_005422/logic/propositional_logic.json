The task is to infer a correct conclusion from the premise.\n\nFORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return the conclusion logic statement, as your final answer.\n- Use the following notation to denote symbols\n    - OR = \u2228\n    - AND = \u2227\n    - IMPLIES = \u2192\n    - IFF = \u2194\n    - NOT = \u00ac\n\nHere is the question:\nGiven:\n1. R\n.2. (P \u2192 S)\n.What can we conclude from the above statements?",

      "full_model_response": "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's identify what we know:\n   * We know R is true (given directly)\n   * We know P \u2192 S is true (if P is true, then S must be true)\n\n2) Looking at these premises:\n   * The first premise simply states R\n   * The second premise is a conditional statement\n   * There's no direct connection between R and (P \u2192 S)\n\n3) When we have disconnected premises:\n   * We can combine them with AND (\u2227)\n   * This is the most straightforward valid conclusion\n\n4) Therefore, we can conclude that both statements are true together:\n   R \u2227 (P \u2192 S)\n\n<answer>R \u2227 (P \u2192 S)</answer>",
