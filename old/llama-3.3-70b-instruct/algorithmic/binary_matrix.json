      "full_model_response": "<think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the taxicab (Manhattan) distance of the nearest 0 for each cell in the given matrix. We can start by initializing a distance matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix, where each cell is initially set to a large value (e.g., infinity). Then, we iterate over the input matrix and update the distance matrix as follows: for each cell containing a 0, we set the corresponding cell in the distance matrix to 0, since the distance to itself is 0. For each cell containing a 1, we calculate the Manhattan distance to the nearest 0 by checking the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) and update the distance matrix accordingly.\n\nWe can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to efficiently calculate the distances. We start by adding all cells containing a 0 to a queue, and then iteratively process each cell in the queue, updating the distances of its neighboring cells. We continue this process until all cells have been processed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. Initialize the distance matrix with infinity values.\n2. Iterate over the input matrix and add all cells containing a 0 to a queue.\n3. For each cell in the queue, update the distance matrix by setting the corresponding cell to 0.\n4. Process each cell in the queue, and for each neighboring cell containing a 1, calculate the Manhattan distance to the current cell and update the distance matrix if the new distance is smaller.\n5. Repeat step 4 until all cells have been processed.\n\nBy following this approach, we can efficiently calculate the taxicab distance to the nearest 0 for each cell in the input matrix.\n</think>\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n</answer>",

The taxicab distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|.\n\nThe cells with 0 are at (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 3), and (2, 3).\n\nFor cell (0, 1), the distance to the nearest 0 is 1 (to cell (0, 0)).\n\nFor cell (0, 2), the distance to the nearest 0 is 1 (to cell (0, 0) or cell (0, 3)), but since there's no direct 0 horizontally or vertically from this cell in the given setup, it seems there might have been a consideration for the setup provided, calculating the actual taxicab distances to each closest 0 point, the statement simplifies our approach without overcomplicating.\n\nFor cell (1, 0), the distance is 1 because it is horizontally adjacent to cell (0, 0) which is 0.\n\nFor cell (1, 1), it could reach 0 at (0, 0) or at (1, 3).

Then, we perform BFS from each cell in the queue, updating the distance matrix as we move to neighboring cells. The distance to each neighboring cell is the current cell's distance plus 1.\n\nWe iterate through the matrix to find all the cells with a value of 0 and add them to the queue. For each cell in the queue, we check its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and update their distances if the new distance (current cell's distance + 1) is less than the current distance in the distance matrix.\n\nThis process continues until the queue is empty, at which point the distance matrix will contain the shortest distance to a 0 for each cell in the original matrix.\n</think>\n<answer>\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1\n</answer>",
