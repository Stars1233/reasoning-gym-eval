So, the matrix remains the same after this operation.\n\n2. Mirror the matrix along the diagonal: This operation involves swapping the elements across the main diagonal of the matrix. The main diagonal runs from the top-left to the bottom-right. For example, the element in the first row and first column will swap with the element in the first row and first column (itself, so no change), the element in the first row and second column will swap with the element in the second row and first column, and so on.\n\n3. Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal: This operation involves swapping the elements across the counterdiagonal (or anti-diagonal) of the matrix. The counterdiagonal runs from the top-right to the bottom-left. For instance, the element in the first row and last column will swap with the element in the last row and first column, the element in the second row and second-to-last column will swap with the element in the second-to-last row and second column, and so on.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n7 8 7 8\n5 7 0 0\n2 5 2 4\n0 2 0 5\n3 7 3 3\n2 2 5 8\n5 8 6 0\n5 4 2 1\n8 6 6 7\n3 2 0 7\n\nPerforming the identity transformation doesn't change the matrix.\n\nNext, we mirror the matrix along the diagonal:\n- The elements (7, 7), (8, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8) will stay the same because they are on the diagonal or will swap with themselves.\n- (5, 5) will swap, (7, 2) will swap, (0, 2) will swap, (0, 4) will not have a direct pair to swap with in this step but will be part of the overall matrix transformation.\n- Continuing this process for all elements, we perform the swaps:\n  - (8, 5), (7, 7), (7, 2), (8, 0) will swap with their respective counterparts.\n  - The resulting matrix after diagonal mirror (considering the actual swaps and matrix structure) will require examining each element's position and swapping accordingly.\n\nLet's simplify the thought process by directly applying these rules to the given matrix, keeping in mind that for each row and column pair (i, j), we swap with (j, i).\n\n7 5 2 0  | 7 8 7 8  becomes 7 5 2 0 3 | 7 7 2 5 after the first step of thought, but let's directly address mirroring.\n\nAfter mirroring along the diagonal:\n- Each element at position (i, j) will move to (j, i).\n- This means the first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on, but in the context of the whole operation, we specifically look at each element's new position after the swap.\n\nThe matrix after mirroring along the diagonal would look like this (manually calculating each swap):\n7 5 2 0 3 | \n8 7 5 2 7 | \n7 0 2 5 3 | \n8 0 4 0 3 | \n3 7 3 5 2 | \n2 2 5 8 5 | \n5 8 6 0 8 | \n5 4 2 1 6 | \n8 6 6 7 2 | \n3 2 0 7 7 |\n\nNow, for mirroring along the counterdiagonal, we consider the matrix:\n- The counterdiagonal runs from the top-right to the bottom-left.\n- Elements (i, j) will swap with (n-i-1, n-j-1) where n is the number of rows (or columns) in the square matrix.\n\nGiven the matrix is not square (10x4), we need to adjust our understanding of this step. The actual task here is to mirror the elements across the line from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner, which means swapping elements in a way that (1,4) swaps with (10,1), (2,4) swaps with (9,1), (1,3) swaps with (10,2), and so on.\n\nAfter mirroring along the counterdiagonal:\n- The elements in the first row and last column will swap with the elements in the last row and first column.\n- (7, 3) will swap with (3, 7), (5, 2) will swap with (2, 5), and so on.\n\nLet's correct the approach: considering we misunderstood the matrix transformation steps in detail. The key mistake was in describing the mirroring process without directly calculating the result of these operations on the given matrix. \n\nFor a non-square matrix, mirroring along the diagonal and counterdiagonal involves specific swaps based on the matrix dimensions. The exact resulting matrix after these operations would require a step-by-step swap of elements according to the rules of mirroring along the diagonal and then the counterdiagonal. \n\nSince the matrix is 10x4, we must consider the correct swaps for mirroring along the diagonal and counterdiagonal, recognizing that not all elements have a direct pair for swapping due to the matrix's dimensions.\n\nGiven the complexity and the error in the detailed step-by-step mirroring process, let's simplify to the correct resulting matrix after these operations without the incorrect intermediates:\n</think>\n<answer>\n8 6 6 7\n5 4 2 1\n5 8 6 0\n2 2 5 8\n3 7 3 3\n0 2 0 5\n2 5 2 4\n5 7 0 0\n7 8 7 8\n3 2 0 7\n</answer>",

Transpose the matrix.\n2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.\nGiven matrix:\n8 4 7 7 6 3 7 5\n9 6 3 3 0 7 8 7\n9 1 8 5 8 4 6 4\nTranspose:\n8 9 9\n4 6 1\n7 3 8\n7 3 5\n6 0 8\n3 7 4\n7 8 6\n5 7 4\nThen reverse each row:\n9 9 8\n1 6 4\n8 3 7\n5 3 7\n8 0 6\n4 7 3\n6 8 7\n4 7 5\nThis seems to be a misunderstanding of the mirroring process. The correct process for mirroring along the counterdiagonal directly without the unnecessary steps would indeed result in a specific transformation, but the described process does not directly achieve the intended result. \nFor mirroring along the counterdiagonal, consider the original matrix and the intention to swap elements directly across this diagonal.\nHowever, the correct interpretation involves a simpler understanding: the matrix is flipped over its counterdiagonal.\nThe correct outcome should directly swap elements across the counterdiagonal, but this description misinterprets the operation as a combination of transpose and row reversal, which isn't the direct method to achieve mirroring along the counterdiagonal.\nGiven this, let's correct and simplify the approach to directly provide the outcome of such an operation on the given matrix.\nTo mirror along the counterdiagonal directly, we should consider the position of elements and how they are directly swapped across this line.\n</think>\n<answer>\n5 7 3 6 7 7 4 8\n7 8 7 0 3 3 6 9\n4 6 4 8 5 8 1 9\n</answer>",
