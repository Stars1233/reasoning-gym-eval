Since 2754 and 4777 do not share common prime factors easily seen, let's consider if there's a straightforward way to simplify without extensive factorization. Given the numbers do not share obvious common factors other than 1, the fraction is likely already in its simplest form or requires a more detailed factorization to find a GCD greater than 1. Upon closer inspection or calculation, one might realize the need for a more systematic approach like the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.
