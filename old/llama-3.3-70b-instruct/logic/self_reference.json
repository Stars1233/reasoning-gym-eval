Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nConsidering the implications:\n- If Statement 3 is true (exactly 5 true statements), then 2 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 5 true) and makes Statement 4 false. The number of true statements (5) is indeed a prime number (satisfying Statement 6), and the number of false statements (2) is not composite, which complicates the direct satisfaction of all statements under this scenario without considering the others.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can deduce potential truths:\n- Statement 2 must be false.\n- If Statement 3 is true, it satisfies the prime condition but does not align with a composite number of false statements without further analysis of the others.\n- Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, not both.\n\nFurther analysis:\n- For Statement 6 to be true (prime number of true statements), and considering Statement 1's requirement (at least 5 true), the only prime number of true statements that satisfies this and is less than or equal to 7 is 5 or 7. \n- Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) could be satisfied if there are 4 or 6 false statements, but given Statement 1, we are limited to 2 or fewer false statements for 5 or more true statements.\n\nConsidering all statements together:\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (Statement 3), then Statement 4 is false. This scenario does satisfy the \"at least 5 true\" from Statement 1 but leaves us to determine the truthfulness of the other statements under this condition.\n\nThe critical insight is realizing which statements can coexist as true without contradictions:\n- Statement 2 is false.\n- If Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false. This leaves us with Statements 1, 3, 5, and 6 potentially being true, with Statements 2, 4, and 7's truth values dependent on the exact distribution of true and false statements.\n\nHowever, realizing the constraint that Statement 5 imposes (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both), and knowing that for any given distribution of true and false, some statements will directly contradict others or themselves upon closer inspection, we need to systematically assess the validity of each statement against the others.\n\nUltimately, the question seems to lead towards a logical puzzle where some statements directly influence the potential truth values of others, requiring a careful consideration of each statement's implication on the others. \n\nUpon closer examination, the interplay between these statements, especially with the constraints provided by Statements 1, 5, and 6, and considering the nature of prime and composite numbers as applied to true and false statements, reveals a complex web of potential truths and falsehoods that must be navigated to determine the exact number of solutions.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 1 </answer>",

However, it does not directly align with Statement 7 because 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\nGiven the constraints, the only way for all these statements to hold true in a consistent manner is if exactly 5 statements are true, which happens if we consider the truths of Statements 3 or 4 (despite Statement 5's assertion that only one can be true, they essentially convey the same condition). This satisfies the condition of having a prime number of true statements (Statement 6) but creates a contradiction with Statement 7 since 2 false statements do not meet the composite criterion.\n\nReevaluating, we realize the critical point of contention and misunderstanding lies in the interpretation of Statements 3, 4, and 7 together.

At least 2 true statements (Statement 1).\n2. At most 3 false statements (Statement 2).\n3. Exactly 5 true statements as per Statements 3 and 4, which indirectly satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n4.

This means that if either of these is true, the condition in Statement 5 that only one can be true is actually a given, since they're functionally identical in outcome, despite the framing.\n\nStatement 1 (at least 6 true) cannot coexist with Statements 3 and 4 (exactly 5 true), as they describe different totals of true statements.\n\nStatement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) can be satisfied if there are 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements, as these are the prime numbers less than 7.\n\nStatement 7 (the number of false statements is composite) can be satisfied with 4 or 6 false statements (composite numbers less than 7), but since we're discussing the truthfulness of statements that would result in exactly 1 or 0 false statements to fulfill other conditions (like Statement 1), it's more relevant to note that 2, 4, and 6 are the composite numbers relevant here, meaning the number of false statements being 2 or more could satisfy this, under normal circumstances.\n\nGiven the statements' constraints:\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), then 2 must be false. This would make Statement 1 false and satisfy Statement 5's condition indirectly because Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true in the sense of providing different outcomes (though they describe the same outcome).\n- For the prime number of true statements (Statement 6), having exactly 5 true statements satisfies this.\n- The number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) is also satisfied with 2 false statements.\n\nTherefore, the key to solving this is recognizing which statements can be true together without contradicting each other and which ones must be false to satisfy all given conditions.\n\nGiven that we need exactly 5 true statements to satisfy the majority of these conditions without direct contradiction (except for Statement 1, which cannot be true if 5 statements are true), the configuration that seems plausible is having Statements 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as true. Statement 2 is always true in this context (as 7 or fewer statements are false), and it does not restrict our outcomes significantly. \n\nStatement 7 could potentially conflict with having 2 false statements if we strictly interpret composite to mean \"having more than two factors,\" which 2 (the number of false statements in this scenario) does not satisfy. However, 2 is indeed considered a composite number in some mathematical definitions that include any positive integer with at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself, but in the strictest sense, 2 is a prime number. \n\nThe critical insight, however, comes from recognizing that Statements 3 and 4 essentially demand the same outcome, and this can coexist with Statements 5 and 6 being true under the condition that exactly 5 statements are true. This scenario makes Statement 1 false and potentially satisfies all other statements given the specific definitions and implications.\n\nThus, there's a configuration where Statements 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are true, making Statements 1 and 7 false based on the analysis. This is the most coherent scenario given the conditions.\n\nThis solution satisfies all the given conditions without contradiction when we consider the logical implications of each statement and their potential to be true or false in relation to each other.\n</think>\n<answer> 1 </answer>",

However, only the scenario with exactly 4 true statements (as suggested by Statements 3 and 4) fits the criteria of having a specific, unique solution that could satisfy the conditions of multiple statements simultaneously.\n- Given the support of Statement 5 for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true (but not both, though they imply the same outcome), and considering the constraints, the only feasible scenario under these conditions is having exactly 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which would make Statement 3 (or Statement 4, but not both due to Statement 5) true.\n\nNow, evaluating the feasibility of this solution against all statements:\n- If exactly 4 statements are true, Statement 1 is satisfied.\n- Statement 2 would be false because more than 1 statement is false.\n- Statement 3 would be true.\n- Statement 4 would also be true, but Statement 5 says only one of them can be true, creating a conflict if we consider both Statements 3 and 4 as separate entities that must adhere to Statement 5's condition without overlap in their truth conditions.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because 4 is not a prime, which creates a problem since we've based our analysis on achieving a state that satisfies multiple conditions simultaneously, indicating a need to reassess prime truth conditions.\n- Statement 7 is satisfied because 3 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number, it's actually a prime, which again points to a conflict in satisfying all conditions simultaneously as initially interpreted.\n\nReassessing, the error lies in assuming flexibility where Statement 5 and the prime requirement of Statement 6 might suggest a fixed state rather than flexibility. The condition of exactly 4 true statements does satisfy Statements 1 and 3 directly but conflicts with the interpretation of Statement 6 (since 4 is not prime) and the composite requirement of Statement 7 (since 3 is not composite). \n\nConsidering the strict definitions and constraints without overcomplicating the interpretation:\n- The statements collectively point towards a specific distribution of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction. However, upon closer examination, the conditions provided by the statements, especially regarding prime and composite numbers, introduce a complexity that suggests an evaluation of possible scenarios where all statements can be true or false without violating logical principles.\n\nGiven the constraints and resolving the seeming paradox:\n- The combination of statements, especially with the inclusion of prime and composite conditions, limits the possible scenarios significantly.

However, this creates a problem with Statements 3 and 4, which cannot both be true according to Statement 5.\n\n- Statement 2 suggests that at most 1 statement is false, which aligns with Statement 1 if we consider all statements could be true except for one, which would then make Statement 2 true and potentially one other statement false.\n\n- Statement 3 claims exactly 1 statement is true. If this were the case, then only Statement 3 could be true, making all other statements false, including Statement 4. This scenario contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n\n- Statement 4 states exactly 7 statements are false, which means all statements are false. This directly contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 3.\n\n- Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. Given the nature of these statements, if Statement 3 is true, then only one statement can be true, which would be Statement 3 itself, making all other statements, including Statement 4, false. If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which includes Statement 3, fulfilling the condition of Statement 5 but creating a paradox with the other statements.\n\n- Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible prime numbers of true statements out of 7 statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n- Statement 7 states the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are those that have more than two factors. For 7 statements, the possible composite numbers of false statements are 4 and 6, since 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not composite (1 is a special case, and 2, 3, 5, 7 are prime).\n\nConsidering all these statements, we must find a scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction. \n\nGiven Statement 1, all statements must be true, but this immediately conflicts with Statements 3 and 4, which cannot both be true. Statement 5 tries to resolve this by saying only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, but given their claims, this creates a paradox.\n\nStatement 6 and Statement 7 provide clues on the distribution of true and false statements but must align with the constraints of the other statements.\n\nUpon careful consideration, the only way for these statements to hold true without contradiction is if exactly one statement is false, as suggested by Statement 2, and this false statement must be chosen such that it does not violate the conditions set by the other statements. However, given the constraints, especially from Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5, we find that no combination can satisfy all conditions simultaneously without creating a paradox, especially considering the absolute claims made by Statements 1, 3, and 4.\n\nThus, the analysis reveals a complex web of contradictions and paradoxes, suggesting that finding a solution that satisfies all given statements might be impossible due to their mutually exclusive claims.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\nStatement 5 limits us to either Statement 3 or Statement 4 being true, but since Statement 3 is not viable, we consider Statement 4 (exactly 2 false, meaning 5 true) as a potential truth under Statement 5.\n\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. Given Statement 1 and Statement 2's constraints, and knowing Statement 3 is false, the viable options under Statement 6 are 5 true statements (since 2 and 3 true statements would not satisfy Statement 1 and Statement 2's combined implication of at least 4 true statements, and 7 is not possible because Statement 3 is false).\n\nStatement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. With exactly 2 false statements (as per Statement 4), this condition is not met because 2 is a prime number, not composite. However, if we consider the implication of having 5 true statements (making 2 false), it doesn't fit Statement 7's requirement directly because 2 (the number of false statements) is prime. But exploring further, if there are exactly 5 true statements, it means 2 statements are false, which fits Statement 4 but contradicts Statement 7 since 2 is not composite.\n\nConsidering all constraints and looking for a scenario that fits:\n- Statement 3 cannot be true.\n- Statement 4 could be true but leads to a contradiction with Statement 7.\n- Statement 6 suggests a prime number of true statements, and the only viable prime under these constraints is 5 (since 7 cannot be true due to Statement 3 being false, and 2 and 3 do not meet the at least 4 true statements criterion from Statements 1 and 2).\n- Statement 7 requires a composite number of false statements, which doesn't align with having exactly 5 true statements (hence 2 false, which is prime).\n\nThe statements create a complex web of possibilities, but essentially, the constraints provided, especially by Statements 6 and 7, limit the potential scenarios significantly. Given the necessity for the number of true statements to be prime and the constraints around true and false statements, we find that having exactly 5 true statements (and thus 2 false) seems a plausible scenario under some statements but doesn't fit all criteria perfectly, especially considering Statement 7's requirement for a composite number of false statements.\n\nHowever, analyzing further, if we have 5 true statements, this would indeed satisfy Statements 1, 2, 4, and 6 but would not satisfy Statement 7 since 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite. Given this, and considering Statement 5 which makes Statement 4 a potential truth, the real question becomes how many configurations can satisfy all given constraints simultaneously.\n\nGiven the above considerations and revisiting the logic:\n- If all statements but one are true (6 true, 1 false), this satisfies Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) but does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 1 false statement is not composite).\n- For 5 true statements and 2 false (as suggested by Statement 4), this does not satisfy Statement 7 due to the prime number of false statements.\n\nThe statements seem to lead to a logical contradiction when trying to satisfy all conditions simultaneously, especially with the constraints on prime and composite numbers of true and false statements. However, the task is to determine the number of possible solutions based on the given statements' truthfulness.\n\nUpon reevaluation:\n- Statement 3 being false means not all statements can be true.\n- Statement 5 indicates either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 becomes a point of interest.\n- Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements is prime.\n- Given these constraints, the direct interpretation of satisfying all statements under the given conditions leads to a narrow set of possibilities, primarily due to the restrictive nature of Statements 6 and 7.\n\nUpon detailed analysis, finding a set of statements that satisfy all conditions without contradiction proves challenging due to the interplay of prime and composite requirements and the limitations imposed by Statements 3 and 5. Essentially, we are looking for scenarios where the number of true statements is prime, and the number of false statements is composite, with at least 3 true and at most 3 false, which seems to converge on limited configurations due to the constraints.\n\nHowever, considering the logic and constraints provided, the puzzle essentially asks for the determination of viable configurations under these strict and somewhat conflicting conditions. The real crux lies in satisfying the prime and composite number requirements simultaneously with the true/false constraints, which upon closer inspection, reveals a complex landscape of possibilities that are significantly constrained.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

Statement 4 indicates exactly 5 statements are false, meaning exactly 2 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 1 and partially contradicts the implication of Statement 2.\n\n5. Statement 5 acts as a switch between Statement 3 and Statement 4, indicating one of them must be true but not both. Given the contradictions with other statements, especially Statement 1, we have to evaluate the feasibility of Statements 3 and 4 separately.\n\n6. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This gives us potential scenarios where the number of true statements could be any of these numbers.\n\n7. Statement 7 indicates the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This means the number of false statements could be either 4 or 6, implying 3 or 1 true statements, respectively, which does not directly align with the prime requirement from Statement 6 except potentially for scenarios where the number of true statements is prime.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's evaluate feasible scenarios:\n- If Statement 3 is true (exactly 4 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false, aligning with Statement 5's condition. However, 4 true statements do not satisfy Statement 6 since 4 is not a prime number.\n- If Statement 4 is true (exactly 2 true statements), it directly contradicts the possibility of Statement 3 being true, adhering to Statement 5. Two true statements satisfy the prime requirement of Statement 6 but do not align with the initial implications of Statements 1 and 2.\n\nConsidering all statements and their implications, we see that:\n- Statement 1 cannot be true because it requires all statements to be true, which contradicts the nature of Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n- The truth of Statement 3 or 4 must be exclusive, as per Statement 5, but both create contradictions with other statements when considered for truthfulness.\n- Statement 6 limits the number of true statements to prime numbers, and Statement 7 limits the number of false statements to composite numbers.\n\nEvaluating these constraints:\n- For exactly 2 true statements (Statement 4), we have 5 false statements, satisfying the composite number condition of Statement 7 but not directly satisfying the \"at least 7 true\" or \"at most 2 false\" conditions without contradiction.\n- For exactly 4 true statements (Statement 3), we don't satisfy the prime condition of Statement 6.\n\nHowever, the real crux lies in the self-referential nature and the restrictions imposed by the statements on the number of true and false statements. Given these constraints and the requirement for internal consistency within the set of statements, we must consider which statements can be true without causing a paradox.\n\nUpon closer inspection, a scenario where exactly 2 statements are true could potentially satisfy some conditions without immediate contradiction, especially considering Statements 6 and 7. But given the constraints, especially from Statements 1, 3, and 4, along with the conditional exclusivity stated in Statement 5, we find that constructing a scenario that satisfies all given conditions without paradox is challenging.\n\nUltimately, the analysis hinges on identifying a set of statements that can be true without violating the principles of logic or the specific constraints provided by the statements themselves. Given the complex interplay and the self-referential paradoxes that emerge from attempting to satisfy all conditions simultaneously, the solution requires identifying which statements can coexist as true without contradiction.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

This can be true or false depending on the actual distribution of true and false statements, but it tells us that the minimum number of true statements could be 3 or more.\n\nStatement 2 claims 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.' If true, then 6 out of 7 statements must be true. However, if Statement 2 is false, it implies more than one statement could be false, leaving room for a variable number of true statements.\n\nStatement 3 asserts 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' This is a direct claim that, if true, gives us a clear distribution (6 true, 1 false) but its truthfulness contradicts the structure of Statement 5, unless one considers it under the conditions of Statement 5.\n\nStatement 4 posits 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.' Similar to Statement 3, if this is true, then 5 out of the 7 statements must be true, which sets up an interesting scenario when comparing it with Statements 3 and 5.\n\nStatement 5 says 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' Given that Statements 3 and 4 cannot coexist as truths (since Statement 3 says exactly 6 are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 5 are true), this introduces a dependency that helps limit possible scenarios further.\n\nStatement 6 indicates 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Since 2, 3, 5, 7 are the prime numbers below 7 (the total number of statements), if this is true, the only possible prime number of true statements (under the constraints) is 5 (because Statements 3 cannot coexist as a truth condition without violating conditions with other statements).\n\nStatement 7 claims 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' A composite number is one with more factors than 1 and itself (like 4, 6). Given Statement 7 is saying the false statements must number in a non-prime manner, this conflicts or aligns in interesting ways depending on Statements 3, 4, and 6.\n\nConsidering these together:\n- Statement 1 must be true as there will indeed be at least 3 true statements to meet the given criteria across these scenarios.\n- Statements 2, 3, and 4 create limiting conditions that Statement 5 governs, acting as a decisive pivot for assessing overall truth compositions.\n- For a solution where both Statements 3 and 6 could theoretically be true, only one true distribution fits under both: Exactly 6 of these statements must be true. Yet, examining all given claims together under prime (Statement 6) or specific (Statement 3 and 4) truths shows direct incompatibility in their mutual satisfaction given constraints (notably the exclusivity presented by Statement 5). The key resides in Statements 6 and 7 which effectively direct us to having either exactly 5 statements as true to align with having a prime (Statement 6) and leaving exactly 2 as false for the composite falsity requirement under a more restrictive solution space under prime and not composite (where prime false distributions such as exactly one false will break the claim). \n\nUnder scrutiny, any statement claiming at least 6 as true clashes due to specified statement exclusions with others setting truths/falsities to either match exactly those descriptions or avoid prime distributions across available choices strictly speaking.\n\nBy breaking down how truth claims compete in logical possibility while evaluating consistency to given exclusivity, solution availability is indeed influenced by possible claim distributions constrained.\n\nGiven truth tables, implications from statement assertions as a part set under total condition sets considered.\n\n\n</think>\n<answer> 1 </answer>",

Since composite numbers are those with more than two factors (excluding 1 and themselves), this would apply to 4 or 6 false statements in this context (since 2 is the only even prime number and having 1 or 0 false statements would not meet the composite criteria due to the definitions of composite and prime numbers).\n\nConsidering Statement 1's requirement for at least 6 true statements, this leaves us with a narrow window of possibilities, primarily focusing on the validity of Statement 6 and its interaction with the other statements. \n\nIf exactly 6 statements are true, then only one is false.

The only prime number of true statements possible given the other constraints (especially from Statement 1 and the implication of Statement 2) is 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, given Statement 1's requirement for at least 4 true statements, 2 and 3 are not possible, leaving us with 5 or 7 as potential numbers of true statements. Since 7 true statements would mean 0 false statements, which is not composite, it contradicts Statement 7. Thus, 5 true statements (and 2 false statements, which is a prime, not composite, number) seem like a potential candidate, but this actually violates Statement 7 directly because 2 (the number of false statements in this scenario) is prime, not composite.\n\nNow, considering all statements together:\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), this would satisfy Statement 1 but would contradict Statement 2 unless we consider the statements' implications broadly. With exactly 4 true statements, Statement 6 is satisfied because 4 is not a prime (contradicting the requirement for the number of true statements to be prime), leading to a misunderstanding in the initial thought process. The correct approach should directly evaluate the feasibility of each statement given the constraints.\n\nCorrecting the thought process:\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime. Given the statements, the feasible prime numbers for true statements under these constraints would indeed be limited. However, since Statement 3 suggests exactly 4 true statements, and Statement 4 suggests exactly 3 false statements (which also amounts to 4 true statements), these directly conflict with Statement 6's requirement for a prime number of true statements because 4 is not prime.\n- The critical insight lies in recognizing the interplay between the statements and identifying any that directly contradict the conditions set by others, particularly focusing on the prime and composite requirements which significantly narrow down the possibilities.\n\nUpon a detailed examination, the feasibility of each statement under the given constraints and the implications of prime and composite numbers on the count of true and false statements reveals a complex interplay that suggests a reevaluation towards a simpler, direct approach to identifying valid solutions.\n\nGiven the complex interrelations and upon reevaluation:\n- We recognize the necessity to directly address the prime and composite conditions as stated, alongside the true and false statement counts. The error in initial reasoning stems from not directly applying these conditions to filter out impossible scenarios effectively.\n\nRevisiting the conditions with a focus on the requirements for prime true statements and composite false statements, alongside the other constraints, indicates a need to systematically assess each possible distribution of true and false statements against all given conditions to accurately determine the number of possible solutions.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

Statement 2 says at most 3 are false, which means at least 4 are true, reinforcing Statement 1. Statement 3 claims exactly 2 are true, which contradicts both Statements 1 and 2. Statement 4 claims all 7 are false, which directly contradicts Statements 1, 2, and 3. Statement 5 introduces a condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, which means we have to consider the implications of each being true separately. Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number, and Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nGiven Statement 4 (all statements are false), if this were true, it would immediately create a paradox because it would be a true statement among all false ones. Thus, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\nStatement 3 claims exactly 2 statements are true. If this were the case, considering Statement 5 (which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both), and knowing Statement 4 is false, then Statement 3 could potentially be one of the true statements. However, for Statement 3 to be true, we need exactly one more true statement. Statement 5 being true would fulfill this requirement because it states either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which aligns with our rejection of Statement 4.\n\nConsidering Statement 6, which says the number of true statements must be a prime number, the only prime number that fits the condition of having at least 4 true statements (from Statements 1 and 2) is 5 (since 2 and 3 are not possible given the requirements of Statements 1 and 2). Statement 7, claiming the number of false statements is a composite number, would be satisfied if there were 2 false statements (2 is the smallest composite number), given that we have 7 statements in total.\n\nIf we were to accept Statement 3 as true (exactly 2 statements are true), this would mean Statements 1, 2, and 6 could not be true because they all imply more than 2 true statements. However, if Statement 3 is true, and by extension, Statement 5 is also true (because it must be one of the true statements given our earlier logic about Statement 4 being false), this leaves us with a contradiction when trying to satisfy all other conditions, especially since we've established that more than 2 statements need to be true to fulfill the conditions of Statements 1, 2, and 6.\n\nTherefore, we need to consider the scenario where exactly 5 statements are true, as it satisfies the prime number condition of Statement 6 and allows for a composite number of false statements (2 false statements). The false statements would likely include Statement 3 (because it claims exactly 2 true statements) and another that doesn't contradict the overall logic. \n\nThis implies that Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 are true, and Statements 3 and 4 are false. This arrangement satisfies all conditions without contradiction: at least 4 statements are true (Statement 1), at most 3 are false (Statement 2), either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both (Statement 5, with Statement 3 being false), the number of true statements is a prime number (5, Statement 6), and the number of false statements is a composite number (2, Statement 7).\n\nThus, considering the logic and the constraints provided by each statement, there is exactly one possible solution that satisfies all conditions without leading to a paradox.\n</think>\n<answer> 1 </answer>",

This would make Statement 1 and Statement 2 true. For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements (4) does not fit its condition since 4 is not a prime number. Thus, Statement 6 must be false. For Statement 7, since the number of false statements is 3 (which is not composite), Statement 7 would also be false. This scenario leaves us with Statements 1, 2, and 3 as true, and Statements 4, 5, 6, and 7 as false, which fits all given conditions when considering the statements' direct implications.\n\n- Considering Statement 4 being true and Statement 3 being false due to Statement 5, it leads to the same analysis as above because both Statements 3 and 4 imply the same distribution of true and false statements.\n\n- Statement 5's condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both is inherently contradictory given their equivalent implications on the distribution of truthfulness. This means our main variable is whether Statement 3 or Statement 4 can independently satisfy all conditions without contradicting Statement 5's \"but not both\" clause, which they cannot due to their equivalent truth implications.\n\nGiven these analyses, the possible solution revolves around the truthfulness of Statements 1, 2, 3 (or 4, but due to Statement 5's phrasing, we consider the scenario where one is true and the other false based on their identical implications), and the falseness of Statements 5, 6, and 7 under the condition where exactly 4 statements are true and 3 are false. \n\nHowever, due to the constraint and the conditions provided, there's an inherent contradiction in how Statement 5 interacts with Statements 3 and 4, suggesting a simplification in our approach might overlook the complexity of logical interactions between these statements. \n\nGiven the constraints and upon closer inspection, the critical insight lies in the interaction between Statements 3, 4, and 5, alongside the prime and composite conditions. \n\nStatement 5 essentially forces a choice between Statement 3 and Statement 4, but given their implications are the same, this choice doesn't alter the number of true or false statements, just which one is \"true\" in a logical sense. \n\nIf exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), then the true statements could include Statements 1, 2, and either 3 or 4, with the rest being false. However, Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime, and 4 is not prime, creating a conflict unless we consider the statements' implications more flexibly.\n\nUpon a detailed examination, realizing that Statement 5 creates a paradox with Statements 3 and 4 due to their identical implications, and considering the prime and composite requirements, we find that:\n- For Statement 6 to be true (prime number of true statements), the possible numbers are 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n- For Statement 7 to be true (composite number of false statements), the possible numbers are 4 or 6 false statements, implying 3 or 1 true statements, respectively, which does not align with Statement 6's prime requirement for true statements in a straightforward manner without considering the implications of all statements together.\n\nGiven these conditions and realizing the potential for oversight in simplifying the interactions between statements, the solution hinges on identifying a set of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction, considering the prime, composite, and the \"at least,\" \"at most,\" \"exactly\" conditions provided.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward path to resolving the potential solutions involves recognizing the constraints imposed by each statement and how they interact.

The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7 suggests the number of false statements is a composite number.

Statement 5 supports the exclusivity of Statement 3 or Statement 4 but essentially points towards the same outcome of 4 true statements. Statement 6 allows for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements, but given Statement 1's requirement of at least 4 true statements, we narrow down to 5 or 7 true statements being possible under prime conditions. However, only 4 true statements satisfy both Statement 3 and Statement 4 without causing contradictions when considering the implications of all statements together.\n\nGiven that exactly 4 statements being true satisfies Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 without contradicting any of the other statements (since Statement 6 can be satisfied with a prime number of true statements and Statement 7 can be satisfied as 3 false statements make it composite), the most straightforward solution that fits all criteria is having exactly 4 true statements.\n\nNow, evaluating the statements for truthfulness based on this analysis:\n- Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 can be true.\n- Statement 2 is technically true but doesn't provide additional constraint.\n- Statement 6 can be true if we consider the prime number condition.\n- Statement 7 can be true if we have a composite number of false statements, which 3 false statements would not satisfy since 3 is prime, indicating a potential error in initial consideration regarding Statement 7's direct implications.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, realizing that Statement 7 actually requires the number of false statements to be composite (not prime), and having 3 false statements does indeed not fit this requirement since 3 is prime, the correct alignment under the constraints provided suggests that we must carefully match the conditions to the possible outcomes.\n\nIn essence, we are looking for a scenario where all given conditions can be satisfied without contradiction. Given the constraints and the implications of each statement on the others, the critical path involves satisfying the condition of having a specific number of true and false statements that align with all given statements' requirements.\n\nWe see that having exactly 4 true statements (thus, 3 false statements) seems to satisfy several conditions directly but does not align with Statement 7's requirement for a composite number of false statements. Since 3 is a prime number, not composite, this creates a conflict.\n\nConsidering the nature of the statements and their interrelations, let's reconsider the impact of each statement on the potential number of solutions:\n\n- The statements about the number of true or false statements being prime or composite (Statements 6 and 7) add specific constraints.\n- Statement 6 allows for 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements, given the prime condition.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite, meaning it cannot be 2, 3, 5, or 7 (the prime numbers less than 7), thus it has to be 4 or 6 false statements to fit the composite requirement within the context of 7 total statements.\n\nGiven these constraints and revisiting the implications of having exactly 4 true statements (which was the initial inclination based on Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5), we realize there's an error in assuming 4 true statements directly satisfy all conditions without considering the prime/composite requirements properly.\n\nActually, if we strictly follow the conditions without assuming the number of true/false statements beforehand:\n- For Statement 7 to be true, we need a composite number of false statements, which means 4 or 6 false statements (since 4 and 6 are the composite numbers less than 7).\n- Having 4 false statements means 3 true statements, which doesn't satisfy Statement 1's condition of at least 4 true statements.\n- Having 6 false statements means 1 true statement, which also doesn't satisfy Statement 1.\n\nThus, the initial approach to directly satisfy Statements 3 and 4 with 4 true statements seems to overlook the critical constraint imposed by Statement 7 regarding the composite nature of the false statements.\n\nRe-evaluating the statements for a consistent solution that satisfies all given conditions without contradiction requires a careful match of the prime and composite conditions with the statements about the number of true and false statements.\n\nUpon further reflection, considering all statements together:\n- Statement 1 requires at least 4 true statements.\n- Statement 3 suggests exactly 4 true statements.\n- Statement 4 also implies exactly 4 true statements (since 3 false statements would mean 4 true statements).\n- Statement 6 allows for a prime number of true statements, which could be 5 or 7 given the at least 4 true statements constraint from Statement 1.\n- Statement 7 requires a composite number of false statements, which could be 4 (if there are 3 true statements, which doesn't fit) or 6 (if there's 1 true statement, which doesn't fit either).\n\nThe key realization is that the conditions impose a narrow set of possible solutions, and upon closer inspection, it appears there might have been an oversight in the reconciliation of the prime/composite requirements with the specific counts of true/false statements as dictated by the various statements.\n\nGiven this complex interplay and the need to satisfy all conditions simultaneously without contradiction, let's correct the approach by focusing on the feasible combinations that meet all specified criteria, including the prime and composite conditions.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

If this is the case, then the maximum number of false statements can be 1. \n\nStatement 2 states that at most 5 of the statements are false, which implies that at least 2 of the statements must be true. \n\nStatement 3 says exactly 2 statements are true, and Statement 4 says exactly 2 statements are false. These two statements cannot both be true because if exactly 2 statements are true, then 5 are false, and vice versa. \n\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means we have two scenarios to consider based on Statement 5's condition.\n\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for true statements out of 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nStatement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for false statements out of 7 are 4 and 6, since 1 and 7 are not composite (1 is a unit, and 7 is a prime), 2 and 3 are primes, and 5 is also a prime.\n\nConsidering Statement 1, if at least 6 statements are true, this contradicts Statement 3 (exactly 2 true) and aligns with the possibility of Statement 4 (exactly 2 false), but given Statement 5, only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. Thus, if Statement 1 is true, Statement 3 must be false, and Statement 4 could potentially be true. However, Statement 6 and Statement 7 also need to be considered for a complete analysis.\n\nIf Statement 3 is true (exactly 2 statements are true), then Statement 4 must be false (as per Statement 5), and this would mean 5 statements are false, satisfying Statement 7's condition (since 5 is not composite, this actually doesn't satisfy it, indicating a potential contradiction). \n\nHowever, let's consider Statement 6, which requires the number of true statements to be a prime number. If exactly 2 statements are true, this satisfies Statement 6 because 2 is a prime number.\n\nFor Statement 4 to be true (exactly 2 statements are false), this means 5 statements are true, which satisfies Statement 6 (since 5 is a prime number) and potentially contradicts Statement 1 unless all statements including Statement 1 are among the true ones.\n\nGiven these constraints and analyzing each statement against the others, the only way all conditions can potentially be met without contradiction is if either exactly 2 statements are true (satisfying Statement 3, and by extension, Statement 5 if Statement 4 is false) or exactly 5 statements are true (satisfying Statement 6 and potentially aligning with Statement 1 if it's among the true statements).\n\nHowever, detailed examination reveals contradictions and complexities, especially considering the interplay between Statements 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Statement 1 suggests a majority of statements are true, directly opposing Statement 3. Since Statement 5 dictates only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, and given the constraints around prime and composite numbers for true and false statements, finding a combination that satisfies all without contradiction is challenging.\n\nIn reality, careful consideration shows that if Statement 3 is true (exactly 2 true), it leads to contradictions with other conditions when trying to fulfill all statements' requirements simultaneously, especially with Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and Statement 1 (at least 6 true). Similarly, if Statement 4 is true (exactly 2 false), this implies 5 true statements, which could align with some conditions but must be examined against all statements for consistency.\n\nUltimately, resolving these statements involves identifying a set of true and false assignments that satisfy all given constraints without contradiction, which upon deeper analysis, reveals the complexity and potential for limited or even no solutions that meet all criteria simultaneously due to the constraints provided, especially considering the implications of Statements 1, 3, 5, and 6 together.</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true, which would make Statement 4 false. If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true, making Statement 3 false.\n\nConsidering Statement 6, the number of true statements being a prime number gives us possible numbers of true statements as 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\nStatement 7 indicates the number of false statements is composite. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possibilities based on these constraints:\n\n1. **If 2 statements are true**, then 5 are false. This contradicts Statement 7 because 5 is a prime number, not composite.\n2. **If 3 statements are true**, then 4 are false. This fits Statement 7 (4 is composite), but it contradicts Statement 2 (at most 3 false) and doesn't satisfy Statement 5 directly.\n3. **If 5 statements are true** (as per Statement 3), then 2 are false. This fits Statement 6 (5 is prime) but contradicts Statement 7 (2 is prime, not composite).\n4. **If 7 statements are true**, then 0 are false. This doesn't fit Statement 7 (0 is not considered composite in this context) and also contradicts the premise that we are evaluating the truthfulness of statements which implies some could be false.\n\nGiven these constraints and considering Statement 5, if Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), it contradicts the requirement from Statement 7 that the number of false statements (2 in this case) should be composite. If Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), then 1 is false, which also doesn't fit because 1 is not composite.\n\nHowever, the key here is to find a scenario that satisfies all given conditions without contradiction. Statement 6 and Statement 7 together with Statement 5 provide a unique constraint. \n\nGiven the constraints and upon closer inspection, we realize that we need a situation where the number of true statements is prime and the number of false statements is composite, and either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true exclusively.\n\nThe only scenario that fits all conditions without contradiction, considering the prime and composite constraints and the exclusivity of Statements 3 and 4, is when **exactly 5 statements are true** (making Statement 3 true and thus Statement 4 false), which would normally seem to fit some criteria but actually doesn't satisfy the composite requirement for false statements since 2 (the number of false statements in this scenario) is prime. \n\nHowever, re-evaluating the logic and focusing on the requirement for the number of false statements to be composite and the number of true statements to be prime, and considering Statement 5's implication that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true:\n\n- If we have **exactly 6 true statements** (Statement 4 is true), then we have 1 false statement, which does not fit the composite requirement for false statements since 1 is not composite.\n\nThus, the initial analysis may seem to suggest no direct solution fits all criteria perfectly without contradiction, especially considering the misinterpretation of the composite and prime requirements together with the statements' constraints. \n\nHowever, the critical insight comes from recognizing the potential for satisfying the prime and composite conditions alongside the statements' constraints. Given the strict definitions and the apparent contradictions in initial analyses, let's correct the approach:\n\nGiven that a statement like \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true\" directly implies 2 are false, and considering the prime and composite number constraints, the analysis should focus on the feasibility of each statement being true or false based on these numerical constraints and the logical constraints provided by the statements themselves.\n\nUpon a detailed examination, considering all possible combinations and the constraints provided by each statement, it appears the analysis overlooked the direct implications of Statements 6 and 7 together, which severely limit the possible scenarios. \n\nGiven this, the solution must adhere to the prime number of true statements and the composite number of false statements, alongside the other constraints. \n\nThe error in the initial reasoning process was in not systematically eliminating possibilities based on all constraints simultaneously and not correctly applying the prime and composite number conditions to the statements' implications on the total number of true and false statements.\n\nCorrectly, one must consider the implications of each statement on the total count of true and false statements, applying the constraints of prime and composite numbers to these counts, and ensuring that the conditions of Statements 1 through 5 are met without contradiction.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

Statement 5 being true would validate Statement 4, suggesting 4 true statements. This aligns with Statement 1. \n\nHowever, we must consider the prime and composite conditions. A prime number of true statements (Statement 6) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7, given there are 7 statements. A composite number of false statements (Statement 7) could be 4 or 6, given the total is 7.\n\nIf exactly 4 statements are true (as per Statement 4 and supported by Statement 1), this satisfies the condition of having a composite number of false statements (3 is not composite, but 4 is not the number of false statements in this scenario; it's the number of true statements). However, 4 is not a prime number, contradicting Statement 6 if we consider 4 true statements.\n\nConsidering Statement 6, if the number of true statements is a prime number, and given that Statement 3 is false, the possible number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, Statement 1 requires at least 4 true statements, narrowing it down to 5 or 7 true statements for prime conditions.\n\nFor 5 true statements, this would mean 2 false statements, which is a prime number, not composite, contradicting Statement 7.\n\nFor 7 true statements, all statements including Statement 3 would be true, which is impossible since Statement 3 claims all statements are false.\n\nThus, the only feasible scenario under these constraints seems to be having 4 true statements (which doesn't directly satisfy the prime condition but let's re-evaluate the statements for consistency):\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true because 4 true statements mean 3 false statements.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because 3 (the number of false statements) is not composite, but this seems to be a point of contention based on initial analysis.

Given the contradictions between the statements, if Statement 3 is true, then only 3 statements can be true, which directly contradicts the conditions set by Statements 1 and 2. If Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true, which fits within the bounds set by Statements 1 and 2.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This means the possible number of true statements could be any of these, but given the constraints from Statements 1 and 2, only 5 and 7 are viable options under certain conditions.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that the number of false statements could be 4 (making 3 true statements, which contradicts most statements) or 6 (making 1 true statement, which also contradicts most statements).\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Statement 3 cannot be true because it contradicts the conditions set by Statements 1 and 2.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true, which satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and could potentially satisfy Statement 6 if 6 is considered under a broader interpretation of 'prime' conditions indirectly through the lens of potential misinterpretation, but directly, 6 is not prime.\n- Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, but given the contradictions, if we follow the logic that allows for the most consistency across the statements (ignoring the direct contradictions), Statement 4 being true offers a pathway to satisfy several conditions simultaneously.\n- However, considering Statement 6 strictly (the number of true statements is a prime number), and given that 6 is not a prime number, this creates a tension. The only prime number that could satisfy the conditions given by Statements 1 and 2 is 7 (all statements being true), but this would make Statement 7 false (since 0 false statements is not composite), creating a paradox unless we accept that some statements must be false to satisfy the conditions of others.\n\nConsidering the strict definitions and implications:\n- For all statements to be true, we hit a paradox with Statement 7 (since 0 false statements are not composite).\n- Statement 3 being true contradicts too many conditions, so it's unlikely to be part of a solution.\n- Statement 4 being true (6 true statements) could satisfy several conditions but contradicts the prime requirement directly for the number of true statements.\n\nThus, finding a solution that satisfies all given conditions without contradiction is challenging due to the inherent paradoxes and contradictions within the set of statements. However, exploring potential solutions based on the constraints:\n- If exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 4 is true), this could potentially satisfy Statements 1, 2, and 5 (if we consider Statement 3 as false, which it must be for Statement 4 to be true). However, Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) is not satisfied because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 would also not be satisfied under this condition because 1 false statement is not composite.\n\nGiven these considerations, there seems to be a misunderstanding in directly applying these statements to find a numerical solution without considering the logical inconsistencies and paradoxes they create. The question seems to aim at understanding the logical approach to solving such puzzles rather than arriving at a straightforward numerical answer.\n\nHowever, if we are to determine the \"number of possible solutions\" based on the logic that can be consistently applied across these statements without directly violating their conditions, we find that the constraints provided limit the viable scenarios significantly, essentially to a point where satisfying all conditions simultaneously becomes logically inconsistent due to the inherent contradictions and paradoxes present in the statements.\n\nTherefore, considering the aim is to find a logical pathway that respects the conditions given while acknowledging the presence of contradictions and the challenge in satisfying all statements simultaneously, the process involves identifying the constraints and implications of each statement on the potential number of true and false statements among the given set.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 6 statements are true, which would make Statement 4 false. Conversely, if Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true, making Statement 3 false.\n\nConsidering Statement 6, the number of true statements being a prime number means it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7 (the total number of statements).\n\nStatement 7 indicates the number of false statements is composite.

This aligns with Statement 7 because 3 is not composite, but it was an oversight in initial reasoning; 3 is indeed not composite, it's prime. However, considering the conditions, if 4 statements are true, it fits Statement 6 (since 4 is not prime, this was another oversight; the correct consideration should be on the prime number of true statements as per Statement 6, which are 2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\nCorrecting the thought process:\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite (4, 6).\n\nGiven Statement 5, and correcting the analysis:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are true, and 1 is false, which does not fit Statement 7.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are true, and 3 are false, which does not fit Statement 7 directly because 3 is prime, not composite.\n\nHowever, re-evaluating the conditions with corrected understanding:\n- Statement 1 (at least 2 true) and Statement 2 (at most 2 false) must both be true to satisfy the initial conditions without contradicting each other, suggesting a majority of statements are true.\n- Statement 5 indicates only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.

This means we have two scenarios to consider: one where Statement 3 is true (and thus only 1 statement is true), and one where Statement 4 is true (and thus exactly 2 statements are true).\n\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number.

Composite numbers up to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies that the number of false statements could be 4 or 6, meaning the number of true statements could be 3 or 1 (since 7 - 4 = 3 and 7 - 6 = 1), respectively.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's find a scenario that satisfies all conditions:\n\n1. If Statement 3 is true (exactly 1 true statement), then Statement 4 must be false (according to Statement 5), which fits because if only 1 statement is true, not exactly 5 can be false. However, this scenario contradicts Statement 1 (at least 5 true) and Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) since 1 is not considered a prime number in most mathematical contexts relevant here.\n\n2. If Statement 4 is true (exactly 2 true statements), it directly contradicts Statement 1 (which requires at least 5 true statements) and Statement 6 (since 2 is a prime number, but the conditions from other statements are not met for exactly 2 true statements).\n\nConsidering Statement 6, for the number of true statements to be a prime number, and given the restrictions, the only feasible prime number of true statements that could satisfy the conditions when considering all statements is 5 (since 2 and 3 do not satisfy the \"at least 5 true\" from Statement 1, and 7 would imply all statements are true, which contradicts the premise that some are false).\n\nFor exactly 5 true statements:\n- Statement 1 is true because 5 is at least 5.\n- Statement 2 is true because having 5 true statements means 2 are false, which is at most 4 false.\n- Statement 3 is false because it claims only 1 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false because it claims exactly 5 are false, which would mean 2 are true.\n- Statement 5 is false because it states either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both, and in this scenario, neither is true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because having 2 false statements means the number of false statements is indeed not a composite number as defined in the usual sense for this problem context (since we're considering the impact of each statement's truthfulness), but this creates a contradiction since 2 is indeed considered a prime number, not a composite number in the context usually relevant for such logical puzzles.\n\nHowever, the above analysis reveals a misunderstanding in directly applying Statement 7's condition without considering the usual definition of composite and prime numbers. Correctly, if we have 5 true statements, 2 are false, which does indeed make the number of false statements (2) a prime number, not a composite number, indicating an error in the direct application of Statement 7's condition in the context provided.\n\nThe correct approach should focus on the feasibility of each statement being true or false based on the conditions given, recognizing the potential for contradiction and the necessity for consistency across all statements.\n\nGiven the constraints and upon reevaluation:\n- The critical insight is recognizing that Statement 5 (Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both) and the conditions around prime and composite numbers limit the possible scenarios significantly.\n- Statement 6 (The number of true statements is a prime number) and Statement 7 (The number of false statements is a composite number) provide specific numerical constraints.\n- For a scenario to satisfy all given conditions without contradiction, it must adhere to the numerical constraints (prime true statements, composite false statements) and the logical conditions (at least 5 true, at most 4 false, etc.).\n\nUpon closer inspection, satisfying all conditions simultaneously without contradiction proves challenging due to the restrictive nature of the statements, particularly the interplay between the requirements for prime and composite numbers of true and false statements, respectively.\n\nThe realization that no combination can satisfy all statements without contradiction leads to the conclusion that there are limited or no solutions that meet all the given criteria simultaneously, given the constraints and the logical framework provided.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

Specifically, the truth of Statements 3 or 4 (suggesting 5 true and 2 false) contradicts Statement 6 (since 5 is not a prime outcome in this context due to the misunderstanding of its primality in the explanation) and does not align with Statement 7 (since 2 false statements is a prime number, not composite).\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection and correcting the analysis:\n- If exactly 5 statements are true (as per Statements 3 and 4), this would indeed mean 2 are false, which does align with some of the given conditions but creates a contradiction with the requirement for the number of false statements to be composite (Statement 7) since 2 is prime.\n\nThe key to resolving these statements lies in identifying the consistent scenarios that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction, focusing on the prime number of true statements and the composite number of false statements.\n\nGiven the misinterpretation in the initial analysis regarding the primality of the number 5 and the conditions set forth by the statements, let's correct the course and directly evaluate the feasibility of each statement in conjunction with the others, recognizing the error in handling the primality and compositeness conditions.\n\nUpon reevaluation:\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7). \n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite (4, 6, given the context).\n\nThe only configuration that could potentially satisfy both the prime requirement for true statements and the composite requirement for false statements, while also considering the constraints of the other statements, is having 5 true statements and 2 false statements. However, this directly contradicts Statement 7 since 2 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\nThus, the initial approach to directly solve based on the given conditions and the subsequent realization of the oversight in handling the prime and composite numbers indicates a complex interplay of conditions that are difficult to satisfy simultaneously without contradiction.\n\nGiven the corrected understanding and focusing strictly on the conditions without overcomplicating the primality and compositeness requirements:\n- The condition that the number of true statements is prime and the number of false statements is composite, coupled with the other statements, suggests a specific setup. However, upon careful consideration, it becomes apparent that satisfying all conditions simultaneously is challenging due to the inherent contradictions and the specific nature of prime and composite numbers in relation to the total number of statements.\n\nTherefore, considering the strict definitions and the implications of each statement on the others, the solution must adhere to the logical constraints provided, acknowledging the potential for oversight in the initial analysis regarding the satisfaction of prime and composite conditions.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

However, if all statements are true, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5's claim that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both could hold, as Statement 3 would be true and Statement 4 false.\n\n4. Statement 4 says exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false, implying 2 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and potentially supports Statement 5 if Statement 3 is the other true statement, but it does not hold because Statement 4 itself claims 5 false statements, which includes itself and Statement 3 as false if it were to be considered as one of the true statements alongside another.\n\n5. Statement 5 indicates only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. Given the mutual exclusivity of Statements 3 and 4, Statement 5 has to be carefully evaluated against these statements' truths.\n\n6. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements is a prime number. This could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. If 7 statements are true (as Statement 3 suggests), this is a prime scenario, supporting both Statements 1 and 6.\n\n7. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. This means the false statements could be 4 or 6 (since 2, 3, 5, and 7 are primes and not composite in the set of possible outcomes from 1 to 7 statements).\n\nFrom the analysis, we see conflicts and potential inconsistencies that narrow down the possibilities for true and false statements. We have to ensure that the truths of these statements do not self-contradict when taking into account what each statement implies about the set of statements.\n\nFor instance, Statement 4 cannot be true because if it were, this would mean Statement 3 must be false among the 5 false statements. But if only 2 statements are true as per Statement 4, it would not directly align with having more than two statements being considered for truth based on other constraints, especially under the conditions outlined by Statements 1, 3, and 6. Statement 1, being the most inclusive in terms of statements being true, allows for compatibility with Statements 3 and 6 under a specific condition that maximizes the number of true statements without reaching an outright logical contradiction.\n\nEvaluating consistency and the necessity for statements not to contradict when determining their individual and collective truths:\n\n- All statements being true (as suggested by Statement 3) provides a straightforward starting point but hits against the impossibility of this given the statement structure ( Statements 3 and 4, with Statement 5 acting as a gatekeeper, imply not all can be true due to mutual exclusivities).\n\n- More specifically, examining the prime/composite nature via Statements 6 and 7 hints at conditions where having either a prime number of true statements (2, 3, 5, or 7) or ensuring a composite (non-prime) number of false statements plays into evaluating all potential truth allocations.\n\nConsidering this framework, for Statements 6 and 7 to hold in a manner not conflicting with our basic logical axioms and these specific statements about statement counts being prime or composite, we deduce the allocation must fit all stated constraints to identify a truth allocation that aligns with them.\n\nHowever, direct calculation can sometimes obviate the complex deductive sequence needed to exhaustively enumerate outcomes and evaluate every implication. Statements about truth can inherently lead to logical contradictions based on the setup. \n\nEvaluating, Statement 4's assertion inherently suggests its truth necessitates that Statement 4 is among those that are true. Yet for all statements other than itself, being false seems infeasible as per constraint checks and considering validity across implications laid forth.\n</think>\n<answer> 1 </answer>",

Since 4 is not a prime number, this creates a conflict if we consider the statements individually without considering the constraints they impose on each other.\n\nStatement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the conditions imposed, particularly by Statements 6 and 7, in conjunction with the mutually exclusive nature of Statements 3 and 4 as dictated by Statement 5, lead to a complex logical puzzle.\n\nUltimately, the puzzle's solution hinges on identifying a configuration that does not violate any of the given constraints while also adhering to the principles of logic regarding true and false statements.\n\nHowever, upon deeper analysis, given the constraints and the specific nature of the statements, it appears that the setup provided leads to a situation where satisfying all conditions simultaneously is highly constrained, if not impossible, due to the contradictions and the specific requirements regarding prime and composite numbers.\n\nThus, considering the interplay of these statements and their requirements, we need to evaluate if there's indeed a feasible solution that meets all the criteria without violating logical principles or the specific constraints provided by the statements themselves.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then only one statement is false. Given Statement 5's condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and since Statement 3 cannot be true, Statement 4 being true suggests that the rest of the statements, except one, must be true. This creates a paradox because if all statements except Statement 3 and one other are true, it would fulfill some conditions but contradict others, particularly because Statement 4 being true means only one false statement, which could align with Statement 2 but not with Statement 1 if we're considering the minimums and maximums mentioned.\n\nGiven these considerations, the statements create a complex web of conditions. However, a direct examination reveals that only specific configurations could potentially satisfy all given conditions without immediate contradiction. \n\nFor instance, if Statement 4 is true, and thus only one statement is false, this means that 6 statements are true.

Given the web of constraints and potential for logical contradiction, the problem simplifies to identifying which of these statements can coexist truthfully.\n\nGiven the constraints and aiming to resolve the issue directly: \nConsidering all statements and their implications, the number of possible solutions can be derived by examining the constraints and potential configurations that satisfy all conditions simultaneously without contradiction.</think>\n<answer> 0 or 1 </answer>",

      "full_model_response": "<think> \nTo solve this problem, let's first analyze the statements and their implications. \n\nStatement 1 implies that at least 6 statements are true, which means 1 or 0 statements are false. \nStatement 2 implies that at most 2 statements are false, which means 5 or more statements are true. \nStatement 3 says exactly 6 statements are true, which means 1 statement is false. \nStatement 4 claims all statements are true, which is a direct statement and doesn't provide a range. \nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but they cannot both be true. Since Statement 4 claims all statements are true, it cannot be true if any other statement indicates the existence of a false statement. Thus, if Statement 4 is true, all other statements must align with it being true. \nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number, which means it could be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7. \nStatement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number, meaning it could be 4 or 6 since these are the composite numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\nGiven Statement 3 and Statement 4, and considering Statement 5, we have two initial scenarios to consider: one where exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3 is true), and one where all 7 statements are true (Statement 4 is true). However, if Statement 4 is true, then all statements must be true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 5's condition that they cannot both be true. Thus, the scenario where all statements are true (Statement 4) is not possible because it would make Statement 3 false, and Statement 5 would be false as well, which already gives us 2 false statements, contradicting the premise of Statement 4.\n\nSo, we focus on the scenario where exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3 is true). If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false (because of Statement 5). With Statement 3 being true, we have exactly 6 true statements and 1 false statement. \n\nThis setup makes Statement 1 true because at least 6 statements are true. It also makes Statement 2 true because at most 2 statements are false (in this case, only 1 is false). \n\nFor Statement 6, the number of true statements being 6 is not a prime number, which means Statement 6 is false. \n\nFor Statement 7, having exactly 1 false statement means the number of false statements is not a composite number, making Statement 7 false as well.\n\nNow we have: \n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: False\n- Statement 5: True (because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both)\n- Statement 6: False (because 6 is not a prime number)\n- Statement 7: False (because 1 is not a composite number)\n\nThis gives us a total of 4 true statements and 3 false statements, which contradicts our initial setup based on Statement 3 being the only possible truth scenario under the constraints. However, upon reevaluation, we see that our initial interpretation missed the mark on how these statements interact, especially with the conditions set by Statements 5, 6, and 7. \n\nReevaluating the statements with the correct interpretation of their implications and the constraints they impose:\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, all statements must be true, which cannot be the case because Statement 5 dictates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. So, if Statement 4 were true, it would make Statement 5 false, which is a contradiction. Thus, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\nGiven the complexity and the mistake in the logical deduction process above, let's simplify and correct the approach:\n\n- The statements create a puzzle where the truth of one affects the others. \n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true due to Statement 5. \n- If exactly 6 statements are true (Statement 3), this would make Statement 4 false, and given the conditions, it's possible to satisfy the other statements in a way that adheres to their claims, but upon careful examination, the initial analysis overlooked the potential for satisfying the conditions given by the other statements in a manner consistent with logical principles.\n\nUpon correction and further reflection, considering the implications of each statement on the others and the requirement for consistency across all true statements, the analysis reveals a need to carefully match the statements against the possible truth values they can take without violating the principles of logic or the specific claims made within the statements.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 1 </answer>",

Since there are only 7 statements in total, this means all 7 statements must be true for Statement 1 to be true. However, this immediately creates a contradiction with Statement 4, which claims that exactly 7 of the statements are false.

Thus, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n- Statement 1 cannot be true because it requires all statements to be true, which contradicts the nature of Statement 4 and the logical analysis of the other statements.\n- For Statement 3 to be true (exactly 3 statements are true), it must be one of the true statements. Given Statement 5, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false. Statement 3 being true also satisfies Statement 6 (since 3 is a prime number) and Statement 7 (since 4 is a composite number and would be the number of false statements).\n\nGiven these considerations, let's analyze potential truth values that satisfy all statements without contradiction:\n1. Statement 3 being true allows for exactly 3 true statements, which could include itself, Statement 5 (because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both), and one other. This scenario doesn't contradict any other statement directly when considering the specific conditions they impose.\n\nHowever, upon deeper analysis, the compatibility of these statements under the constraints provided reveals that finding a set that satisfies all conditions without contradiction is challenging due to the nature of self-referential paradoxes and the specific claims made by each statement.\n\nGiven Statement 6, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7), and given Statement 7, the number of false statements must be a composite number (4 or 6), which aligns with the possibilities of 3 true statements (and thus 4 false statements) as the most plausible scenario under these constraints.\n\nBut, to directly solve the problem based on logical consistency without overcomplicating the analysis:\n- The critical insight comes from recognizing that some statements directly contradict each other or themselves upon closer examination, especially when considering the implications of Statements 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 together.\n\nGiven the constraints and the process of elimination based on the statements' claims, we need to find a combination that satisfies all conditions without contradiction.

Statement 6 states the number of true statements is a prime number, and Statement 7 states the number of false statements is a composite number. \n\nGiven that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself, and a composite number is a number with at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself, we can analyze the possibilities. \n\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 (since there are 7 statements) are 2, 3, 5, and 7. \n\nFor Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements (which is 7 minus the number of true statements) must be a composite number. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4, 6.\n\nLet's examine the possibilities based on Statement 6 and then check against Statement 7:\n\n1. If 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. 5 is not a composite number in the context required here, as it's not the number of false statements we're focusing on that's composite, but it fits the criteria for not being prime in the context of false statements being considered composite. However, 5 false statements do match the condition of being composite if considering its definition broadly. But this scenario doesn't satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4 directly.\n\n2. If 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. 4 is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7. This scenario aligns with Statement 4.\n\n3. If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. 2 is not a composite number, so this scenario does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\n4. If 7 statements are true, then 0 are false. 0 is not considered composite or prime in this context, so it doesn't fit Statement 7's condition directly.\n\nThe key statements to focus on are Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6, and Statement 7. Statement 3 and Statement 4 both suggest that exactly 4 statements are true (with Statement 4 implying this by stating exactly 3 are false), which would mean 3 statements are false. However, 3 is a prime number, not a composite number, which contradicts Statement 7 if we consider the number of false statements.\n\nStatement 5 is crucial because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. However, both lead to the conclusion that exactly 4 statements are true, which actually aligns with the conditions they set forth individually but does not directly resolve the potential contradiction with Statement 7 without considering the distribution of true and false statements more deeply.\n\nUpon deeper inspection, if exactly 4 statements are true, then 3 are false. This situation doesn't satisfy Statement 7 because 3 is prime, not composite. \n\nHowever, if we consider the scenario where exactly 3 statements are true (satisfying Statement 4 and the prime condition of Statement 6 indirectly because 3 is prime), then 4 statements are false, which satisfies Statement 7 because 4 is composite.\n\nThis means we have a potential solution where Statement 4 is true (exactly 3 statements are false, hence exactly 4 are true), Statement 6 is satisfied (the number of true statements, 3, is prime in the context of possible numbers of true statements), and Statement 7 is satisfied (the number of false statements, 4, is composite).\n\nGiven these conditions, Statement 5 can be satisfied by choosing Statement 4 to be true. Statement 1 is automatically satisfied since at least one statement is true. Statement 2 is also satisfied because at most 5 statements can be false (in this case, exactly 4 are false, which is within the limit). \n\nConsidering all interactions and the conditions provided, there are limited configurations that satisfy all given statements simultaneously. The conditions essentially boil down to having exactly 4 statements true to fit most of the criteria, but this creates a contradiction with Statement 7 when considering the composite requirement for false statements. \n\nThe correct configuration that fits all possible conditions without contradiction appears when we have exactly 3 true statements and 4 false statements, satisfying the prime and composite conditions directly, along with the other statements' requirements when interpreted correctly.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 1 </answer>",

Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true in a way that violates Statement 5, but since they describe the same outcome, they can both be considered true in the context of satisfying the numerical conditions. Statement 6 is satisfied if there are 5 true statements (a prime number). Statement 7, aiming for a composite number of false statements, is not directly satisfied with exactly 2 false statements since 2 is prime, not composite. However, this analysis might have led to an oversight in interpreting Statement 7's requirement correctly in the context of possible solutions.\n\nThe conditions point towards having exactly 5 true statements and exactly 2 false statements as a potential solution, given the constraints. This would make Statements 3 and 4 true, satisfying the \"at least\" and \"at most\" conditions of Statements 1 and 2, respectively. Statement 6 is also satisfied with 5 true statements. The critical aspect is ensuring all statements can logically coexist under these conditions.\n\nUpon reevaluation, considering the strict definitions and the aim for consistency across all statements:\n- For Statements 3 and 4 to be true (implying 5 true and 2 false), this directly satisfies the prime requirement of Statement 6 (since 5 is prime).\n- Statement 7's aim for a composite number of false statements seems initially at odds with having exactly 2 false statements, as 2 is not composite. Yet, this might be a point of contention based on the interpretation of \"composite\" in this logical context.\n\nHowever, let's correct the approach by directly evaluating the compatibility and implications of these statements under logical rules and the specific definitions of prime and composite numbers.\n\nIf exactly 5 statements are true and 2 are false, Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 can be satisfied under this condition. Statement 5 is also satisfied because it allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, and they both describe the same outcome. The challenge lies in Statement 7, which requires the number of false statements to be composite. With exactly 2 false statements, this condition is technically not met since 2 is a prime number, not a composite one.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the solution hinges on satisfying all conditions simultaneously without contradiction. However, the interpretation of Statement 7 in relation to composite numbers might have introduced a complexity that does not align with the straightforward satisfaction of other statements under the condition of 5 true and 2 false statements.\n\nCorrecting the line of reasoning: The conditions collectively point towards a specific distribution of true and false statements that can satisfy all given statements without contradiction, focusing on the logical implications and mathematical definitions involved.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

Statement 1 implies that at least 6 statements are true, which means 1 or 0 statements can be false.\n2. Statement 2 implies that at most 1 statement is false, which aligns with Statement 1, suggesting 6 or 7 true statements.\n3. Statement 3 directly states that exactly 6 statements are true, which means 1 statement is false.\n4. Statement 4 states that exactly 5 statements are false, which means 2 statements are true. This directly contradicts the implications of Statements 1, 2, and 3.\n5. Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the contradiction between Statements 3 and 4, this statement helps to validate the exclusivity of these conditions.\n6. Statement 6 suggests the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers relevant here could be 2, 3, 5, or 7, given the total number of statements is 7.\n7. Statement 7 states the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers are those that have more than two factors, which could be 4 or 6 in this context, given that 0 and 1 are not considered composite.\n\nGiven these statements, let's evaluate the possibilities:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true (exactly 6 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false (because of Statement 5), and we have 1 false statement. This scenario aligns with Statements 1 and 2. The number of true statements (6) is not prime, which would make Statement 6 false. However, 1 false statement does not fit the description of being composite as per Statement 7, creating a contradiction.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true (exactly 5 false statements, meaning 2 true statements), it directly contradicts the conditions set by Statements 1, 2, and 3, making them false. This would mean 5 false statements and 2 true statements. The number of true statements (2) is prime, fitting Statement 6, but the number of false statements (5) is not composite, contradicting Statement 7.\n\nConsidering the constraints and looking for a scenario that satisfies all conditions without contradiction:\n\n- For Statement 6 to be true (the number of true statements is prime), and considering the total number of statements is 7, the possible prime numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite. Given 7 statements, if 2 are true, 5 are false (which is not composite); if 3 are true, 4 are false (which is composite); if 5 are true, 2 are false (which is not composite); if 7 are true, 0 are false (which does not fit as 0 is not considered composite).\n\nThe only scenario that fits all conditions without contradiction is having exactly 3 true statements and 4 false statements. This makes Statement 6 true because 3 is a prime number, and Statement 7 true because 4 is a composite number. However, this scenario does not directly align with the initial implications of Statements 1, 2, and 3, which suggest a higher number of true statements.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the initial analysis overlooked the direct implications of Statement 5 and the prime/composite requirements. The correct approach should reconcile all statements' truth values considering the prime and composite conditions and the exclusivity stated in Statement 5.\n\nGiven the constraints and re-evaluating the statements for consistency and the requirement for the number of true statements to be prime and the number of false statements to be composite, we find that:\n\n- Having exactly 3 true statements (which is prime) and 4 false statements (which is composite) could potentially satisfy Statements 6 and 7. However, this does not align with the conditions set by Statements 1, 2, and 3, which imply a majority of true statements.\n\nThe critical insight lies in recognizing the potential for Statements 1, 2, and 3 to be true, given their conditions, and how they interact with Statements 6 and 7. If exactly 6 statements are true (as per Statement 3), this would indeed satisfy the \"at least 6\" condition of Statement 1 and the \"at most 1 false\" condition of Statement 2. However, this leaves us with the challenge of reconciling the prime and composite conditions with the given statements' constraints.\n\nUpon further reflection, the solution hinges on identifying a configuration that satisfies all given constraints without contradiction, particularly focusing on the prime number of true statements and the composite number of false statements, alongside the specific claims of Statements 1 through 5.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

However, 3 false statements contradict Statement 7 because 3 is prime, not composite.\n\nThe only way to satisfy the conditions without contradiction, especially considering the prime and composite requirements, is to have a scenario where the statements about the number of true and false statements align with the definitions of prime and composite numbers and do not contradict each other directly.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we see that having exactly 4 true statements (as suggested by Statements 3 and 4) would indeed mean 3 false statements, which does not satisfy Statement 7 since 3 is prime, not composite. But, if we consider the possibility of satisfying the prime and composite conditions directly:\n\n- For the number of true statements to be prime and the number of false statements to be composite, one possible scenario is having 5 true statements (prime) and 2 false statements (composite). This scenario does not directly align with the initial implications of Statements 3 and 4 but satisfies the prime and composite conditions.\n\nBut, considering all statements and their implications:\n- Statement 2 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with Statement 7.\n- Statements 3 and 4 imply the same outcome but are restricted by Statement 5.\n- The conditions of prime and composite numbers (Statements 6 and 7) must be met.\n\nGiven the constraints and analyzing the statements for logical consistency and numerical satisfaction, we find that the statements create a complex web of conditions. The key is finding a set of true and false statements that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.\n\nUpon careful analysis, we realize that the statements are crafted in such a way that they seem to allow for multiple interpretations.

If all statements were true (as per Statement 2), then Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 6, and Statement 7 could potentially be true because they do not contradict each other directly in this scenario. However, Statement 5 would be false because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, yet in this scenario, both would be considered true under the assumption that all statements are true.

If either of these is true, then the other must also be true due to their identical implications, which contradicts Statement 5. However, considering the structure of the statements, if exactly 4 statements are true, Statement 5 must be false because it claims only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n\n3. For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n4.

This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 3 true) and makes Statement 2 false. The number of false statements (3) is not composite, so Statement 7 would be false. The number of true statements (4) is not prime, so Statement 6 would also be false. Statement 5 would be false because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 would be considered true under this condition.

With 5 true statements, Statement 1, Statement 6 would be true. Statement 3 and Statement 4 would be false because they specify exactly 4 true statements.

Statement 5 would be false because it implies either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, yet in this scenario, both would be false.\n\nGiven these constraints and analyzing the statements, the only scenario that seems plausible without direct contradiction (considering the need for a prime number of true statements and the constraints provided) involves having exactly 5 true statements. However, this creates a contradiction with Statement 7 (since 2 false statements is not composite). Thus, we must carefully consider which statements can be true together without violating their conditions.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the conditions provided by the statements, especially with the requirements for prime and composite numbers, and the constraints on the number of true and false statements, lead to a complex web of possibilities. However, the key lies in identifying which statements can coexist truthfully.\n\nGiven the complexity and the constraints, let's reconsider the prime requirement and the composite requirement together: For the number of true statements to be prime and the number of false statements to be composite, and considering Statement 1 (at least 3 true), we have limited configurations that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.\n\nThe only configuration that could potentially satisfy the prime and composite conditions together, along with the other statements, is having exactly 5 true statements (a prime number) and 2 false statements (not composite, which poses a problem). This indicates a misunderstanding in the initial analysis regarding the satisfaction of both prime and composite conditions simultaneously with the other constraints.\n\nReevaluating, if we have exactly 3 true statements (to satisfy the prime condition with the number of true statements being 3, which is prime), this would mean 4 false statements, which is composite, satisfying Statement 7. However, this scenario does not align with the initial analysis aiming for 5 true statements to satisfy the prime condition, indicating a need to correct the approach based on the prime and composite requirements directly.\n\nCorrecting the approach: Considering the need for the number of true statements to be prime and the number of false statements to be composite, and given the statements' constraints:\n\n- For 3 true statements (prime), we have 4 false statements (composite), which could satisfy Statements 1, 6, and 7, but we need to check the other statements for consistency.\n\nGiven the complexity of directly solving this with the given constraints and the potential for oversight in the analysis, let's focus on the critical insight that the number of true statements must be prime and the number of false statements must be composite, with at least 3 statements being true.\n\nUpon further reflection, the direct analysis of each statement's truthfulness based on the given conditions and the constraints they impose on each other and the total number of statements reveals that finding a consistent set of true statements that satisfies all given conditions without contradiction is challenging due to the interdependencies and constraints provided.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of possible solutions given the truthfulness of these statements, not the solutions themselves.

      "full_model_response": "<think> \nFirst, we analyze the statements for any direct implications or contradictions. Statement 4 claims that exactly 6 of the statements are false, which means only 1 statement is true. If Statement 4 is true, then it must be the only true statement, making all other statements, including Statement 3, false. Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which immediately suggests that only one of these scenarios can occur, potentially limiting our solutions.\n\nStatement 1 says at least 4 statements are true, and Statement 2 says at most 2 statements are false, which essentially convey the same information since if at least 4 are true, then at most 3 can be false, but Statement 2 limits the false statements to 2 or fewer, implying at least 5 statements are true.\n\nStatement 3 claims exactly 5 statements are true, which aligns with the implication of Statement 1 and the constraint of Statement 2. If exactly 5 are true, then exactly 2 are false, satisfying both Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Given Statement 3's claim of exactly 5 true statements, this would be a prime number, potentially satisfying Statement 6.\n\nStatement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. If exactly 5 statements are true (as per Statement 3), then exactly 2 statements are false, which is a prime number, not a composite number, suggesting a potential issue with satisfying both Statements 6 and 7 simultaneously under the conditions given.\n\nConsidering Statement 5, if Statement 3 is true (exactly 5 statements are true), then Statement 4 must be false (since exactly 6 being false contradicts the premise of exactly 5 being true). This means we are looking for scenarios where exactly 5 statements can be true without violating the conditions set by other statements.\n\nFor exactly 5 statements to be true and satisfy the conditions of Statements 1, 2, 3, and 6, we consider which statements must be false. Since Statement 3 being true satisfies the conditions for Statements 1 and 2, and also aligns with a prime number of true statements (Statement 6), we have to reconcile this with Statement 7, which seems problematic since 2 false statements are not composite.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, Statement 7's requirement for the number of false statements to be composite cannot be satisfied if we adhere strictly to the prime number of true statements as per Statement 6 and the exact numbers stated in Statements 3 and 4. The only composite number of false statements less than 7 is 4 or 6, which would mean 3 or 1 true statements, respectively, neither of which satisfies the condition of having a prime number of true statements as per Statement 6, given the constraints of the other statements.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's evaluate the potential for solutions:\n\n1. Statement 3 being true allows for exactly 5 true statements, satisfying Statements 1 and 2. However, this creates tension with Statement 7, as 2 false statements are not composite.\n2. Statement 4, claiming exactly 6 false statements, cannot be true alongside any other statement being true, as it asserts only 1 statement (itself) can be true.\n\nThus, considering the compatibility of these statements under the constraints provided, we must find a combination that maximizes the truthfulness of statements without violating their conditions.\n\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statements 1 and 2 are automatically satisfied. Statement 5 is also satisfied because Statement 4 must be false. Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is indeed a prime number. However, Statement 7 poses a problem because 2 (the number of false statements if 5 are true) is not a composite number.\n\nGiven the logic puzzle nature of this problem and the specific constraints, let's assess the feasibility of each statement being true or false to maximize the number of true statements without contradiction.\n\nFor Statement 3 to be true, and given Statement 5's condition that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, Statement 4 must be one of the false statements. If we try to satisfy Statement 7 by having a composite number of false statements, we're constrained by the definitions of prime and composite numbers and the total number of statements.\n\nThe statements create a complex web of conditions that seem to constrain the solution space significantly. Given the requirement for a prime number of true statements and the specific claims of Statements 3 and 4, alongside the conditional Statement 5, the puzzle seems to hinge on satisfying these numerical conditions without violating the logical constraints posed by all statements.\n\nUpon deeper reflection, given that Statement 3 (exactly 5 true) is the most promising avenue for satisfying multiple conditions simultaneously (including Statements 1, 2, and 6), and acknowledging the issue with Statement 7 (2 false statements not being composite), the puzzle's constraints suggest a narrow path for valid solutions.\n\nHowever, it's critical to note the statements' implications on each other's truth values and the overall count of true and false statements. The conditions imposed by Statements 1 through 7, especially the numerical claims and the conditional statement (Statement 5), restrict the possible combinations of true and false statements significantly.\n\nGiven the constraints and analyzing the statements' implications, it appears challenging to satisfy all conditions without contradiction, particularly reconciling the prime number of true statements with the composite number of false statements as per Statements 6 and 7, respectively.\n\nTherefore, considering the logical constraints and the specific numerical conditions imposed by the statements, we evaluate the feasibility of satisfying these conditions to determine the number of possible solutions.\n</think>\n<answer> 0 </answer>",
