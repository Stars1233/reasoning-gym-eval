      "question": "A::B is a system with 4 tokens: `A#`, `#A`, `B#` and `#B`.\n\nAn A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:\n\n    B# A# #B #A B#\n\nTo *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:\n\n    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing\n    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#\n    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#\n    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing\n\nIn other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,\nthey must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule. For example, the\nfirst example shown here is computed as:\n\n    B# A# #B #A B# =\n    B# #B A# #A B# =\n    A# #A B# =\n    B#\n\nThe steps were:\n1. We replaced `A# #B` by `#B A#`.\n2. We replaced `B# #B` by nothing.\n3. We replaced `A# #A` by nothing.\nThe final result was just `B#`.\n\nNow, consider the following program:\n\nB# A# #A #A #B A# #B #A #A #B\n\nReturn the final state of the program.\n",
