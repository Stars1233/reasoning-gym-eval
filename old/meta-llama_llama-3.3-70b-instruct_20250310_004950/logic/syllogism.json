(This implies that every insect is a musician, but it does not restrict musicians to only insects; there could be other musicians as well.)\n2. No musicians are cats. (This means that the category of musicians and the category of cats are mutually exclusive.)\n\nGiven these two premises, we can conclude that since all insects are musicians and no musicians are cats, it logically follows that no insects are cats. This is because insects, being musicians, fall into a category that does not include cats.\n\n<answer>Yes</answer>",

Since all grandparents are artists, and there are artists who are not scientists, it is possible for some grandparents to be part of this subset of artists who are not scientists.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it logically follows that some grandparents could indeed not be scientists, because they are artists and there are artists who are not scientists.\n\n<answer>Yes</answer>",

No birds are students.\n\nThe first statement tells us that elephants and birds are distinct categories with no overlap. The second statement tells us that birds and students are also distinct categories with no overlap, but it doesn't directly relate birds to elephants.\n\nHowever, if we consider the first statement, \"No elephants are birds,\" it implies that being an elephant excludes being a bird. But it does not directly address the question of whether being a bird excludes being an elephant.\n\nLogically, if no elephants are birds, it does not necessarily mean that no birds can be elephants because the original statement only specifies that elephants cannot be birds, not that birds cannot be elephants. However, given the common understanding of these categories (elephants being large land mammals and birds being a class of warm-blooded vertebrates), it is intuitively true that no birds are elephants. But based strictly on the logical structure of the statements provided:\n\nThe correct logical interpretation is that the conclusion \"No birds are elephants\" is not directly supported by the given premises in a strict logical sense because the premises do not explicitly state that birds cannot be elephants; they only state that elephants cannot be birds and that birds are not students.\n\n<answer>Yes</answer>",

All whales are artists: This statement implies that every whale is an artist, establishing a subset relationship where whales are a subset of artists.\n2. Some artists are students: This statement indicates that there is an overlap between the set of artists and the set of students, but it does not specify how many artists are students, just that there is at least one.\n\nGiven these statements, if all whales are artists and some of those artists are students, then it is possible for some whales to be among the artists who are students. However, the statements do not guarantee that any whale is a student; they only establish a possibility.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it does not necessarily logically follow that some whales are students, but the possibility exists. The question asks for a logical conclusion, and the information given does not definitively support the conclusion that some whales are students. Thus, the answer to whether it logically follows that some whales are students is no, because we cannot conclude it with certainty from the given premises.\n\n<answer>No</answer>",
