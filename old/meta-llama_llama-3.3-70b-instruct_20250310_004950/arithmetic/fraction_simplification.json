This is the largest number that divides both 17850 and 30695 without leaving a remainder.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the GCD of 17850 and 30695.\nTo find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm or factorization. However, given the size of the numbers, the Euclidean algorithm is more efficient. We start by dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then continue with the remainder until we reach a remainder of 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm.\nStarting with the larger number, 30695, and the smaller number, 17850, we perform the division: $30695 = 1 \\times 17850 + 12845$. Next, we divide 17850 by 12845: $17850 = 1 \\times 12845 + 5005$. Continuing, $12845 = 2 \\times 5005 + 2835$. Then, $5005 = 1 \\times 2835 + 2170$. Next, $2835 = 1 \\times 2170 + 665$. Continuing, $2170 = 3 \\times 665 + 175$. Then, $665 = 3 \\times 175 + 140$. Next, $175 = 1 \\times 140 + 35$. Then, $140 = 4 \\times 35 + 0$. The last non-zero remainder is 35, which is the GCD of 17850 and 30695.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the fraction using the GCD.\nTo simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD found in step 3.

Starting with the Euclidean algorithm: 28652 = 3344 * 8 + 2800, 3344 = 2800 * 1 + 544, 2800 = 544 * 5 + 40, 544 = 40 * 13 + 24, 40 = 24 * 1 + 16, 24 = 16 * 1 + 8, 16 = 8 * 2 + 0. The last non-zero remainder is 8, so the GCD of 3344 and 28652 is 8.\n\n## Step 3: Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction.\nNow that we know the GCD is 8, we divide both 3344 and 28652 by 8 to simplify the fraction.

Using the Euclidean algorithm again: 3582 = 418 * 8 + 346, 418 = 346 * 1 + 72, 346 = 72 * 4 + 58, 72 = 58 * 1 + 14, 58 = 14 * 4 + 2, 14 = 2 * 7 + 0. The last non-zero remainder is 2, so the GCD of 418 and 3582 is 2.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction further if possible.\nSince the GCD of 418 and 3582 is 2, we can simplify the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2. Further simplified numerator = 418 / 2 = 209, Further simplified denominator = 3582 / 2 = 1791.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{209/1791}$",

This is because the GCD will be used to divide both the numerator and denominator to simplify the fraction.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the GCD of 13464 and 36504\nWe can calculate the GCD using various methods such as prime factorization, Euclidean algorithm, or finding common factors. For simplicity and efficiency, let's use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm\nStart with the larger number, 36504, as the dividend and the smaller number, 13464, as the divisor.

      "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator.\nTo simplify the fraction $4088/17920$, we first need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $4088$ and $17920$. This will help us reduce the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the prime factors of the numerator and the denominator.\nBreaking down $4088$ and $17920$ into their prime factors will aid in finding the GCD. The prime factorization of $4088$ is $2^4 \\times 7 \\times 73$ and the prime factorization of $17920$ is $2^7 \\times 5 \\times 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the common prime factors and the lowest powers.\nThe common prime factors between $4088$ and $17920$ are $2$ and $7$. The lowest power of $2$ they share is $2^4$ (from $4088$), and they both contain $7$ to the power of $1$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the GCD.\nUsing the common prime factors and their lowest powers, the GCD is $2^4 \\times 7 = 16 \\times 7 = 112$.\n\n## Step 5: Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\nTo simplify the fraction, divide $4088$ by $112$ and $17920$ by $112$. This results in $4088 / 112 = 36.5$ and $17920 / 112 = 160$.\n\n## Step 6: Write the simplified fraction.\nHowever, since we are simplifying a fraction, the result should be expressed as a fraction, not decimals. Therefore, the simplified form after dividing by the GCD is $36.5/160$. But to keep it as a fraction without decimals, we find that $4088/112 = 256/8 = 32$ for the numerator part and $17920/112 = 160$ for the denominator part, indicating a simplification mistake in step 5. Correcting this, we simplify $4088/17920$ by dividing both by their GCD, $112$, which actually results in $4088/112 = 36.5$ being incorrect for fraction simplification. The accurate simplification after finding the GCD should directly reduce the fraction: $4088/17920$ simplifies to $(2^4 \\times 7 \\times 73)/(2^7 \\times 5 \\times 7)$, cancelling out the common $2^4$ and $7$, yielding $73/(2^3 \\times 5)$.\n\n## Step 7: Final simplification.\nThe correct simplification of $4088/17920$ after removing the common factors is $73/(2^3 \\times 5) = 73/40$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{73/40}$",

This will help us reduce the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the GCD\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm or factorization to find the GCD. Let's start by finding the prime factors of both numbers. The prime factorization of 2508 is 2^3 * 3^2 * 13 * 2 and of 8772 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the common factors\nFrom the prime factorizations, we can see that both numbers share 2^2 and 3^2 as common factors.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the GCD\nThe GCD is the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power they appear in either factorization. So, GCD = 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction\nTo simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD. Simplified fraction = (2508 / 36) / (8772 / 36).\n\n## Step 6: Perform the division\nSimplified numerator = 2508 / 36 = 69.666... Simplified denominator = 8772 / 36 = 243.666... Since we are simplifying to lowest terms, we look for any remaining common factors after this division.\n\n## Step 7: Final simplification check\nUpon closer inspection, we notice that both the numerator and denominator can be divided by 12 (since 69.666... = 69 2/3 and 243.666... = 243 2/3, indicating both can be simplified further by 3, but we actually divide by 12 to simplify correctly to 69 2/3 / 243 2/3, which simplifies to 4/12 * 3/3 * 3/3 * 3 = 4/12 * 3 = 1/3 * 4 = 4/3 for the 3/3 * 3/3 * 3 part and then 2/2 for the remaining part, but correctly it simplifies by finding the actual GCD and dividing both numerator and denominator by it without converting to mixed numbers prematurely).\n\n## Step 8: Correct simplification\nThe correct approach to simplify is to divide both 2508 and 8772 by their greatest common divisor, which we found to be 36. So, 2508 / 36 = 69.666... and 8772 / 36 = 243.666..., but correctly, we should simplify the fraction 2508/8772 by dividing both by 36 to get 69.666.../243.666..., which actually simplifies directly to 2508/8772 = (2^3 * 3^2 * 13 * 2) / (2^2 * 3^2 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3) = (2 * 13 * 2) / (3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3) = 4 * 13 / 3^5 = 52 / 243.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{52}{243}}$",

The steps involve repeatedly applying the division algorithm, swapping the remainder with the divisor, until the remainder is 0.

      "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator to simplify the fraction.\nTo simplify the fraction $\\frac{11136}{11968}$, we first need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 11136 and 11968. This will help us reduce the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the GCD of 11136 and 11968.\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm or factorization to find the GCD. Let's start by finding the prime factors of both numbers to identify common factors.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 11136 and 11968 into their prime factors.\nFactorizing 11136 gives $2^6 \\times 3^2 \\times 23$ and factorizing 11968 gives $2^6 \\times 13 \\times 23$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the common prime factors and calculate the GCD.\nThe common prime factors are $2^6$ and $23$. Thus, the GCD is $2^6 \\times 23 = 1472$.\n\n## Step 5: Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction.\nDivide 11136 by 1472 to get $\\frac{11136}{1472} = 7.56$ and divide 11968 by 1472 to get $\\frac{11968}{1472} = 8.13$. However, since we are simplifying a fraction, we should express these as simplified fractions: $\\frac{11136}{1472} = \\frac{11136 \\div 1472}{1472 \\div 1472} = \\frac{7.56}{1}$ is incorrect for fraction simplification. Correctly, we simplify by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD: $\\frac{11136 \\div 1472}{11968 \\div 1472}$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the division to simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{11136 \\div 1472}{11968 \\div 1472} = \\frac{7.56}{8.13}$ is still incorrect because we need to simplify using the factors directly: $\\frac{2^6 \\times 3^2 \\times 23}{2^6 \\times 13 \\times 23}$. Cancel out the common factors: $\\frac{3^2}{13}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{13}}$",

Since both 187 and 140 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction 187/140 is already in its simplest form.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{187}{140}}$",
