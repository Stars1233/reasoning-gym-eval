To find the GCD of 732 and 781, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating the GCD of two numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Euclidean algorithm\nThe Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller number and then replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division. We repeat this process until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the Euclidean algorithm with the given numbers\nStart with the two numbers: 732 and 781. Since 781 is larger than 732, we divide 781 by 732 to get a quotient and a remainder.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the first step of the Euclidean algorithm\n781 divided by 732 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 49 (781 - 732 = 49).\n\n## Step 5: Continue the Euclidean algorithm with the previous divisor and remainder\nNow, we divide 732 by 49. This gives a quotient of 14 and a remainder of 38 (732 - 14*49 = 38).\n\n## Step 6: Continue the algorithm with the previous divisor and remainder\nNext, divide 49 by 38. This gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 11 (49 - 38 = 11).\n\n## Step 7: Continue the algorithm with the previous divisor and remainder\nNow, divide 38 by 11. This gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 5 (38 - 3*11 = 5).\n\n## Step 8: Continue the algorithm with the previous divisor and remainder\nNext, divide 11 by 5. This gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1 (11 - 2*5 = 1).\n\n## Step 9: Continue the algorithm with the previous divisor and remainder\nNow, divide 5 by 1. This gives a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 0 (5 - 5*1 = 0).\n\n## Step 10: Identify the GCD\nSince the last non-zero remainder before the remainder becomes 0 is 1, the GCD of 732 and 781 is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1</answer>",

Both numbers are even, so we start by dividing them by 2.\n\n584 divided by 2 is 292.\n536 divided by 2 is 268.\n\nWe continue this process:\n\n292 divided by 2 is 146.\n268 divided by 2 is 134.\n\n146 divided by 2 is 73.\n134 divided by 2 is 67.\n\nNow, 73 and 67 are both prime numbers and do not share common factors other than 1. So, we look back at our steps to find the greatest common factor before we reached prime numbers.\n\nThe last common factor we found was when we divided by 2 twice (or 4). \n\n584 divided by 4 is 146.\n536 divided by 4 is 134.\n\nHowever, we should continue factoring until we can't find common factors:\n\n146 = 2 * 73\n134 = 2 * 67\n\nBoth 73 and 67 are prime and distinct, so our common factor stops at 2 * 2 (or 4) since both original numbers were divisible by 4 but not by any higher power of 2 or any other common prime factor.\n\nThus, the greatest common divisor (GCD) is 4 * some other factors if any. Checking back, 584 = 2^3 * 73 and 536 = 2^3 * 67, meaning both share 2^3 (or 8) as the greatest common factor.\n\n<answer>8</answer>",
