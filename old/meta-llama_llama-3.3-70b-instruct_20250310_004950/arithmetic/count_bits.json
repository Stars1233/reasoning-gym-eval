Instead, we recognize that the number of 1 bits in a binary representation can be found by using bitwise operations or by converting the number to binary and then counting the 1s.\n\n## Step 4: Utilize bitwise operations for efficiency\nA more efficient approach involves using the built-in functions of programming languages to convert the number to binary and then count the 1s. However, since we're reasoning step-by-step without specific programming, we acknowledge that direct conversion and counting would be the straightforward, albeit laborious, method.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the properties of binary numbers\nRecognizing patterns or properties of binary numbers that have a lot of 1s (like numbers one less than a power of 2, which have all 1s in their binary representation) is not directly applicable here since 313435549 does not fit such a pattern.\n\n## Step 6: Apply conversion and counting\nGiven the constraints of this format, let's simplify: The actual process of converting 313435549 to binary and counting the 1s would typically involve computational tools for efficiency. The binary representation of 313435549 is 1001011011001001101001110011. Counting the 1s in this representation gives us the total number of 1 bits.\n\n## Step 7: Count the 1 bits\nCounting the 1s in 1001011011001001101001110011, we find: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
