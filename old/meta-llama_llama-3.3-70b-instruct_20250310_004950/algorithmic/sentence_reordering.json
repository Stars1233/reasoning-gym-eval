      "full_model_response": "To restore the correct order of words in the sentence 'every one exclaims present', we need to rearrange the words to form a grammatically correct and meaningful sentence. \n\n1. Identify the key elements: The sentence contains a subject (one), a verb (exclaims), and an object or phrase that the verb is acting upon (every present).\n2. Determine the correct order: Typically, in English, the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object or phrase the verb acts upon.\n3. Analyze the given words: 'every one' could imply 'everyone', 'every one' as in each individual, or it could be 'every' describing 'one'. 'exclaims' is a verb indicating an action of saying something loudly. 'present' could be a noun referring to a gift or an adjective meaning something is currently happening.\n4. Considering the most logical and grammatically correct arrangement, 'every one exclaims' suggests that each individual is exclaiming. The word 'present' seems to be the object of their exclamation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most logical rearrangement to form a coherent sentence would be: \"Every one exclaims, 'Present!'\"\n\nHowever, if we strictly interpret the task as simply rearranging the words without adding punctuation or assuming words not given, a logical and grammatically correct sentence could be formed by considering 'every one' as 'everyone' and making 'present' the object of the exclamation in a different context: \"Everyone exclaims present.\"\n\nThus, the corrected sentence, following typical English grammar rules without adding or assuming words, would most logically be interpreted as: \n\n<answer>Everyone exclaims present</answer>",
