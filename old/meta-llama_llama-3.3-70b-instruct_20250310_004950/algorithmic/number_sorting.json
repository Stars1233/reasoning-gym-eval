The order is as follows: 80.0, 68.9, 27.9, 10.3, 5.7, -11.2, -32.2, -42.5, -85.6\n\n## Step 3: Convert the sorted numbers into a list of strings.\nWe need to convert each number into a string and put them in a list. So, the sorted numbers in descending order as a list of strings are: ['80.0', '68.9', '27.9', '10.3', '5.7', '-11.2', '-32.2', '-42.5', '-85.6']\n\nThe final answer is: \n['80.0', '68.9', '27.9', '10.3', '5.7', '-11.2', '-32.2', '-42.5', '-85.6']",
