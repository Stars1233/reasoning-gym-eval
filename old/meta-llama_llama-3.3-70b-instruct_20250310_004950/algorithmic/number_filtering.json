Keep the numbers that are larger than -52.89.\n\nLet's do this with the given list: ['94.74', '80', '5', '70.496', '-73', '37.6622', '-65.336', '-35.264', '-72.1']\n\n- '94.74' as a float is 94.74, which is larger than -52.89. Keep.\n- '80' as a float is 80.0, which is larger than -52.89. Keep.\n- '5' as a float is 5.0, which is larger than -52.89. Keep.\n- '70.496' as a float is 70.496, which is larger than -52.89. Keep.\n- '-73' as a float is -73.0, which is not larger than -52.89. Discard.\n- '37.6622' as a float is 37.6622, which is larger than -52.89. Keep.\n- '-65.336' as a float is -65.336, which is not larger than -52.89. Discard.\n- '-35.264' as a float is -35.264, which is larger than -52.89. Keep.\n- '-72.1' as a float is -72.1, which is not larger than -52.89. Discard.\n\nSo, the new list with only the numbers larger than -52.89 is: ['94.74', '80', '5', '70.496', '37.6622', '-35.264']\n\n<answer>['94.74', '80', '5', '70.496', '37.6622', '-35.264']</answer>",
