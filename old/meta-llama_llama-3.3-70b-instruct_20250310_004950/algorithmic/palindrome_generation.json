Given all letters appear in pairs, this is straightforward. We can place any one pair of letters in the middle or use single letters if there were any without pairs, but in this case, all letters are in pairs, which simplifies our task.\n\nSo, the palindrome can be formed by placing one of each pair of letters on one side and then mirroring them on the other side. \n\nHere's one possible arrangement:\n\nhexufuffuxe-h is incorrect because it uses a hyphen, which isn't allowed.\n\nA correct approach would be to consider the sequence without worrying about the middle element first since we don't actually have a middle element that isn't paired:\n\ne-x-u-h-f on one side (using each pair once), then the reverse:\n\ne-x-u-h-f spells out the same forwards and backwards when completed:\n\ne-x-u-h-f-f-h-u-x-e\n\nSo, the palindrome using all the letters provided, without spaces or punctuation, and reading the same forwards and backwards, is:\n\n<answer>exuhffuhxe</answer>",
