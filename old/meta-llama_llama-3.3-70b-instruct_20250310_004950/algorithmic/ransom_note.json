This can be done using Python's built-in dictionary data type.\n\n2. **Compare frequencies**: Iterate through the ransom note's frequency dictionary. For each character, check if the magazine's frequency dictionary has at least as many occurrences of that character as the ransom note does. If at any point the magazine doesn't have enough of a character, immediately return False.\n\n3. **Return True if all characters can be covered**: If the function iterates through all characters in the ransom note without returning False, it means the magazine has enough of each character to construct the ransom note, so return True.\n\nHere's a Python implementation based on this logic:\n\n```python\ndef canConstruct(ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:\n    # Create frequency dictionaries\n    ransom_freq = {}\n    magazine_freq = {}\n    \n    for char in ransomNote:\n        if char in ransom_freq:\n            ransom_freq[char] += 1\n        else:\n            ransom_freq[char] = 1\n            \n    for char in magazine:\n        if char in magazine_freq:\n            magazine_freq[char] += 1\n        else:\n            magazine_freq[char] = 1\n    \n    # Compare frequencies\n    for char, freq in ransom_freq.items():\n        if char not in magazine_freq or magazine_freq[char] < freq:\n            return False\n            \n    return True\n\nransomNote = \"dbihhqbs\"\nmagazine = \"hqeblhwibdsdbscjomvhok\"\nprint(canConstruct(ransomNote, magazine))\n```\n\n<answer>False</answer>",
