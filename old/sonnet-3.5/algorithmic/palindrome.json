First, I need to count the frequency of each letter:\n   - c appears 2 times\n   - s appears 2 times\n   - w appears 2 times\n   - d appears 2 times\n   - x appears 2 times\n\n2. Since each letter appears exactly twice, this means we can form a perfect palindrome.\n\n3. To form a palindrome:\n   - I can place one instance of each letter in the first half\n   - And mirror them in the second half in reverse order\n\n4. Let me arrange them:\n   - First half: c s w d x\n   - Second half (mirror): x d w s c\n\n5. Combining them: c s w d x x d w s c\n</think>\n<answer>cswdxxdwsc</answer>",
