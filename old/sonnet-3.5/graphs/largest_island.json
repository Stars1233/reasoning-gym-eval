      "full_model_response": "<think>\nLet me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, I need to identify all islands in the grid. An island is a group of connected 1's.\n\n2) I need to count the number of 1's in each island.\n\n3) Looking at the grid, I can see several distinct islands:\n   - First island in top-right: 3 cells (connected 1's)\n   - Second island in left-middle: 7 cells (forms an L shape)\n   - Third island in middle: 4 cells (diagonal pattern)\n   - Fourth island at bottom-left: 3 cells\n\n4) Let me count each island's area:\n   - Top-right island: 3 cells\n   - Left-middle island (the largest): 7 cells\n   - Middle island: 4 cells\n   - Bottom-left island: 3 cells\n\n5) The maximum area among these islands is 7, which corresponds to the L-shaped island in the left-middle portion of the grid.\n</think>\n<answer>7</answer>",
