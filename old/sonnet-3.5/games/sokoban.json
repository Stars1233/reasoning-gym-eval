We have multiple boxes (one $ on a goal)\n3. We have multiple goals (X)\n4. We need to move the box that's already on a goal and potentially get other boxes to goals\n\nLooking at the structure:\n- One box is already on a goal ($)\n- There are 4 goals (X)\n- There appears to be one original player position (*)\n- The other @ symbols must be walls or empty spaces (likely a typo)\n\nThis puzzle seems improperly formatted with multiple player positions, which isn't possible in a standard Sokoban puzzle. The puzzle cannot be solved as presented because:\n1. Multiple player positions are invalid\n2. There's only one visible box but multiple goals\n3. The presence of @ symbols in multiple positions makes the puzzle ambiguous\n\n</think>\n<answer>This puzzle appears to be invalid due to multiple player positions and unclear elements.
