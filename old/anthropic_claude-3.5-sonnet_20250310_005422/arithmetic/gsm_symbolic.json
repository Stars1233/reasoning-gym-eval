First, let's identify the key information:\n   * Comet Encke appears every 55 years\n   * Uncle saw it at age 24\n   * Michael saw it a second time when he was 4 \u00d7 24 = 96 years old\n\n2. Since Michael saw it a second time, that means:\n   * He must have seen it once before\n   * The time between his first and second sighting must be 55 years\n\n3. To find Michael's age at first sighting:\n   * His age at second sighting: 96 years\n   * Time between sightings: 55 years\n   * Therefore, his age at first sighting: 96 - 55 = 41\n\n<answer>41</answer>",
