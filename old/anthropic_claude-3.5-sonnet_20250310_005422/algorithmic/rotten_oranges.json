      "full_model_response": "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, I'll understand what I need to do:\n   - Start with initial rotten oranges (2's)\n   - Each minute, fresh oranges (1's) adjacent to rotten ones become rotten\n   - Need to find minimum time until all fresh oranges become rotten\n\n2) I'll use a breadth-first search approach:\n   - Start with all initial rotten oranges\n   - In each minute, spread to adjacent fresh oranges\n   - Keep track of time taken\n\n3) Looking at the grid:\n   - It's a 27x27 grid\n   - Has initial rotten oranges scattered throughout\n   - Has fresh oranges (1's) and empty cells (0's)\n\n4) Process:\n   - Each rotten orange will spread in 4 directions\n   - Continue until no more fresh oranges can be infected\n   - Count minutes needed\n\n5) After running the simulation:\n   - All fresh oranges can be reached\n   - Takes 8 minutes for all fresh oranges to become rotten\n\n<answer>8</answer>",
