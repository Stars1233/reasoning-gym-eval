For n=7 disks, we need 2^7 - 1 = 127 moves\n3. The solution follows a recursive pattern:\n   - Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary\n   - Move largest disk from source to destination\n   - Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination\n4. Let me work out all the moves following this pattern\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n</answer>",

To move n disks, I'll use the recursive algorithm:\n   - Move n-1 disks to auxiliary peg\n   - Move largest disk to destination\n   - Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination\n3. For 6 disks, this will take 2^6 - 1 = 63 moves\n4. Following the algorithm recursively for each subproblem...\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n</answer>",

      "full_model_response": "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, understand that for 7 disks, we need 2^7 - 1 = 127 moves.\n2. For odd number of disks, first move is from source to destination.\n3. Follow the pattern: source to destination, source to auxiliary, auxiliary to destination.\n4. Smaller disks move every other step.\n5. Larger disks move when necessary following valid moves.\n6.
