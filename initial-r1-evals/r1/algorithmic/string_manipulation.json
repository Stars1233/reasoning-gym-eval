      "question": "Your job is to repeatedly transform a string according to a set of rules until no further transformations can be performed, or a state is repeated.\n\nEvaluate the following rules in order, and apply the first applicable rule to the string:\n1. If the string contains an even number of 'b's (and at least one 'b'), append 'ab' at the end.\n2. If the string prefix is 'bc', delete the first two characters and append 'aa' to the end.\n3. If the string ends with 'ca', remove the last character.\n4. If the string suffix is 'ac', replace it with 'cb'.\n5. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n6. If the string contains 'ca' (not at the start), remove the first occurrence found after the first character.\n7. If the string suffix is 'bb', delete the last two characters.\n8. If the string starts with 'ac', replace the first two characters with 'zz'.\n\nOnce you have applied a rule, repeat the process with the new string until no further transformations can be performed (i.e. the string doesn't change), or a state is repeated.\nIf a state is repeated, the process is terminated, and the repeated state is discarded (i.e. is not considered as the final answer) and the state before the repeated state is considered as the final answer.\n\nExample:\n- Input:\n    - String: abbac\n    - Rules:\n        1. If the string prefix is 'ab', replace it with 'ca'.\n        2. If the string prefix is 'ca', replace it with 'bb' and append 'c' to the end.\n        3. If the string ends with 'aa', replace it with 'cc'.\n- Output: bbbacc\n- Explanation:\n    - In the first iteration, rule 1 is applied to the string abbac, resulting in cabac\n    - In the second interation, rule 1 doesn't apply, but rule 2 is applied to the string cabac, resulting in bbbacc\n    - In the third iteration, none of the rules (1, 2, 3) apply, so the process is terminated, and the final answer is bbbacc\n\nTransform the following string according to the above list of rules:\nacbaaaca\n",
