The conjugate of -7.0 - 5.0i is -7.0 + 5.0i. So, the division can be written as: ((-7.0 - 79.0i) * (-7.0 + 5.0i)) / ((-7.0 - 5.0i) * (-7.0 + 5.0i)). Now, we can calculate the numerator and the denominator separately. The numerator is (-7.0 * -7.0) + (-7.0 * 5.0i) + (-79.0i * -7.0) + (-79.0i * 5.0i), which equals 49.0 - 35.0i + 553.0i - 395.0i^2. Since i^2 equals -1, this simplifies to 49.0 - 35.0i + 553.0i + 395.0. The denominator is (-7.0 * -7.0) + (-7.0 * 5.0i) + (-5.0i * -7.0) + (-5.0i * 5.0i), which equals 49.0 - 35.0i + 35.0i - 25.0i^2. This simplifies to 49.0 + 25.0, which equals 74.0. Now we simplify the numerator: 49.0 + 395.0 - 35.0i + 553.0i, which equals 444.0 + 518.0i. So the division simplifies to (444.0 + 518.0i) / 74.0.
