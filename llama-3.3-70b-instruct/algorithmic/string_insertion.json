Start by checking the string for the substrings ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, and EABC.\n2. The first occurrence of a matching substring is DEAB at the end of the string (DEDECDAAB[CB]), but since we are looking for DEAB and it's not present as the string is DEDECDAABC[B], we continue.\n3. Upon closer inspection, we see that there's no direct match for any of the given substrings in the initial string without considering the newly inserted characters.\n4. However, we notice the substring CDEA is not directly present, but we do have a DE at the start, which could potentially be part of the pattern if we consider the wrap-around or additional characters.\n5. Checking again with a focus on potential matches:\n   - The substring DEAB is not found.\n   - The substring EABC is not found.\n   - The substring ABCD is not found.\n   - The substring BCDE is not found.\n   - The substring CDEA is not found directly, but we have CDAABCB which doesn't match any pattern directly.\n6.

Applying the rules strictly:\n   - No initial match for ABCD, BCDE, CDEA, DEAB, or EABC is found in the sequence provided.\n   - Given the rules, we should insert characters based on finding these exact sequences, and upon finding one, insert the specified character and skip over it and the inserted character.\n8. Since there are no direct matches initially, we must consider if any part of the string, when modified by insertion, could create a match. However, the rules specify insertion after a match, and we don't preemptively insert to create a match.\n9.

Since none of the substrings ABCD, BCDE, DEAB, and EABC are present in the string, we check for CDEA. The substring CDEA is not present, but we can find a possible match by rearranging the string according to the pattern rules. However, upon closer inspection, we see that there is no direct match for any of the patterns in the given string ECAAE. But, looking closely at the string, if we consider the substring EABC which is not present in the string but the substring EAA contains the character sequence EA, and we might consider ABC if it were present, however, the character sequence in the given string ECAAE doesn't directly offer a match to the patterns. Upon careful consideration, the substring CDEA can be considered if we find CDE followed by A, and indeed we find it: ECAAE can be split into EC (from the start) and then AAE. Focusing on the useful part AAE, which follows the first two characters, AAE can be considered as a substring where we can identify the sequence AA that immediately follows the first character in the sequence that would match the requirement if we were to look at the full sequence that would enable us to determine if CDEA could be used. Looking again carefully at ECAAE and considering if there is any scope of getting CDEA, indeed the presence of \"C\" followed by the sequence that includes \"DE\" and then an \"A\" isn't seen. Therefore, checking this more thoroughly: start with 'E', then 'C', then 'A', then 'A', and lastly 'E'. Now carefully looking into this: it can be determined that only the pattern EABC can be considered if we were to rearrange, however, that would need an 'A' after 'E' then 'A' then 'B' then 'C' - none of these requirements are met, hence none of these are applicable in this context directly for an insertion based on the description provided. But looking closely, it can indeed be observed that there isn't any \"B\", \"D\" that is following in the sequence hence these don't contribute towards the solution.
