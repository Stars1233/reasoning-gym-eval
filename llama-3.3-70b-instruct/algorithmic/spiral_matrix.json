We can achieve this by maintaining four pointers: top, bottom, left, and right, representing the current boundaries of the matrix. We start by initializing these pointers to the edges of the matrix. Then, we traverse the elements in a spiral order by moving right, down, left, and up, and append each element to the result list. After each traversal, we update the corresponding pointer to mark the traversed elements as visited. We continue this process until all elements are traversed.\n\nFirst, we move right from the top-left element to the top-right element, then move down from the top-right element to the bottom-right element, then move left from the bottom-right element to the bottom-left element, and finally move up from the bottom-left element to the top-left element.

After that, we move up until we reach the second row (i.e., one below the previously traversed row). We continue this process until we have traversed all elements in the matrix.\n\nWe can use four pointers to keep track of the current boundaries of the matrix: top, bottom, left, and right. Initially, top is 0, bottom is the number of rows minus 1, left is 0, and right is the number of columns minus 1.\n\nWe will use a while loop to continue the traversal until all elements have been visited. In each iteration, we first traverse from left to right, then from top to bottom, then from right to left, and finally from bottom to top. After each traversal, we update the corresponding boundary pointer.\n\nWe will store the traversed elements in a list and finally return this list as a space-separated string.\n</think>\n<answer>\n5 9 9 9 2 3 5 3 0 9 8 2 5 7 1 1 2 9 8 2 2 5 3 8 7 7 9 5 5 5 3 0 8 1 4 3 8 9 3 0 4 4 4 3 5 7 1 8 6 1 5 1 8 6 5 6 2 5 7 8 6 5 3 1 9 6 5 3 1 7 6 3 8 7 1 9 5 9 7 1 9 6 5 9 9 8 5 9 1 9 6 2 9 5 4 4 4 3 3 8 6 5 6 2 5 7 4 1 1 8 6 1 5 1 8\n</answer>",

We continue this process until we have traversed all elements in the matrix.\n\nWe can achieve this by using four pointers: top, bottom, left, and right, to keep track of the current boundaries of the matrix. We start by initializing these pointers to the edges of the matrix. Then, we traverse the elements in the matrix in a spiral order by moving the pointers accordingly.\n\nIn this case, the input matrix is:\n3 6 3 2 3 0 4 0 7\n5 4 0 8 1 4 4 9 0\n1 0 8 6 6 2 5 3 3\n2 3 4 5 9 8 9 8 6\n1 5 5 1 4 5 3 9 3\n1 6 2 4 7 0 2 8 6\n2 9 9 0 0 7 7 4 5\n6 6 5 9 2 1 5 0 2\n5 0 9 1 0 1 7 7 1\n\nWe initialize the pointers: top = 0, bottom = 8, left = 0, right = 8.\n\nThen, we start traversing the elements in the matrix in a spiral order. \n\nFirst, we move right: 3 6 3 2 3 0 4 0 7\nThen, we move down: 5 4 0 8 1 4 4 9 0, 1 0 8 6 6 2 5 3 3, 2 3 4 5 9 8 9 8 6, 1 5 5 1 4 5 3 9 3, 1 6 2 4 7 0 2 8 6, 2 9 9 0 0 7 7 4 5, 6 6 5 9 2 1 5 0 2, 5 0 9 1 0 1 7 7 1\nNext, we move left: 5 0 9 1 0 1 7 7 1, 6 6 5 9 2 1 5 0 2, 2 9 9 0 0 7 7 4 5, 1 6 2 4 7 0 2 8 6, 1 5 5 1 4 5 3 9 3, 2 3 4 5 9 8 9 8 6, 1 0 8 6 6 2 5 3 3, 5 4 0 8 1 4 4 9 0\nThen, we move up: 5 4 0 8 1 4 4 9 0, 1 0 8 6 6 2 5 3 3, 2 3 4 5 9 8 9 8 6, 1 5 5 1 4 5 3 9 3, 1 6 2 4 7 0 2 8 6, 2 9 9 0 0 7 7 4 5, 6 6 5 9 2 1 5 0 2, 5 0 9 1 0 1 7 7 1\nFinally, we move right: 3 6 3 2 3 0 4 0 7\n\nAfter traversing all elements, we get the list of elements in spiral order.\n</think>\n<answer> 3 6 3 2 3 0 4 0 7 0 9 4 4 1 8 0 4 6 3 3 5 9 8 6 2 5 3 3 4 5 9 8 9 8 6 1 5 5 1 4 5 3 9 3 1 6 2 4 7 0 2 8 6 2 9 9 0 0 7 7 4 5 6 6 5 9 2 1 5 0 2 5 0 9 1 0 1 7 7 1 </answer>",

We can achieve this by maintaining four pointers - top, bottom, left, and right - representing the current boundaries of the matrix. \n\nWe start by initializing these pointers to the edges of the matrix. Then, we traverse the elements from left to right along the top row, and move the top pointer down. Next, we traverse the elements from top to bottom along the right column, and move the right pointer left. We continue this process, alternating between moving right and down, then left and up, until all elements have been visited.\n\nThe spiral order traversal can be implemented using a loop that continues until all elements have been visited. Inside the loop, we first traverse from left to right, then from top to bottom, then from right to left, and finally from bottom to top. After each traversal, we update the corresponding pointer to mark the visited elements as 'visited' and to move the boundary of the matrix.\n\nWe append each visited element to the result list.

Then, we move down from the top-right element to the bottom-right element, adding each element to the result list and decrementing the bottom pointer. Next, we move left from the bottom-right element to the bottom-left element, adding each element to the result list and incrementing the left pointer. Finally, we move up from the bottom-left element to the top-left element, adding each element to the result list and incrementing the top pointer. \n\nWe repeat this process until all elements are visited, i.e., until the top pointer is greater than the bottom pointer or the left pointer is greater than the right pointer. \n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given matrix. </think>\n<answer> 9 2 1 7 0 5 3 2 4 9 1 8 3 6 1 0 5 4 2 0 0 4 8 6 0 9 9 4 9 1 8 8 6 0 1 7 9 1 4 1 1 8 5 6 1 1 3 5 7 2 8 7 9 1 0 9 9 8 1 6 9 1 1 6 3 2 7 2 8 0 2 8 4 0 2 3 5 9 2 5 2 </answer>",
