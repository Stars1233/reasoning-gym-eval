This algorithm involves repeatedly applying the division algorithm to find the remainder, and then using the divisor and remainder as the new dividend and divisor until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder will be the GCD. First, divide 908 by 650 to get a quotient and a remainder. 908 divided by 650 equals 1 remainder 258. Then, divide 650 by 258 to get a quotient and a remainder. 650 divided by 258 equals 2 remainder 134. Next, divide 258 by 134 to get a quotient and a remainder. 258 divided by 134 equals 1 remainder 124. Continue with 134 divided by 124, which equals 1 remainder 10. Then, 124 divided by 10 equals 12 remainder 4. Next, 10 divided by 4 equals 2 remainder 2. Finally, 4 divided by 2 equals 2 remainder 0.

The last non-zero remainder is the GCD. \nFirst, we divide 972 by 412, which gives us 2 with a remainder of 148. Then, we divide 412 by 148, which gives us 2 with a remainder of 116. Next, we divide 148 by 116, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 32. We continue by dividing 116 by 32, which gives us 3 with a remainder of 20. Then, we divide 32 by 20, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 12. Next, we divide 20 by 12, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 8. We continue by dividing 12 by 8, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 4. Then, we divide 8 by 4, which gives us 2 with a remainder of 0.

The algorithm involves repeatedly applying the formula gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b) until we reach a remainder of 0. The last non-zero remainder will be the GCD. First, we apply the formula with a = 584 and b = 536. We calculate the remainder of 584 divided by 536, which is 48. Then, we apply the formula again with a = 536 and b = 48, calculating the remainder of 536 divided by 48, which is 8. We continue this process until we reach a remainder of 0. Applying the formula with a = 48 and b = 8, we find that 48 divided by 8 equals 6 with a remainder of 0.
