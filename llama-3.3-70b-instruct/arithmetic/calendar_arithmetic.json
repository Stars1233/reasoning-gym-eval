Given that 2022 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. We know that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. We can count the days from January 1 to February 21, accounting for the days in January and the first 21 days of February to find out which day of the week it was. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31, it's 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days (since 31 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 3). This means January 31 was 3 days ahead of Saturday, which would be a Tuesday. Then, moving into February, we add the first 21 days. 21 days is 3 weeks, which brings us back to the same day of the week as January 31, and then we add the extra days from the remainder, but since 21 is exactly 3 weeks, it doesn't advance the day of the week further.

January 31, being 31 days after January 1, would indeed be a Monday (since 31 mod 7 = 3, and Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday, but considering the full month's passage and its effect on the weekly cycle, the correct approach involves understanding the pattern of the days).

Additionally, for the remaining days (August 29 to November 23), count the business days individually: August 29 (Monday) to August 31 is 3 business days, September 1 to September 30 is 22 business days (all September), October 1 to October 31 is 21 or 22 business days (since October 31 is a Monday, it counts as a business day), and November 1 to November 23 has 18 business days up to the Wednesday, November 23. However, a simpler approach might be to calculate the total days and then subtract the non-business days (weekends). From August 27 to November 23, there are 89 days total.

Calculate the total number of days from May 26, 2022, to September 2, 2022.\nMay has 31 days, so from May 26 to May 31, there are 6 days.\nJune has 30 days.\nJuly has 31 days.\nAugust has 31 days.\nFrom September 1 to September 2, there are 2 days.\nSo, total days = 6 (remaining in May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 2 (in September) = 100 days.\n\n2. Calculate the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period.\nSince the period starts on a Thursday and ends on a Friday, we need to consider the full weekends (both Saturday and Sunday) within the complete months of June, July, and August, and the partial months of May and September.\n- May 2022 has 1 full weekend (since it starts on a Thursday, the 26th, and includes the 28th and 29th).\n- June, July, and August each have 4 full weekends (since they start on a Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday respectively, but each month has 4 weekends).\n- September 2022 has 1 weekend (since it includes the 3rd and 4th).\n\nSo, total full weekends = 1 (in May) + 4 (in June) + 4 (in July) + 4 (in August) + 1 (in September) = 14 weekends.\nEach weekend has 2 days (Saturday and Sunday), so total weekend days = 14 weekends * 2 days/weekend = 28 days.\n\n3. Subtract the total weekend days from the total days to find the number of business days.\nTotal business days = Total days - Total weekend days = 100 days - 28 days = 72 days.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure we're counting the days correctly, especially considering the start and end dates. The calculation above assumes all days are counted correctly, but let's verify the weekends and the specific days of the week for the start and end dates.\n\nGiven that May 26, 2022, is a Thursday and September 2, 2022, is a Friday, and considering the correct count of weekends and days, the approach seems to be logically sound. But to ensure accuracy, let's break it down further:\n- May 26 to May 31 includes 3 business days (Thursday, Friday, Monday) since the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is counted as non-business days.\n- June, July, and August contribute (20 + 22 + 23) = 65 business days, since each month has approximately 4 weeks, and thus about 20-23 business days depending on how the weeks fall.\n- September 1 and 2 add 2 more business days.\n\nThus, recalculating or verifying with this breakdown:\n- May: 3 business days (26th, 27th, 30th, 31st) = 4 days (not 3, correcting the oversight).\n- June, July, August: Approximately 22 days/month * 3 months = 66 days, but accurately it's 22 (June) + 22 (July) + 23 (August) = 67 days.\n- September: 2 business days (1st, 2nd).\n\nSo, the correct total is 4 (May) + 67 (June, July, August) + 2 (September) = 73 business days.\n\n</think>\n<answer> 73 </answer>",
