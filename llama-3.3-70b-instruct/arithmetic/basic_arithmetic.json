When we subtract a negative number, it's the same as adding a positive number. So, - (-9292) is the same as +9292. Therefore, our expression becomes -65 + 9292 + 5869 - 6236. Now, let's calculate this step by step. First, we add -65 and 9292, which equals 9227. Then, we add 5869 to that result, giving us 9227 + 5869 = 15096.

After finding the quotient of the division, we will add 717, 766, and 315 to it. The calculation steps are as follows:\n1. Perform the division: 168 / 56 = 3\n2. Add the numbers: 3 + 717 + 766 + 315\n3. Continue adding: 3 + 717 = 720\n4. Then, 720 + 766 = 1486\n5. Finally, 1486 + 315 = 1801\nSo, the result of the given expression is 1801. </think>\n<answer> 1801 </answer>",
