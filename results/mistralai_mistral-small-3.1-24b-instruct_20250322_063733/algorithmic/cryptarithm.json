Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the problem:**\n   ```\n     QKKYK\n   + RRDWN\n   -------\n     WPRDD\n   ```\n\n2. **Determine the possible values for each letter:**\n   - Since no leading letter can be zero, Q, R, and W must be non-zero digits.\n   - The sum of two 5-digit numbers results in a 5-digit number, implying that there is no carry over from the leftmost column.\n\n3. **Analyze the units place:**\n   - K + N must equal D or D + 10 (if there is a carry).\n   - Since D is a single digit, K + N must be either D or D + 10.\n\n4. **Analyze the tens place:**\n   - Y + W must equal R or R + 10 (if there is a carry).\n   - Since R is a single digit, Y + W must be either R or R + 10.\n\n5. **Analyze the hundreds place:**\n   - K + D must equal P or P + 10 (if there is a carry).\n   - Since P is a single digit, K + D must be either P or P + 10.\n\n6. **Analyze the thousands place:**\n   - K + W must equal R or R + 10 (if there is a carry).\n   - Since R is a single digit, K + W must be either R or R + 10.\n\n7. **Analyze the ten-thousands place:**\n   - Q + R must equal W or W + 10 (if there is a carry).\n   - Since W is a single digit, Q + R must be either W or W + 10.\n\n8. **Solve for the digits:**\n   - By trial and error, we can find a combination that satisfies all the above conditions.\n   - Let's try Q=1, R=2, W=3, K=4, Y=5, D=6, N=7, P=8.\n\n9. **Verify the solution:**\n   -

Since D and K are distinct digits, we need to find a combination that satisfies this condition.\n\n- From the hundreds place, we know 0 + 0 = 0, which is trivially true.\n\n- From the thousands place, we know D = D, which is trivially true.\n\n- From the ten-thousands place, we know D = D, which is trivially true.\n\nLet's try some values:\n\n- Assume D = 1, then K must be a digit such that 1 + U = K (mod 10).
