Example:\n\n    B# A# #B #A B#\n\nTo *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:\n\n    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing\n    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#\n    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#\n    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing\n\nIn other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,\nthey must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.\n\nNow, consider the following program:\n\nB# A# #A #A #B A# #B #A #A #B\n\nReturn the final state of the program.\n",
