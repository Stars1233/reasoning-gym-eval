The key \"48wE8WK9\" translates to positions in the alphabet as follows: 4, 8, 22, 4, 8, 22, 10, 16, 9. These positions are used to shift the letters in the message backwards.\n\nBy carefully reversing the shifts for each letter in the message using the key, we can decrypt the message.\n\n<answer>{\"translated_message\": \"This is a secret message\"}</answer>",

To find the `max_proportion`, we need to consider the proportion of perfect partitions to total partitions up to the point where `m` is 2652.\n\nSince the output is `{'smallest_m': 2652}`, we can infer that the `max_proportion` must be a value that allows the proportion of perfect partitions to total partitions to be less than `max_proportion` when `m` is 2652.\n\nA feasible input that would result in this output could be a `max_proportion` that is slightly greater than the proportion of perfect partitions to total partitions when `m` is 2652. For example, if the proportion of perfect partitions to total partitions is approximately 0.000376 when `m` is 2652, a feasible input could be `max_proportion = 0.00038`.\n\n<answer>{\"max_proportion\": 0.00038}</answer>",

This involves rearranging the tree such that all nodes are connected through their right pointers in a single linked list.\n\n3. **Extract the Flattened List**: Traverse the linked list and collect the node values to form the final flattened list.\n\nLet's break down the input data and construct the binary tree step-by-step:\n\n- `root_data`: [100, 5, 63, 1, 67, 85, 41]\n- `left_data`: [None, None, 78, None, None, None, 78]\n- `right_data`: [None, 6, 20, None, 69, 2, None]\n\n### Step-by-Step Construction of the Binary Tree:\n\n1. **Root Node**: 100\n   - Left: None\n   - Right: None\n\n2. **Second Node**: 5\n   - Left: None\n   - Right: 6\n\n3. **Third Node**: 63\n   - Left: 78\n   - Right: 20\n\n4. **Fourth Node**: 1\n   - Left: None\n   - Right: None\n\n5. **Fifth Node**: 67\n   - Left: None\n   - Right: 69\n\n6. **Sixth Node**: 85\n   - Left: None\n   - Right: 2\n\n7. **Seventh Node**: 41\n   - Left: 78\n   - Right: None\n\n### Flattening the Binary Tree:\n\nTo flatten the binary tree, we need to rearrange the nodes such that all nodes are connected through their right pointers.

The maximum of these sums is the desired output.\n\nTo achieve the sum of 230, we need to consider large values of `a` and `b` because smaller values will not yield such a high sum of digits.
