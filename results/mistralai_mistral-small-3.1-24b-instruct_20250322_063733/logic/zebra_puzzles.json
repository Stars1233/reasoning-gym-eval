Since Arnold is in house 2 and likes Butterscotch, Carol must be in house 1 or 3. But since the coffee drinker is in house 3, Carol must be in house 1.\n10.

The Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the fourth house.\n2. The person who loves blue is Carol.\n3. The Desert smoothie lover is Arnold.\n4. The person who is the mother of Timothy is the person who loves blue.\n5. The person who loves brown is Bob.\n6. The Darkness smoothie drinker is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker.\n7. Alice and the person who loves purple are next to each other.\n8. Bob is the Darkness smoothie drinker.\n9. The person who loves brown is the person's child is named Alice.\n10. The person who is the mother of Billy is in the second house.\n\nFrom clue 2 and 4, we know that Carol is the mother of Timothy and loves blue. From clue 5 and 9, we know that Bob loves brown and his child is named Alice. From clue 8, we know that Bob is the Darkness smoothie drinker. From clue 3, we know that Arnold loves the Desert smoothie. From clue 1, we know that the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the fourth house.\n\nNow, let's use clue 6: The Darkness smoothie drinker (Bob) is directly left of the Butterscotch smoothie drinker. This means Bob is in House 2 and the Butterscotch smoothie drinker is in House 3.\n\nFrom clue 10, the mother of Billy is in the second house. Since Bob is in the second house and is not the mother of Billy, Carol must be the mother of Billy and in the second house.\n\nFrom clue 7, Alice and the person who loves purple are next to each other. Since Carol is in House 2 and Bob is in House 2, Alice must be in House 3 and the person who loves purple must be in House 4.\n\nFrom clue 1, the Dragonfruit smoothie lover is in the fourth house. Since Arnold loves the Desert smoothie and Bob loves the Darkness smoothie, Arnold cannot be in the fourth house. Therefore, Arnold must be in House 1.\n\n<answer>arnold</answer>",

From clue 4, Carol and the boba tea drinker are next to each other. Since Carol is not in house 1 or 2 (as Arnold is in house 3 and Bob is in house 2), Carol must be in house 4. Therefore, the boba tea drinker who loves soup is in house 1.\n9. From clue 9, the person who smokes Blue Master and the person who loves stir fry are next to each other. Since Carol is in house 4 and loves pizza, the person in house 3 (Arnold) does not love stir fry. Therefore, the person in house 2 (Bob) must love stir fry.\n10. From clue 6, the coffee drinker is the person who is a pizza lover (Carol). Since Carol is in house 4, she cannot be the person who smokes Blue Master or loves stir fry.\n11.

Since Arnold cannot be in House 1 (Bob is there) and cannot be in House 2 (Carol is there), Arnold must be in House 3 or House 4. However, from clue 8, the bird keeper (who loves the boquet of lilies) is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement. This means the person who loves the boquet of lilies must be in House 3, and Arnold must be in House 4.\n\nFrom clue 7, the fish enthusiast loves grilled cheese. Since Arnold loves soup and is in House 4, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3. Therefore, the person who loves the boquet of lilies (the bird keeper) is in House 3.\n\nFrom clue 8, the bird keeper is directly left of the person who loves a carnations arrangement. Since the bird keeper is in House 3, the person who loves a carnations arrangement must be in House 4. However, Arnold is in House 4, so Arnold loves a carnations arrangement.\n\nSince Arnold is in House 4 and loves soup and a carnations arrangement, and Bob is in House 1 and loves pizza and has a cat, the remaining person for House 1 is Alice.\n\n<answer>alice</answer>",

Bob and the person who likes milk are next to each other.\n\nFrom clues 1 and 4, we know that the person who smokes Blue Master is the Chinese coffee drinker.

From clue 5, the British person is the person partial to Pall Mall. So, the British person is in the fourth house.\n\nFrom clue 7, the boba tea drinker is the Dane. From clue 2, Alice is directly left of the boba tea drinker. So, the Dane (boba tea drinker) is in house 3 and Alice is in house 2.\n\nFrom clue 3, the Prince smoker is the one who only drinks water. Since the British person is in the fourth house and smokes Pall Mall, and Carol is the Chinese coffee drinker who smokes Blue Master, the Prince smoker must be in house 1. Since Alice is in house 2, the Prince smoker must be Bob.\n\nFrom clue 9, Bob and the person who likes milk are next to each other.
