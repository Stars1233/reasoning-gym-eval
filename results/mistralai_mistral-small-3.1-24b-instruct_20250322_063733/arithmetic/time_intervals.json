          "full_model_response": "First, let's convert the departure and arrival times to a common time zone to make the calculation easier. We'll use UTC as the common time zone.\n\nThe departure time is 2302-01-23 09:27 -0100. To convert this to UTC, we add 1 hour (since -0100 is 1 hour behind UTC):\n- Departure time in UTC: 2302-01-23 10:27\n\nThe arrival time is 2302-01-26 03:36 -0300. To convert this to UTC, we add 3 hours (since -0300 is 3 hours behind UTC):\n- Arrival time in UTC: 2302-01-26 06:36\n\nNow, let's calculate the duration between these two times:\n\n1. From 2302-01-23 10:27 to 2302-01-23 23:59 is 13 hours and 32 minutes.\n2. From 2302-01-24 00:00 to 2302-01-25 23:59 is 48 hours.\n3. From 2302-01-26 00:00 to 2302-01-26 06:36 is 6 hours and 36 minutes.\n\nAdding these durations together:\n- 13 hours 32 minutes\n- + 48 hours\n- + 6 hours 36 minutes\n- --------------------\n- 68 hours 8 minutes\n\nNow, convert 68 hours 8 minutes into days, hours, and minutes:\n- 68 hours 8 minutes = 2 days 20 hours 8 minutes\n\n<answer>2 days, 20:08</answer>",
