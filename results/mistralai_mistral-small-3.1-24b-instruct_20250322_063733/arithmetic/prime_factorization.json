First, we check if 563 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 563 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.\n2. Next, we check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 563 is 5 + 6 + 3 = 14, which is not divisible by 3, so 563 is not divisible by 3.\n3. We then check divisibility by 5. Since 563 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.\n4. We continue this process with the next prime numbers. We find that 563 is not divisible by 7, 11, or 13.\n5. Finally, we check divisibility by 17. Since 563 \u00f7 17 = 33, we find that 563 is divisible by 17.\n6. We then check if 33 is a prime number. Since 33 is divisible by 3 and 11, we find that 33 = 3 \u00d7 11.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 563 is:\n\n<answer>17 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 11</answer>",

First, check if 561 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 561 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.\n2. Next, check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 561 is 5 + 6 + 1 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 561 is divisible by 3.\n3. Divide 561 by 3 to get 187.\n4. Now, check if 187 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 187 is 1 + 8 + 7 = 16, which is not divisible by 3.\n5. Check divisibility by the next prime number, which is 5. Since 187 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.\n6. Check divisibility by 7. 187 divided by 7 is approximately 26.71, which is not an integer, so 187 is not divisible by 7.\n7. Check divisibility by 11. 187 divided by 11 is approximately 17, which is an integer. Therefore, 187 is divisible by 11.\n8. Divide 187 by 11 to get 17.\n9.
