4\n- 2x2 grids:\n  - Top-left grid (positions (1,1)-(2,2))\n  - Top-right grid (positions (1,3)-(2,4))\n\nRow 1:  \nPosition (1,2) is 3 (already filled)  \nPositions (1,1), (1,3), (1,4) are empty.\n\nCheck column 2:  \n- Has 3  \nCheck column 4:  \n- Has 1 (row 2) and 3 (row 3)  \nCheck column 3:  \n- Has 2 (row 3)  \n\n---\n\nStep 2: Fill row 2:\n\nRow 2: _ _ _ 1  \nNumbers missing: 2, 3, 4  \nColumn 4 has 1 (fixed)  \nColumn 2 has 3 in row 1, so row 2, col 2 can't be 3  \nColumn 3 has 2 in row 3, so row 2, col 3 can't be 2  \n\nLet's look at the 2x2 blocks:\n\nTop-left block (rows 1-2, cols 1-2):\n- Contains 3 (row 1, col 2)\n- Missing 1, 2, 4  \nSince row 2, col 2 can't be 3, and column 2 is missing 2 and 4  \nRow 2, col 1 is missing 2, 3, 4  \nRow 2, col 2 is missing 2, 4  \nNo immediate fill.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Look at row 3:\n\nRow 3: _ _ 2 3  \nMissing: 1, 4  \nColumn 4 has 3  \nColumn 3 has 2  \nColumn 1 and 2 are empty  \nCheck columns:  \nColumn 1: missing 1, 4  \nColumn 2: missing 1, 4  \n\nCheck the bottom-left 2x2 grid (rows 3-4, cols 1-2):  \n- Row 3, col 1 and col 2 missing  \n- Row 4 all missing  \nNo immediate fill.\n\n---\n\nStep 4: Row 4 is entirely empty: _ _ _ _  \nMissing: 1, 2, 3, 4  \n\n---\n\nStep 5: Let's fill what we can confidently.\n\nLook at column 1:\n\n- Row 1: missing  \n- Row 2: missing  \n- Row 3: missing  \n- Row 4: missing  \n\nNo filled cells, so move on.\n\n---\n\nStep 6: Column 2:\n\n- Row 1: 3  \n- Row 2: missing  \n- Row 3: missing  \n- Row 4: missing  \n\nNo immediate fill.\n\n---\n\nStep 7: Column 3:\n\n- Row 1:

Row 2: 1  \n- Row 3: 3  \n- Row 4: missing  \n\nNumbers missing: 2, 4  \nSince row 3 has 3, row 2 has 1, so the missing numbers in column 4 are 2 and 4.\n\n---\n\nStep 9: Now, back to row 1, position (1,4):\n\n- Column 4 missing 2 and 4  \n- Row 1 missing 1, 2, 4  \n- In top-right 2x2 grid, row 2, col 4 is 1, so remaining numbers are 2, 3, 4  \n- But since row 1, col 2 is 3, so (1,3) and (1,4)

No conflicts, but since row 4 is missing all, no immediate fill.\n\n---\n\nStep 11: Since possibilities are tight, let's try filling:\n\nAssuming row 3, col 1 is 1, then row 3, col 2 is 4  \nCheck if this conflicts:\n\nRow 3: 1 4 2 3  \nVerify columns:  \n- Column 1:  \n  Row 1: missing  \n  Row 2: missing  \n  Row 3: 1  \n  Row 4: missing  \n- Column 2:  \n  Row 1: 3  \n  Row 2: missing  \n  Row 3: 4  \n  Row 4: missing  \n\nNo conflicts yet.\n\n---\n\nStep 12: Now, row 2:\n\nRow 2: _ _ _ 1  \nMissing: 2, 3, 4  \nColumn 4 is 1  \nColumn 3 has 2 (row 3), so row 2, col 3 cannot be 2, so options are 3, 4  \nColumn 2 has 3 (row 1), so row 2, col 2 cannot be 3, options 2, 4  \nColumn 1 no filled numbers yet.\n\nTop-left grid has 3 (row 1, col 2)  \nTop-right grid has 1 (row 2, col 4)\n\nTry filling row 2:\n\nRow 2, col 3: 4  \nRow 2, col 2: 2  \nRow 2, col 1: 3  \n\nSo row 2 is: 3 2 4 1\n\nCheck for conflicts:  \n- Column 2:  \n  Row 1: 3  \n  Row 2: 2  \n  Row 3: 4  \n  Row 4: missing  \nNo conflicts  \n- Column 1:  \n  Row 2: 3  \n  Row 3: 1  \nNo conflicts  \n- Column 3:  \n  Row 2: 4  \n  Row 3: 2  \nNo conflicts  \n- Column 4:  \n  Row 2: 1  \n  Row 3: 3  \nNo conflicts\n\n---\n\nStep 13: Now, row 1:\n\nRow 1: _ 3 _ _  \nMissing: 1, 2, 4  \nRow 2 is 3 2 4 1\n\nColumn 3:  \nRow 3: 2  \nRow 2: 4  \nSo missing in column 3 is 1 and 3, but row 1, col 3 can't be 3 (already in row 1), so must be 1 or 4  \nBut since 4 is in row 2, col 3, row 1, col 3 cannot be 4, so it must be 1  \nRow 1, col 3 = 1\n\nRow 1: _ 3 1 _\n\nNow, column 4:  \nRow 2: 1  \nRow 3: 3  \nRow 1 missing  \nRow 1, col 4 missing 2 or 4  \nIn row 1, missing numbers are 2 and 4  \nCheck column 4:  \nRow 3 has 3  \nRow 2 has 1  \nSo missing 2 and 4  \nNo conflict, but in top-right grid, row 2, col 4 is 1, so the other numbers are 2, 3, 4  \nRow 1, col 4 missing 2 or 4  \nColumn 1:  \nRow 1 missing  \nRow 2 has 3  \nRow 3 has 1  \nSo missing 2 and 4  \nRow 1, col 1 missing 2 or 4\n\nRow 1 is now: _ 3 1 _\n\n---\n\nStep 14: Now, bottom row 4:\n\nRow 4: _ _ _ _  \nMissing 1, 2, 3, 4  \nColumn 1:  \nRow 3 has 1  \nRow 2 has 3  \nSo missing 2 and 4  \nColumn 2:  \nRow 3 has 4  \nRow 2 has 2  \nSo missing 1 and 3  \nColumn 3:  \nRow 3 has 2  \nRow 2 has 4  \nSo missing 1 and 3  \nColumn 4:  \nRow 3 has 3  \nRow 2 has 1  \nSo missing 2 and 4\n\nBottom-left grid (rows 3-4, cols 1-2):  \nRow 3: 1 4  \nRow 4: missing  \nMissing 2 and 3  \nSo row 4, col 1 and col 2 are 2 and 3\n\nSimilarly, bottom-right grid (rows 3-4, cols 3-4):  \nRow 3: 2 3  \nRow 4: missing  \nMissing 1 and 4\n\nAssign:\n\nRow 4: 2 3 4 1\n\nCheck columns:  \nColumn 1:  \nRow 3: 1  \nRow 4: 2  \nOK  \nColumn 2:  \nRow 3: 4  \nRow 4: 3  \nOK  \nColumn 3:  \nRow 3: 2  \nRow 4: 4  \nOK  \nColumn 4:  \nRow 3: 3  \nRow 4: 1  \nOK\n\n---\n\nStep 15: Now, back to row 1:\n\nRow 1: _ 3 1 _  \nMissing 2 and 4  \nColumn 1:  \nRow 2: 3  \nRow 3: 1  \nRow 4: 2  \nMissing 4  \nSo row 1, col 1 = 4  \nRow 1:

this conflicts:\n\nRow 3: 1 4 2 3  \nVerify columns:  \n- Column 1:  \n  Row 1: missing  \n  Row 2: missing  \n  Row 3: 1  \n  Row 4: missing  \n- Column 2:  \n  Row 1: 3  \n  Row 2: missing  \n  Row 3: 4  \n  Row 4: missing  \n\nNo conflicts yet.\n\n---\n\nStep 12: Now, row 2:\n\nRow 2: _ _ _ 1  \nMissing: 2, 3, 4  \nColumn 4 is 1  \nColumn 3 has 2 (row 3), so row 2, col 3 cannot be 2, so options are 3, 4  \nColumn 2 has 3 (row 1), so row 2, col 2 cannot be 3, options 2, 4  \nColumn 1 no filled numbers yet.\n\nTop-left grid has 3 (row 1, col 2)  \nTop-right grid has 1 (row 2, col 4)\n\nTry filling row 2:\n\nRow 2, col 3: 4  \nRow 2, col 2: 2  \nRow 2, col 1: 3  \n\nSo row 2 is: 3 2 4 1\n\nCheck for conflicts:  \n- Column 2:  \n  Row 1: 3  \n  Row 2: 2  \n  Row 3: 4  \n  Row 4: missing  \nNo conflicts  \n- Column 1:  \n  Row 2: 3  \n  Row 3: 1  \nNo conflicts  \n- Column 3:  \n  Row 2: 4  \n  Row 3: 2  \nNo conflicts  \n- Column 4:  \n  Row 2: 1  \n  Row 3: 3  \nNo conflicts\n\n---\n\nStep 13: Now, row 1:\n\nRow 1: _ 3 _ _  \nMissing: 1, 2, 4  \nRow 2 is 3 2 4 1\n\nColumn 3:  \nRow 3: 2  \nRow 2: 4  \nSo missing in column 3 is 1 and 3, but row 1, col 3 can't be 3 (already in row 1), so must be 1 or 4  \nBut since 4 is in row 2, col 3, row 1, col 3 cannot be 4, so it must be 1  \nRow 1, col 3 = 1\n\nRow 1: _ 3 1 _\n\nNow, column 4:  \nRow 2: 1  \nRow 3: 3  \nRow 1 missing  \nRow 1, col 4 missing 2 or 4  \nIn row 1, missing numbers are 2 and 4  \nCheck column 4:  \nRow 3 has 3  \nRow 2 has 1  \nSo missing 2 and 4  \nNo conflict, but in top-right grid, row 2, col 4 is 1, so the other numbers are 2, 3, 4  \nRow 1, col 4 missing 2 or 4  \nColumn 1:  \nRow 1 missing  \nRow 2 has 3  \nRow 3 has 1  \nSo missing 2 and 4  \nRow 1, col 1 missing 2 or 4\n\nRow 1 is now: _ 3 1 _\n\n---\n\nStep 14: Now, bottom row 4:\n\nRow 4: _ _ _ _  \nMissing 1, 2, 3, 4  \nColumn 1:  \nRow 3 has 1  \nRow 2 has 3  \nSo missing 2 and 4  \nColumn 2:  \nRow 3 has 4  \nRow 2 has 2  \nSo missing 1 and 3  \nColumn 3:  \nRow 3 has 2  \nRow 2 has 4  \nSo missing 1 and 3  \nColumn 4:  \nRow 3 has 3  \nRow 2 has 1  \nSo missing 2 and 4\n\nBottom-left grid (rows 3-4, cols 1-2):  \nRow 3: 1 4  \nRow 4: missing  \nMissing 2 and 3  \nSo row 4, col 1 and col 2 are 2 and 3\n\nSimilarly, bottom-right grid (rows 3-4, cols 3-4):  \nRow 3: 2 3  \nRow 4: missing  \nMissing 1 and 4\n\nAssign:\n\nRow 4: 2 3 4 1\n\nCheck columns:  \nColumn 1:  \nRow 3: 1  \nRow 4: 2  \nOK  \nColumn 2:  \nRow 3: 4  \nRow 4: 3  \nOK  \nColumn 3:  \nRow 3: 2  \nRow 4: 4  \nOK  \nColumn 4:  \nRow 3: 3  \nRow 4: 1  \nOK\n\n---\n\nStep 15: Now, back to row 1:\n\nRow 1: _ 3 1 _  \nMissing 2 and 4  \nColumn 1:  \nRow 2: 3  \nRow 3: 1  \nRow 4: 2  \nMissing 4  \nSo row 1, col 1 = 4  \nRow 1: 4 3 1 _\n\nColumn 4:  \nRow 2: 1  \nRow 3: 3  \nRow 4: 1  \nMissing 2 and 4  \nRow 1 missing 2 or 2?  \nNo, only 2 remains.  \nRow 1, col 4 = 2\n\n---\n\nFinal solution:\n\n4 3 1 2  \n3 2 4 1  \n1 4 2

Missing numbers: 1, 2, 4.\n- Second cell (row 4, column 2) can't be 1 (since 1 is in column 2, row 1), so options are 2 or 4.\n\nAfter filling carefully and checking constraints, the completed puzzle is:\n\n2 1 3 4  \n4 3 2 1  \n1 4 1 2  \n3 2 4 1  \n\nWait, but in the third row, I have two 1s, which is invalid. Let's correct that.\n\nBetter approach:\n\nFirst, fill easy spots:\n\n- Box 1 (top-left): we have _ 1 / 4 _  \nWe have 1 and 4, missing 2 and 3.\n\n- Box 2 (top-right): _ _ / _ _  \nBut column 4 has 2 in row 3, so row 1, column 4 can't be 2.\n\nLet's fill step-by-step.\n\nRow 1: _ 1 _ _  \nColumns 1 and 3 empty.  \nColumn 1 can't be 4 (since row 2, col 1 is 4).  \nSo possibilities for row 1:  \ncol 1: 2 or 3  \ncol 3: 2, 3, 4\n\nRow 2: 4 _ _ _  \ncol 2 can't be 1 (row 1, col 2 is 1), so col 2 is 2 or 3.  \ncol 3: missing numbers are 1, 2, 3  \ncol 4: missing numbers are 1, 2, 3\n\nRow 3: _ _ _ 2  \ncol 1 missing 1, 2, 3, 4, but 4 is in col 1, so not 4.  \ncol 2 missing 1, 2, 3, 4, but 1 is in col 2 (row 1), so not 1.  \ncol 3 missing 1, 3, 4\n\nRow 4: 3 _ _ _  \ncol 2 missing 1, 2, 4  \ncol 3 missing 1, 2, 4  \ncol 4 missing 1, 2, 4, but 2 is in col 4 (row 3), so not 2.\n\nNow, box 3 (bottom-left):  \nRow 3, col 1  \nRow 4, col 1 is 3  \nRow 3, col 2  \nRow 4, col 2\n\nWe can see row 3, col 1: possible 1 or 2  \nBut 2 is in row 3, col 4, so this must be 1  \nSo row 3, col 1 = 1\n\nRow 3: 1 _ _ 2\n\nNow, box 3:  \nRow 4, col 1 is 3  \nRow 3, col 2: missing 3 or 4 (since 1 is in row 3, col 1; 2 is in row 3, col 4)  \nRow 4, col 2: missing 2 or 4 (since 3 is in row 4, col 1, and 1 is in col 2, row 1)\n\nLet's look at box 2 (top-right):  \nRow 1, col 3 and 4  \nRow 2, col 3 and 4\n\nRow 1, col 4:  \nNumbers missing: 2, 3, 4  \nBut 2 is in col 4 (row 3), so can't be 2  \n3 is not in col 4  \n4 is not in col 4  \nSo possible 3 or 4\n\nRow 1, col 3:  \nNumbers missing: 2, 3, 4  \nCheck col 3: no numbers yet  \nNo restriction, so possible 2, 3, 4\n\nRow 2, col 3:  \nRow 2 missing 1, 2, 3  \nCol 3 missing all  \nBox missing 1, 2, 3, 4  \nBut 1 is in row 1, col 2  \nSo possible 2, 3, 4\n\nRow 2, col 4:  \nRow 2 missing 1, 2, 3  \nCol 4 missing 1, 3, 4 (2 is in row 3)  \nSo possible 1 or 3\n\nNow, box 4 (bottom-right):  \nRow 3, col 3: missing 3 or 4  \nRow 3, col 4: 2 (given)  \nRow 4, col 3: missing 2 or 4 (since 3 is in row 4, col 1)  \nRow 4, col 4: missing 1 or 4 (since 2 is in col 4, row 3, and 3 is in row 4, col 1)\n\nLet's test some placements:\n\nRow 3 is 1 _ _ 2  \nMissing 3,4 in cols 2 and 3  \nCol 2 in row 3: possible 3 or 4  \nCol 3 in row 3: possible 3 or 4\n\nIf we place 3 at row 3, col 2, then 4 at row 3, col 3  \nThen row 4, col 2 is missing 2 or 4  \nBut 4 is in row 3, col 3, so row 4, col 2 is 2  \nThen row 4, col 3 is missing 4  \nRow 4, col 4 is missing 1\n\nLet's write that out:\n\nRow 3: 1 3 4 2  \nRow 4: 3 2 4 1\n\nNow, row 2:\n\nRow 2 is 4 _ _ _  \nMissing 1, 2, 3  \nCol 2:  \nIn col 2, rows 1 and 4 are 1 and 2  \nSo missing 3 and 4, but 4 is in row 2, so can't be 4, must be 3  \nRow 2, col 2 = 3\n\nRow 2, col 3: missing 1 or 2  \nCol 3: rows 3 and 4 are 4 and 4 (wait, two 4s?)
