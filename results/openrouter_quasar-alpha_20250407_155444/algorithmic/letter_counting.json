Yes, at position 1\n- \"straightway\" \u2192 \n   - s\n   - t (1)\n   - r\n   - a\n   - i\n   - g\n   - h\n   - t (2)\n   - w\n   - a\n   - y\n\nSo \"straightway\" contains 2 \"t\"s.\n\n- \"You\" \u2192 0\n\nSum of all \"t\"s:\n\n- \"reporters\": 1\n- \"this\": 1\n- \"straightway\": 2\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n\n<answer>4</answer>",
