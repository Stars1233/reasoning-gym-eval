Since Matilda is a colleague of Sarah, and Sarah's circle includes Matilda, then Sarah and Matilda are colleagues.\n\nIs the other female in John's circle a colleague of Matilda? Yes, since all in John's circle are colleagues of each other.\n\nIs there any other female? No.\n\nSo, Matilda's female colleagues:\n- Sarah\n- The other female in John's circle\n\nTotal: 2 female colleagues.\n\n<answer>2</answer>",
