There can be more.\n\nStatement 3 says: \"Exactly 5 are true.\"\n\nStatement 4 says: \"Exactly 4 are false.\"\n\nSince 7 statements total, \"exactly 4 false\" implies 3 true statements.\n\nSo Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (5 true vs 3 true).\n\nStatement 5 says: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\" (exclusive or).\n\nIf Statement 5 is true, then one of Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both.\n\nIf Statement 5 is false, then either both are true or both are false.\n\nBut we have just said both cannot be true (since 5\u22603 true statements). So Statement 5 being false would mean both Statement 3 and 4 are false.\n\nNow, consider possibilities:\n\n---\n\n**Case 1:** Statement 3 is true (exactly 5 true statements)\n\nIf Statement 3 is true, then total true statements = 5.\n\nSince Statement 2 is false, total true statements is not 7.\n\nStatement 3 is true, so total true statements = 5.\n\nStatement 4 says \"Exactly 4 are false\" \u2192 3 true.

So possible.\n\nCheck S3: \"exactly 1 true\" \u2192 false.\n\nS4: \"exactly 7 false\" \u2192 all false \u2192 so S4 is true? But then at least one true statement (S4), contradiction.\n\nSo not all false.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only consistent solutions are:\n\n- Only S7 is true (1 true, 6 false)\n- None true \u2192 impossible (contradicts S4)\n- All false \u2192 impossible\n- All true \u2192 impossible\n- Exactly 2 true \u2192 no\n- Exactly 3 or more true \u2192 contradictions\n\n**Therefore, unique solution: only S7 is true.**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

Contradicts total true = 3.\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Try total true = 5\n\nIs prime? Yes (5 is prime). Statement 6 true.\n\nNumber of false = 2 \u2192 2 is prime \u2192 Statement 7 is false.\n\nNumber of false at most 2 \u2192 Statement 2: \"at most 2 false\" \u2192 true.\n\nStatement 1: \"at least 7 true\" \u2192 false.\n\nStatement 3: \"exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false.\n\nStatement 4: \"exactly 5 false\" \u2192 false.\n\nStatement 5: \"either 3 or 4 true, not both\" \u2192 both false, so Statement 5 is false.\n\nTrue statements: 2, 6.\n\nTotal = 2, contradicts total true = 5. No.\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Try total true = 6\n\nIs prime? No (6 is composite), Statement 6 is false. So no.\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Try total true = 7\n\nIs prime? No (7 is prime), so Statement 6 is true.\n\nStatement 1: \"at least 7 true\" \u2192 yes, 7 true \u2192 Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: \"at most 2 false\" \u2192 false (zero false), so \"at most 2 false\" is true \u2192 Statement 2 is true.\n\nStatement 3: \"exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false, since 7 true \u2192 Statement 3 is false \u2192 contradicts Statement 1 being true (since then Statement 3 would be true).

Let's test this:\n\n- 7 true statements \u2192 0 false statements.\n- Statement 2: \"At most 3 false\" \u2192 true (since 0 \u2264 3).\n- Statement 3: \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false (since all 7 are true).\n- Statement 4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 false (since 0 false).\n- Statement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 true, but not both\" \u2192 both 3 and 4 are false, so XOR false \u2192 statement 5 is false.\n- But statement 5 is assumed true (since all are true). Contradiction.\n\n**So statement 1 cannot be true** \u2192 less than 7 true statements.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Possible number of true statements**\n\nBecause statement 1 is false, \"At least 7 true\" is false \u2192 so fewer than 7 true statements.\n\nStatement 2 says \"At most 3 false\" \u2192 if true, then up to 3 false statements (so 4 or more true).\n\nStatement 3 says \"Exactly 4 true\".\nStatement 4 says \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 which is equivalent to 4 true.\n\nStatements 3 and 4 both say the same thing (4 true, 3 false), but one states the number of true, the other false.\n\nStatement 5: \"Either statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both.\" So if 5 is true, then exactly one of statements 3 and 4 is true.\nIf 5 is false, then both are true or both are false.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Assume statement 3 is true (\"Exactly 4 true statements\")**\n\nIf statement 3 is true:\n\n- Total true statements = 4.\n- So statement 4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 matches with 4 true, 3 false \u2192 so statement 4 is also true.\n- But then statement 5 (\"either 3 or 4 but not both\") would be **false** (since both 3 and 4 are true).\n- So true statements: 3, 4, and possibly others.\n\nSo far, true statements: 3 and 4.\n\nIs statement 2 true?

The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Logical relations between statements**\n\n- Statement 2: \"At most 1 are false\" \u2192 means **at least 6** are true.\n- Statement 1: \"At least 2 are true\" \u2192 always true if Statement 2 is true (since at least 6 true).\n- So, if Statement 2 is true, then Statement 1 is definitely true.\n\n- Statement 3: exactly 4 true\n- Statement 4: exactly 3 false \u2192 equivalent to exactly 4 true (since 7 - 3 = 4)\n- Statement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 is true, but not both\" \u2192 so only one of Statements 3 or 4 can be true, not both.\n\nBut since Statements 3 and 4 say the same thing (4 true, 3 false), both can't be true simultaneously, but they could both be false or one true, one false.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Possible total number of true statements**\n\nPossible numbers of true statements are 0 through 7.\n\nFrom Statement 1 (\"at least 2 true\"): total true \u2265 2, so 0 or 1 true is impossible.\n\nFrom Statement 2 (\"at most 1 false\"): total true \u2265 6, so the possible total true are 6 or 7 if Statement 2 is true.\n\nFrom Statement 3 (\"exactly 4 true\"): total true = 4 if true.\n\nFrom Statement 4 (\"exactly 3 false\"): total false = 3, so total true = 4 if true.\n\nStatement 6: true if total true is a prime number (2,3,5,7).\n\nStatement 7: true if total false is composite (4,6,...). Since total false = 7 - total true.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Test possible total number of true statements**\n\nLet's test total true counts from 2 to 7.\n\n- **Total true = 7**: all statements true.\n\nCheck consistency:\n\n1. \"At least 2 true\" \u2192 true (OK)\n2. \"At most 1 false\" \u2192 true (but contradicts total true=7 \u2192 total false=0, so \"at most 1 false\" is true)\n3. \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false (since 7 true)\n4. \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 false (since 0 false)\n5. \"Either 3 or 4 true but not both\" \u2192 since both are false, this is false\n6. \"Number of true is prime (7)\" \u2192 true\n7. \"Number of false is composite (0)\" \u2192 0 is neither prime nor composite \u2192 statement is false\n\nSo, true statements are 1,2,6 (3 total). But that contradicts total true=7. So impossible.\n\n---\n\n- **Total true = 6**\n\nThen total false=1.\n\nCheck:\n\nStatement 2: \"At most 1 false\" \u2192 true (since only 1 false)\nStatement 1: \"At least 2 true\" \u2192 true\nStatement 3: \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false\nStatement 4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 false\nStatement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 true but not both\" \u2192 since both are false, so statement is false\nStatement 6: \"Number of true is prime (6)\" \u2192 false (6 is composite)\nStatement 7: \"Number of false is composite (1)\" \u2192 1 is neither prime nor composite \u2192 false\n\nSo true statements are 1 and 2 (2 total), which is consistent with total true=6? No, because only 2 true contradicts total 6 true.\n\nSo, impossible.\n\n---\n\n- **Total true = 5**\n\nTotal false=2.\n\nStatement 1: \"At least 2 true\" \u2192 true\nStatement 2: \"At most 1 false\" \u2192 false (since 2 false)\nStatement 3: \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false\nStatement 4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 false\nStatement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 true but not both\" \u2192 since both false, statement is false\nStatement 6: \"Number of true is prime (5)\" \u2192 true\nStatement 7: \"Number of false is composite (2)\" \u2192 2 is prime \u2192 so statement is false\n\nTrue statements: 1 and 6 (2 total), which contradicts total true=5. So impossible.\n\n---\n\n- **Total true = 4**\n\nTotal false=3.\n\nStatement 1: \"At least 2 true\" \u2192 true\nStatement 2: \"At most 1 false\" \u2192 false (since 3 false)\nStatement 3: \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 true\nStatement 4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 true\nStatement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 true but not both\" \u2192 since both 3 and 4 are true, Statement 5 is false\nStatement 6: \"Number of true is prime (4)\" \u2192 false (4 is composite)\nStatement 7: \"Number of false is composite (3)\" \u2192 3 is prime \u2192 so false\n\nTrue statements: 1,3,4 (3 total), but total true is supposed to be 4, so one missing.\n\nCandidate is Statement 5, which is false (since both 3 and 4 are true, violating XOR). So 3 true statements contradicts total 4 true statements.\n\nImpossible.\n\n---\n\n- **Total true = 3**\n\nTotal false=4.\n\nStatement 1: \"At least 2 true\" \u2192 true\nStatement 2: \"At most 1 false\" \u2192 false (since 4 false)\nStatement 3: \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false\nStatement 4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 false (since 4 false)\nStatement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 true but not both\" \u2192 since both 3 and 4 are false, statement is false\nStatement 6: \"Number of true is prime (3)\" \u2192 true\nStatement 7: \"Number of false is composite (4)\" \u2192 true (4 is composite)\n\nTrue statements: 1,6,7 (3 total), matches total true=3. Consistent.\n\nCheck if any contradictions:\n\n- Statement 3 is false: total true \u2260 4 \u2192 matches\n- Statement 4 is false: total false \u2260 3 \u2192 matches\n- Statement 5 is false: both 3 and 4 are false \u2192 matches\n- Statement 2 is false: total false > 1 \u2192 matches\n\nYes, consistent.\n\n---\n\n- **Total true = 2**\n\nTotal false=5.\n\nStatement 1: \"At least 2 true\" \u2192 true\nStatement 2: \"At most 1 false\" \u2192 false (since 5 false)\nStatement 3: \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false\nStatement 4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 false\nStatement 5: \"Either 3 or 4 true but not both\" \u2192 both false, so statement is false\nStatement 6: \"Number of true is prime (2)\" \u2192 true\nStatement 7: \"Number of false is composite (5)\" \u2192 5 is prime \u2192 so false\n\nTrue statements: 1 and 6 (2 total), matches total true=2.\n\nIs this consistent? Yes.\n\n---\n\n- **Summary:**\n\nWe found consistent solutions with total true statements = 3 (statements 1,6,7 true) and total true statements = 2 (statements 1,6 true). Let's verify if both are possible.\n\n- For total true=3: statements 1,6,7 true\n- For total true=2: statements 1,6 true\n\nAre both consistent with all statements? Yes.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Count number of solutions**\n\nFrom above, two consistent truth assignments exist:\n\n- Solution A: Statements 1,6,7 true (3 true)\n- Solution B: Statements 1,6 true (2 true)\n\nIs there any other? For total true = 3 or 2, we've found consistent sets.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThere are **2** possible consistent truth assignments satisfying all statements.\n\n<answer>2</answer>",

Let's check:\n  - S2: \"at most 2 false\" \u2014 with 1 false, true.\n  - S6: \"number of true statements is prime\" \u2014 6 true, 6 is not prime \u2192 false.\n  - S7: false count is 1, which is not composite \u2192 S7 is false.\n\nNumber of true statements: only S2, so 1 true. Contradicts assumption of 6 true. So **not 6 true**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Check for exactly 5 true\n\n- Then, 2 false.\n- S1: false (since less than 7 true).\n- S3: false (since less than 7 true).\n- S4: \"exactly 5 false\" \u2014 no, only 2 false, so false.\n- S5: Both S3 and S4 false, so S5 false.\n- S2: \"at most 2 false\" \u2014 true (since 2 false).\n- S6: 5 true, 5 is prime \u2192 true.\n- S7: 2 false, 2 is prime (not composite) \u2192 S7 false.\n\nTrue statements: S2 and S6 (2 true), 5 false.\n\nIs this consistent?\n\n- S6 says number of true statements is prime (2) \u2192 yes.\n- S7 is false, so no conflict.\n- S2 says \"at most 2 false\", and we have exactly 2 false, so S2 true.\n\nNumber of true: 2 (prime), false: 5 (composite). S7 says \"number of false statements is composite\" so since number of false is 5 (prime), S7 is false, matching assumption.\n\nIs S4 false? S4 says 5 false; we have 5 false, so S4 would be **true**, contradiction since we assumed S4 false. So this case is inconsistent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Check for exactly 4 true\n\n- 3 false.\n- S1: false.\n- S3: false.\n- S4: \"5 false\" \u2014 only 3, so false.\n- S5: both S3 and S4 false, so S5 false.\n- S2: \"at most 2 false\" \u2014 no, 3 false, so S2 false.\n- S6: 4 true, 4 not prime \u2192 false.\n- S7: 3 false, 3 is prime, so S7 false.\n\nNumber of true: 0 (since all statements are false). Contradicts assumption of 4 true. So discard.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Check for exactly 3 true\n\n- 4 false.\n- S1: false.\n- S3: false.\n- S4: \"5 false\" \u2014 only 4, so false.\n- S5: both S3 and S4 false, so S5 false.\n- S2: \"at most 2 false\" \u2014 no, false.\n- S6: 3 true, 3 is prime, so true.\n- S7: 4 false, 4 is composite, so true.\n\nTrue statements: S6 and S7 (2 true), contradicts assumption of 3 true. Discard.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Check for exactly 2 true\n\n- 5 false.\n- S1: false.\n- S3: false.\n- S4: \"5 false\" \u2014 yes, so true.\n- S5: Exactly one of S3 or S4 true. S4 true, S3 false, so S5 true.\n- S2: \"at most 2 false\" \u2014 no, false.\n- S6: 2 true, 2 is prime, so true.\n- S7: 5 false, 5 is prime (not composite), so false.\n\nCount of true statements: S4, S5, S6 \u2192 3 true, contradicts assumption of 2 true. Discard.\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Check for exactly 1 true\n\n- 6 false.\n- S1: false.\n- S3: false.\n- S4: \"5 false\" \u2014 no, false.\n- S5: S3 and S4 both false, so S5 false.\n- S2: \"at most 2 false\" \u2014 no, false.\n- S6: 1 true, 1 is not prime, so false.\n- S7: 6 false, 6 is composite, so true.\n\nTrue statements: only S7, matches assumption of 1 true.\n\nCheck consistency:\n\n- S7 says number of false statements is composite (6), yes.\n- S6 is false, so no conflict.\n- S5 is false, so no conflict.\n\nNumber of true statements = 1 (not prime), matches S6 false.\n\nNumber of false statements = 6 (composite), matches S7 true.\n\nIs S2 false? S2 says \"at most 2 false\", but 6 false, so S2 false, consistent.\n\nIs S4 false? S4 says \"5 false\", but 6, so false, consistent.\n\nIs S5 false? Both S3 and S4 false, so S5 false, consistent.\n\nIs S1 false? Less than 7 true, so false, consistent.\n\nIs S3 false? Less than 7 true, so false, consistent.\n\nEverything consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Check for exactly 0 true\n\n- Then all statements false.\n- S1 false, consistent.\n- S2 false (\"at most 2 false\"), inconsistent with all false.\n- S3 false, consistent.\n- S4 false (\"5 false\"), but all false means 7 false, so false, consistent.\n- S5 false, consistent.\n- S6 false, consistent.\n- S7 false, says \"false statements composite\", 7 false, 7 is prime, so S7 false, consistent.\n\nNumber of true statements is zero (not prime), matches S6 false.\n\nNumber of false statements is 7 (prime), S7 says composite, so false, consistent.\n\nAll consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 12: Summary of consistent cases:\n\n- **Exactly 1 true statement (S7 true):** Consistent.\n- **Exactly 0 true statements:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 13: Number of possible solutions\n\n- Two consistent truth assignments:\n  - One with only S7 true.\n  - One with all statements false.\n\n---\n\n<answer>2</answer>",

Let T be the total number of TRUE statements, F = 7 - T the number of FALSE statements.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Statement 2**\n\n- \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false\" means **all statements are true** (since max 0 false).\n- So, if Statement 2 is true, then **all 7 statements are true**.\n\nBut Statement 2 says at most 0 false \u2192 all true, so:\n\n- If S2 is true, then S2 is true, and all others are true.\n\nIs this consistent?\n\n- Check Statement 4: \"Exactly 3 of these statements are false\" \u2192 It claims 3 false, but under S2 true, all are true \u2192 Contradiction.\n- So, S4 is false.\n- But under S2 true, all statements should be true, including S4 \u2192 Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 cannot be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Statement 2 is false**\n\n- So, there are **more than 0 false statements** \u2192 at least 1 false statement.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Statement 1**\n\n- \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true\" \u2192 So, T \u2265 4, if S1 is true.\n- If S1 is false, then fewer than 4 are true, i.e., T \u2264 3.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Statement 3**\n\n- \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true\"\n- If S3 is true, then T = 4.\n- If S3 is false, then T \u2260 4.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Statement 4**\n\n- \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false\"\n- So, F = 3, T = 4, if S4 is true.\n- If S4 is false, then F \u2260 3.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Analyze Statement 5**\n\n- \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\" \u2192 Exclusive OR (XOR)\n- So, (S3 true AND S4 false) OR (S3 false

F = 3, T = 4\n- Both give same numbers.\n\nBut S5 says only one of S3 or S4 is true, not both.\n\nTherefore, **only one of S3 or S4 can be true**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 8: Determine which of S3 and S4 is true**\n\nSuppose **S3 is true (T=4)**:\n\n- Then S4: \"Exactly 3 are false\" \u2192 F=3 \u2192 Consistent with T=4.\n- So S4 would also be true \u2192 contradicts S5 (only one is true).\n\nSuppose **S4 is true (F=3)**:\n\n- Then T=4.\n- S3: \"Exactly 4 are true\" \u2192 T=4 \u2192 so S3 is also true \u2192 again contradicts S5.\n\nSo, if T=4, both S3 and S4 would be true, but S5 says only one is true.\n\nTherefore, **both S3 and S4 cannot be true simultaneously**.\n\nThus, **both S3 and S4 must be false**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 9: If S3 and S4 are both false, then S5**\n\nS5: \"Either S3 or S4 is true, but not both\"\n\n- Since both are false, S5 is **false**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 10: Count true statements**\n\nS3, S4, S5 = false.\n\nS2 is false (from Step 1).\n\nRemaining: S1, S6,

S5 are false \u21d2 At most 3 false so far.\n\nAssuming S1 is true:\n\n- Current true statements: S1 + ?\n\nIf S1 is true, total true \u2265 4.\n\nIf S1 is false, total true \u2264 3.\n\n---\n\n**Step 12: Analyze Statements 6 and 7**\n\nS6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number\"\n\nS7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number\"\n\nPossible T and F:\n\n- T=3 (prime), F=4

13: Tentative assignment**\n\nSuppose S1 is **false**:\n\n- Then fewer than 4 true statements, so T \u2264 3.\n\nFrom above, possible T values are 2 or 3.\n\nIf T=3:\n\n- Number of false statements =

\u2192 4 \u2192 composite \u2192 S7 is true\n\nWe have:\n\n- True: S6, S7, plus one more to reach T=3.\n\nCandidates: S1 (assumed false), S2 false, S3 false, S4 false, S5 false\n\nSo, only S6 and S7 are true so far.\n\nTo reach T=3, one more is true.\n\nWhich one?\n\n---\n\n**Step 14: Candidate for third true statement**\n\nIf S1 is true:\n\n- Then T \u2265 4, contradicts assumption T=3 \u2192 No.\nIf S1 is false, then T \u2264 3 \u2192 consistent.\n\nSimilarly, S2, S3, S4, S5 are false (from earlier).\n\nSo, only candidates for true statements are S6, S7, and possibly S1.\n\nBut S1 is false in this scenario.\n\nSo only S6 and S7 true \u2192 T=2, but 2 is prime, 5 false statements, 5 is not composite (it's prime), so S7 would be false, contradicting assumption S7 true.\n\nIf T=3, F=4, both primes/composites consistent with S6 and S7 true.\n\nWe need one more true statement.\n\nCandidates left: S1, S2, S3, S4, S5.\n\nEarlier established that S5 is false if both S3 and S4 are false (which is the case here). So S5 is false.\n\nS2 is false (from Step 1).\n\nS1 is false (assumed).\n\nAre S3 and S4 true? Both cannot be true (from Step 8). Both are false.\n\nSo only S6 and S7 are true.\n\nThus, T=2, F=5.\n\nCheck S6: \"Number of true statements is prime\" \u2192 2 \u2192 yes, so S6 is true (consistent).\n\nCheck S7: \"Number of false statements is composite\" \u2192 5 \u2192 prime, so S7 would be false (contradiction).\n\nSo at T=2, S7 is false, so only S6 is true, T=1, which is not prime, contradiction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 15: Conclusion: T=3, F=4**\n\nTrue statements: S6, S7, and one of S1, S2, S3, S4, S5.\n\nFrom above, S2, S3, S4, S5 are false.\n\nTherefore, **S1 must be true** to reach 3 true statements.\n\nCheck:\n\n- S1: true\n- S6: true\n- S7: true\n\nOthers: false.\n\nVerify:\n\nS1: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true\" \u2192 We have only 3 true \u2192 contradicts S1 true.\n\nSo S1 cannot be true if only 3 true statements.\n\nTherefore, S1 is false.\n\nBack to 2 true statements \u2192 S6 true and S7 true.\n\nBut as above, S7 would be false if 5 false statements (5 is prime), so contradiction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 16: Try T=4**\n\nIf T=4 (number of true statements is 4), then S6:\n\n- \"Number of true statements is prime\" \u2192 4 is not prime \u2192 S6 is false.\n\nS7:\n\n- Number of false statements = 3 \u2192 3 is prime \u2192 S7 is false.\n\nSo S6 and S7 both false.\n\nAlready have S2, S3, S4, S5 false.\n\nThen only S1 can be true, but S1 says \"at least 4 true\" \u2192 consistent with T=4.\n\nBut S3: \"Exactly 4 true\" is false, so T\u22604? Contradiction.\n\nNo, S3 is false because T\u22604? But T=4? Contradiction.\n\nNo, S3: \"Exactly 4 are true\", if T=4, then S3 is true, but we had earlier that S3 and S4 cannot both be true, and S5 is false, so both S3 and S4 are false.\n\nBut if T=4, then S3 is true, contradicting that S3 is false.\n\nTherefore, T\u22604.\n\n---\n\n**Step 17: Try T=5**\n\nThen F=2 (prime), so S7: \"Number of false statements is composite\" \u2192 2 prime \u2192 S7 is false.\n\nS6: 5 true, 5 is prime \u2192 S6 true.\n\nS3: \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false (since 5), so S3 false.\n\nS4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 false (since 2), so S4 false.\n\nS5: \"Either S3 or S4 is true, not both\" \u2192 both false, so S5 false.\n\nS2: \"At most 0 false\" \u2192 false (2 false), so S2 false.\n\nS1: \"At least 4 true\" \u2192 yes (5 true), so S1 true.\n\nNow, total true statements: S1, S6, plus 3 more.\n\nWhich?\n\nSo far true: S1, S6.\n\nAssuming S7 is false (since 2 is prime, so S7 is false).\n\nWe need 5 true statements, so 3 more.\n\nCandidates: S2, S3, S4, S5, S7.\n\nS7 is false, S3, S4, S5 are false, S2 is false.\n\nSo only 2 true statements \u2192 contradiction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 18: Try T=6**\n\nThen F=1 (prime), so S7 is false.\n\nS6: 6 true, 6 is not prime \u2192 S6 false.\n\nSo less than 6 true, contradiction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 19: Try T=1**\n\nThen S6: 1 is not prime \u2192 S6 false.\n\nS7: 6 false, 6 is composite \u2192 S7 true.\n\nOnly 1 true statement: S7.\n\nCheck S1: \"At least 4 true\" \u2192 false.\n\nS2: \"At most 0 false\" \u2192 false.\n\nS3: \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false.\n\nS4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 false.\n\nS5: \"Either S3 or S4 true but not both\" \u2192 both false, so S5 false.\n\nS6: false.\n\nS7: true.\n\nNumber of true: 1 \u2192 consistent.\n\nNumber of false: 6 \u2192 composite \u2192 consistent with S7 true.\n\nS6 is false because number of true is 1 (not prime).\n\nS7 is true (number of false is composite).\n\nS1 is false (at least 4 true is false).\n\nS2 is false (at most 0 false is false).\n\nS3 is false (exactly 4 true is false).\n\nS4 is false (exactly 3 false is false).\n\nS5 is false (both S3 and S4 are false, so S5 is false).\n\nAll consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Step 20: Verify S1 is false**\n\nS1: \"At least 4 true\" \u2192 only 1 true, so false.

true**\n\nSuppose **S3 is true (T=4)**:\n\n- Then S4: \"Exactly 3 are false\" \u2192 F=3 \u2192 Consistent with T=4.\n- So S4 would also be true \u2192 contradicts S5 (only one is true).\n\nSuppose **S4 is true (F=3)**:\n\n- Then T=4.\n- S3: \"Exactly 4 are true\" \u2192 T=4 \u2192 so S3 is also true \u2192 again contradicts S5.\n\nSo, if T=4, both S3 and S4 would be true, but S5 says only one is true.\n\nTherefore, **both S3 and S4 cannot be true simultaneously**.\n\nThus, **both S3 and S4 must be false**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 9: If S3 and S4 are both false, then S5**\n\nS5: \"Either S3 or S4 is true, but not both\"\n\n- Since both are false, S5 is **false**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 10: Count true statements**\n\nS3, S4, S5 = false.\n\nS2 is false (from Step 1).\n\nRemaining: S1, S6, S7.\n\n---\n\n**Step 11: Analyze Statement 1**\n\nIs S1 true or false?\n\n- Recall, S1: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true\"\n- So if S1 is true, then T \u2265 4.\n\nBut so far, S2, S3, S4, S5 are false \u21d2 At most 3 false so far.\n\nAssuming S1 is true:\n\n- Current true statements: S1 + ?\n\nIf S1 is true, total true \u2265 4.\n\nIf S1 is false, total true \u2264 3.\n\n---\n\n**Step 12: Analyze Statements 6 and 7**\n\nS6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number\"\n\nS7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number\"\n\nPossible T and F:\n\n- T=3 (prime), F=4 (composite)\n- T=4 (not prime), F=3 (not composite)\n- T=5 (prime), F=2 (not composite)\n- T=2 (prime), F=5 (composite)\n- T=6 (not prime), F=1 (not composite)\n- T=1 (not prime), F=6 (composite)\n- T=7 (prime), F=0 (not composite)\n\nBut since S2 is false, there is at least 1 false statement, so T \u2260 7.\n\nAlso, S5 is false (from earlier), S3 and S4 are false, S2 is false.\n\n---\n\n**Step 13: Tentative assignment**\n\nSuppose S1 is **false**:\n\n- Then fewer than 4 true statements, so T \u2264 3.\n\nFrom above, possible T values are 2 or 3.\n\nIf T=3:\n\n- Number of false statements = 4 (composite)\n- Number of true statements = 3 (prime)\n\nCheck S6:\n\n- \"Number of true statements is prime\" \u2192 3 \u2192 S6 is true\n\nCheck S7:\n\n- \"Number of false statements is composite\" \u2192 4 \u2192 composite \u2192 S7 is true\n\nWe have:\n\n- True: S6, S7, plus one more to reach T=3.\n\nCandidates: S1 (assumed false), S2 false, S3 false, S4 false, S5 false\n\nSo, only S6 and S7 are true so far.\n\nTo reach T=3, one more is true.\n\nWhich one?\n\n---\n\n**Step 14: Candidate for third true statement**\n\nIf S1 is true:\n\n- Then T \u2265 4, contradicts assumption T=3 \u2192 No.\nIf S1 is false, then T \u2264 3 \u2192 consistent.\n\nSimilarly, S2, S3, S4, S5 are false (from earlier).\n\nSo, only candidates for true statements are S6, S7, and possibly S1.\n\nBut S1 is false in this scenario.\n\nSo only S6 and S7 true \u2192 T=2, but 2 is prime, 5 false statements, 5 is not composite (it's prime), so S7 would be false, contradicting assumption S7 true.\n\nIf T=3, F=4, both primes/composites consistent with S6 and S7 true.\n\nWe need one more true statement.\n\nCandidates left: S1, S2, S3, S4, S5.\n\nEarlier established that S5 is false if both S3 and S4 are false (which is the case here). So S5 is false.\n\nS2 is false (from Step 1).\n\nS1 is false (assumed).\n\nAre S3 and S4 true? Both cannot be true (from Step 8). Both are false.\n\nSo only S6 and S7 are true.\n\nThus, T=2, F=5.\n\nCheck S6: \"Number of true statements is prime\" \u2192 2 \u2192 yes, so S6 is true (consistent).\n\nCheck S7: \"Number of false statements is composite\" \u2192 5 \u2192 prime, so S7 would be false (contradiction).\n\nSo at T=2, S7 is false, so only S6 is true, T=1, which is not prime, contradiction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 15: Conclusion: T=3, F=4**\n\nTrue statements: S6, S7, and one of S1, S2, S3, S4, S5.\n\nFrom above, S2, S3, S4, S5 are false.\n\nTherefore, **S1 must be true** to reach 3 true statements.\n\nCheck:\n\n- S1: true\n- S6: true\n- S7: true\n\nOthers: false.\n\nVerify:\n\nS1: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true\" \u2192 We have only 3 true \u2192 contradicts S1 true.\n\nSo S1 cannot be true if only 3 true statements.\n\nTherefore, S1 is false.\n\nBack to 2 true statements \u2192 S6 true and S7 true.\n\nBut as above, S7 would be false if 5 false statements (5 is prime), so contradiction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 16: Try T=4**\n\nIf T=4 (number of true statements is 4), then S6:\n\n- \"Number of true statements is prime\" \u2192 4 is not prime \u2192 S6 is false.\n\nS7:\n\n- Number of false statements = 3 \u2192 3 is prime \u2192 S7 is false.\n\nSo S6 and S7 both false.\n\nAlready have S2, S3, S4, S5 false.\n\nThen only S1 can be true, but S1 says \"at least 4 true\" \u2192 consistent with T=4.\n\nBut S3: \"Exactly 4 true\" is false, so T\u22604? Contradiction.\n\nNo, S3 is false because T\u22604? But T=4? Contradiction.\n\nNo, S3: \"Exactly 4 are true\", if T=4, then S3 is true, but we had earlier that S3 and S4 cannot both be true, and S5 is false, so both S3 and S4 are false.\n\nBut if T=4, then S3 is true, contradicting that S3 is false.\n\nTherefore, T\u22604.\n\n---\n\n**Step 17: Try T=5**\n\nThen F=2 (prime), so S7: \"Number of false statements is composite\" \u2192 2 prime \u2192 S7 is false.\n\nS6: 5 true, 5 is prime \u2192 S6 true.\n\nS3: \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false (since 5), so S3 false.\n\nS4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 false (since 2), so S4 false.\n\nS5: \"Either S3 or S4 is true, not both\" \u2192 both false, so S5 false.\n\nS2: \"At most 0 false\" \u2192 false (2 false), so S2 false.\n\nS1: \"At least 4 true\" \u2192 yes (5 true), so S1 true.\n\nNow, total true statements: S1, S6, plus 3 more.\n\nWhich?\n\nSo far true: S1, S6.\n\nAssuming S7 is false (since 2 is prime, so S7 is false).\n\nWe need 5 true statements, so 3 more.\n\nCandidates: S2, S3, S4, S5, S7.\n\nS7 is false, S3, S4, S5 are false, S2 is false.\n\nSo only 2 true statements \u2192 contradiction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 18: Try T=6**\n\nThen F=1 (prime), so S7 is false.\n\nS6: 6 true, 6 is not prime \u2192 S6 false.\n\nSo less than 6 true, contradiction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 19: Try T=1**\n\nThen S6: 1 is not prime \u2192 S6 false.\n\nS7: 6 false, 6 is composite \u2192 S7 true.\n\nOnly 1 true statement: S7.\n\nCheck S1: \"At least 4 true\" \u2192 false.\n\nS2: \"At most 0 false\" \u2192 false.\n\nS3: \"Exactly 4 true\" \u2192 false.\n\nS4: \"Exactly 3 false\" \u2192 false.\n\nS5: \"Either S3 or S4 true but not both\" \u2192 both false, so S5 false.\n\nS6: false.\n\nS7: true.\n\nNumber of true: 1 \u2192 consistent.\n\nNumber of false: 6 \u2192 composite \u2192 consistent with S7 true.\n\nS6 is false because number of true is 1 (not prime).\n\nS7 is true (number of false is composite).\n\nS1 is false (at least 4 true is false).\n\nS2 is false (at most 0 false is false).\n\nS3 is false (exactly 4 true is false).\n\nS4 is false (exactly 3 false is false).\n\nS5 is false (both S3 and S4 are false, so S5 is false).\n\nAll consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Step 20: Verify S1 is false**\n\nS1: \"At least 4 true\" \u2192 only 1 true, so false.
