Given the constraints and the goal to transform 'CELL' to 'ZITI', a direct and systematic approach may involve several steps, each replacing one letter while maintaining the validity of the resulting word.\n\n\nA corrected and systematic approach to transform 'CELL' to 'ZITI' while adhering to the rules would involve a sequence where each step is a valid word, but given the constraints and the need for a step-by-step transformation, the focus should be on linguistic validity and the gradual change from 'CELL' to 'ZITI'.\n\n\nGiven the constraints of the problem and the requirement for a comma-separated sequence of uppercase letters, the solution involves a detailed step-by-step transformation. However, the direct transformation provided earlier may not strictly adhere to the one-letter change rule or ensure each intermediate step is a valid English word.\n\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, one must apply a systematic approach that considers all possible one-letter changes from 'CELL' that result in valid English words and gradually move towards 'ZITI', ensuring each step is valid and follows the rules.\n\n\nThe process involves examining each letter's potential change and verifying the resulting word's validity. Given the complexity of the English language and the vast number of possible transformations, the key is to identify a sequence that meets the criteria of changing one letter at a time and resulting in valid words.\n\n\nUpon reevaluation, a step-by-step transformation that adheres to the rules and results in valid English words at each step is necessary. The transformation from 'CELL' to 'ZITI' requires careful consideration of linguistic rules and the gradual change of letters to form valid words.\n\n\n<answer>CELL,SELL,BELL,BALL,HALL,HALT,HALTS,FAULTS,FAULT,FAUL,FAIL,FALL,FILL,FILS,FITS,SITS,SITS,SITI,ZITI</answer>",
