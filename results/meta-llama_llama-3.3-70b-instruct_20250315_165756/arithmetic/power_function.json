The operation can be rewritten as 1 / (-384.3865^2).\n\n## Step 1: Calculate the square of -384.3865\nFirst, we square -384.3865. The square of a negative number is positive, so (-384.3865)^2 = 384.3865^2.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the squaring\n384.3865^2 = 147,851.1969225.\n\n## Step 3: Take the reciprocal\nNow, we take the reciprocal of 147,851.1969225, which is 1 / 147,851.1969225.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the reciprocal\nThe reciprocal of 147,851.1969225 is approximately 0.00000676.\n\n## Step 5: Express the result in scientific notation\nTo express 0.00000676 in scientific notation, we move the decimal point to the right until we have a number between 1 and 10, then multiply by 10 raised to the power of the negative number of places we moved the decimal. So, 0.00000676 becomes 6.76 * 10^-6.\n\n## Step 6: Round to 3 significant figures\nRounding 6.76 to 3 significant figures gives us 6.76.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.76e-6}$",
