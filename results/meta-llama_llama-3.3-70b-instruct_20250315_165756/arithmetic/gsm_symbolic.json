We know that in cold water, Bob swims a kilometer in 22 minutes. In warm water, he swims a kilometer in 4 minutes more than 2 times as long as in cold water. \n\nSo, 2 times as long as in cold water is 2 * 22 = 44 minutes. \n4 minutes more than that is 44 + 4 = 48 minutes.\n\nThus, Bob swims a kilometer in 48 minutes in warm water.\n\nSince the problem asks about hot days but only provides information about cold and warm water, we'll assume \"hot day\" refers to the conditions described as \"warm water\" for the purpose of this calculation, as there's no specific information given about swimming times on a \"hot day.\"\n\nNow, let's calculate how long it takes Bob to swim 4 kilometers in cold water and in warm water (assumed to be the condition for a \"hot day\" based on the given information):\n\n- In cold water, Bob swims a kilometer in 22 minutes. So, for 4 kilometers, it would take 22 * 4 = 88 minutes.\n- In warm water (hot day), Bob swims a kilometer in 48 minutes. So, for 4 kilometers, it would take 48 * 4 = 192 minutes.\n\nThe difference in time to swim 4 kilometers on a \"hot day\" (warm water) compared to a cold day is 192 - 88 = 104 minutes.\n\n<answer>104</answer>",

The probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 2/4 (since there are 2 odd numbers out of 4 possible outcomes), and the same goes for the second roll, as the die rolls are independent.

Since there are 3 numbers greater than 1 (2, 3, 4) out of 4 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4), the probability is 3/4.\n\nNext, calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row. The odd numbers on a 4-sided die are 1 and 3. The probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 2/4 (since there are 2 odd numbers out of 4 possible outcomes), and the same goes for the second roll, as the die rolls are independent. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (2/4) * (2/4) = 4/16 = 1/4.\n\nNow, to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 1 than to roll two odd numbers in a row, subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 1: 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nTo express this difference as a percentage, convert 1/2 to a percentage: (1/2) * 100 = 50%.\n\nTherefore, it is 50% more likely that Joseph rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.\n\n<answer>50</answer>",

Michael saw the comet a second time when he was 4 times the age his uncle was when he saw the Comet. So, Michael was 4 * 24 = 96 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the time elapsed between the two sightings of the comet by Michael.\nSince Comet Encke orbits the sun every 55 years, the time between Michael's two sightings of the comet must be a multiple of 55 years.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the age of Michael when he saw the comet for the first time.\nLet's denote the age of Michael when he saw the comet for the first time as x. Then, the time elapsed between the two sightings is 96 - x. This time must be a multiple of 55 years.\n\n## Step 4: Find the multiple of 55 years that fits the given conditions.\nWe need to find a multiple of 55 that, when subtracted from 96, gives us a reasonable age for Michael's first sighting of the comet. Since 55 * 1 = 55 and 96 - 55 = 41, this could be a possible age. However, we should check if there's another multiple of 55 that could also work.\n\n## Step 5: Check for other possible multiples of 55.\nThe next multiple of 55 would be 55 * 2 = 110, which is greater than 96. Therefore, the only viable option is 55 years.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate Michael's age at the first sighting of the comet.\nGiven that 96 - x = 55 (since 55 is the time elapsed between sightings and it's the only viable multiple of 55 that fits), we solve for x: x = 96 - 55.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{41}$",
