Moving on to the next prime number, 3, it's also not divisible by 3. The next prime number is 5, but 489 is not divisible by 5. Continuing, 7 is the next prime number, and upon division, 489 \u00f7 7 = 69.87, which is not a whole number, so 7 is not a factor. Moving on, 11 is the next prime number, and 489 \u00f7 11 = 44.45, which is not a whole number. The next prime is 13, and 489 \u00f7 13 = 37.615, which is also not a whole number. Trying the next prime, 17, 489 \u00f7 17 = 28.7647, not a whole number. The next prime is 19, and 489 \u00f7 19 = 25.737, not a whole number.

The next prime is 31, and 489 \u00f7 31 = 15.774, which is also not a whole number. Trying 37, 489 \u00f7 37 = 13.216, not a whole number. Then, 41, 489 \u00f7 41 = 11.927, not a whole number. The next prime, 43, 489 \u00f7 43 = 11.372, not a whole number. Finally, trying 47 and 53, neither of which divides 489 evenly, we reach 61 and then 67, but neither is a factor.

However, 751 is a bit large for manual checks of each small prime, so let's consider its properties. \n\n751 is not even, so it's not divisible by 2. Adding its digits (7 + 5 + 1 = 13), we see that the sum is not a multiple of 3, so it's not divisible by 3. It doesn't end in 5 or 0, so it's not divisible by 5. For 7, we take the last digit (1), multiply it by 2 (2*1 = 2), and subtract this product from the remaining digits (75 - 2 = 73). Since 73 is not divisible by 7, neither is 751.\n\nMoving on, we can check divisibility by higher primes or look for a more systematic apprize 751. Goach to factoriven its size, it's more efficient to test divisibility starting from the smallest primes upwards or to use a calculator/method for prime factorization for larger numbers.\n\nUpon inspection or calculation, we find that 751 is actually a prime number itself.

Since 13 is a prime number, the division stops here.\n\n## Step 6: Write down the prime factorization of 936\nFrom the steps above, we have 936 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13</answer>",
