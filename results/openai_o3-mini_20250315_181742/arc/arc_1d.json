(In our examples when the very last input element is a zero the shift drops the last number; when the last input element is nonzero it \u201csurvives\u201d in the output\u2019s last column.) \n\nFor instance, in Example\u00a03 the input\n\u2003\u20035 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2 0\ntransforms by inserting a 0 at the beginning and shifting right to yield\n\u2003\u20030 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2.\nIn Example\u00a02 the input\n\u2003\u20030 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 0 3\u2003\u2003(with a nonzero [3] at the end)\nshifts to form\n\u2003\u20030 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 3\n\u2014the last element (3) is preserved rather than replaced by a 0.\n\nUsing that rule on the test input\n\u2003\u20030 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\u2003\u2003\n(note the input ends with 6, a nonzero) we insert a 0 at the beginning and shift the rest one position to the right so that all but the last element come from the input (with the input\u2019s last element being \u201cpreserved\u201d in the output\u2019s final slot).

In particular, if the original last element is 0 then you simply drop the last element of the enlarged list; but if the original last element is nonzero then you drop the element immediately before the last (so that the new list still ends with that nonzero digit).\n\nChecking the examples:\n\u2022 Example\u202f1 input ends with 0 so we prepend 0 and drop the final element.\n\u2022 Example\u202f2 input ends with 3 (nonzero) so we prepend 0 and drop the element immediately before the final 3.\n\u2022 Example\u202f3 input ends with 0 so we prepend 0 and drop the final element.\n\nNow, for the test input:\n\u2003Input: 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\nThe last element is 6 (nonzero).

In every example the only changes occur in the upper two rows. In the input the very top row is split into a left block of a nonzero \u201cvalue\u201d and a right block of 0\u2019s (although sometimes there is a small block of that same nonzero value tacked onto the end) while the entire second row is made up of the \u201cbackground\u201d 0\u2019s. In the output the top row \u201cabsorbs\u201d almost all of the nonzero value (so that its left block becomes longer) while the remaining cells become 0\u2019s; in fact, the total number of that nonzero tile in the changed top row stays constant and the second row becomes a uniform row of 0\u2019s. In every example the lower rows remain exactly as they were. (Thus the rule is to \u201cslide\u201d some of the nonzero tile values from the top row\u2019s right\u2010end to the left so that the first row becomes \u201cmore filled\u201d and the second row becomes all zero.) \n\nI then applied that rule to the test input grid.

In every example the input grid is read row\u2010by\u2010row (with 15 cells arranged in 3 rows of 5 cells), and one locates in the top row the single contiguous block of 2\u2019s. If that block has two elements (as in Example\u00a02) then only its first cell is \u201cstamped\u201d (by replacing the 2 with an 8) while if it has three or more (Examples\u00a01 and\u00a03) then the left\u2013most two cells become 8\u2019s. On the next row the \u201cstamp\u201d is shifted one cell to the right; if the shifted \u201cstamp\u201d falls partly outside the contiguous block in that row then only those parts that cover a 2 are stamped (if a stamp \u201cfalls off\u201d an edge, the corresponding cell (if originally 2) is changed to 0). (Note that all 0\u2019s remain 0.) Finally, the stamp is shifted again on the third row. When we work through the three examples we recover exactly the given output grids.

In every row you \u201cmark\u201d one or more of the original 2\u2019s by multiplying by 4. The examples show that if a row is not \u201cpure\u201d (i.e. not all three entries are 2) then on even\u2010numbered rows the lone/trailing 2 becomes an 8 while odd\u2010numbered rows remain unchanged. Conversely, if the entire row is 2\u2019s then on even rows you convert every 2 except the right\u2010most one, whereas on odd rows you only change the first 2. (Rows that are all zeros remain the same.)\n\nBreaking the test grid (15 numbers) into five rows of three we have:\n\u2003Row0: 0 0 2\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192\u20030 0 8\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(non\u2010pure even row so change trailing 2)\n\u2003Row1: 2 2 2\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192\u20038 2 2\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(pure odd row so change first cell)\n\u2003Row2: 2 2 2\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192\u20038 8 2\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(pure even row so change all but last)\n\u2003Row3: 0 0 0\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192\u20030 0 0\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(unchanged)\n\u2003Row4: 2 2 2\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2192\u20038 8 2\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(pure even row so change all but last)\n\nThus the final output grid is: 0 0 8 8 2 2 8 8 2 0 0 0 8 8 2.",

In the \u201coutput\u201d list the first group has been lengthened by three entries while the last group has been shortened by three entries; the middle block remains unchanged. (For example, in Example\u00a01 the input\u2019s first group of seven 3\u2019s becomes ten 3\u2019s in the output, the middle group of ten 0\u2019s remains ten 0\u2019s, and the last group of seven 3\u2019s is reduced to four 3\u2019s.) Checking the other examples confirms that the rule is: \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Identify the initial run (group A), the distinct block (group B) and the final run (group C).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 In the output, make a new A of length (original A length + 3), then B unchanged, and finally a new C of length (original C length \u2212 3). \nWhen we apply this to the test input \n\u2003\u20030 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nwe note that there is an initial run A of six 0\u2019s, followed by a block B that is the single digit 2, then a final run C of the remaining 17 0\u2019s. According to the rule the output\u2019s first group should have 6+3 = 9 zeros, the block remains a single 2, and the final group should have 17\u20133 = 14 zeros. (Indeed, in Examples\u00a01\u20133 the only change is exactly that: extend group A by three and shorten group C by three.) \n\nThus the test output grid is:\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

I then \u201cread\u201d the test grid as a 3\u00d78 grid. The first row has a 0 in the first column and then a row of 2\u2019s; because these 2\u2019s have void immediately beneath them (since in row2 most positions are 0) they get \u201cpainted\u201d (turned to 8\u2019s). In row2 the lone 2 in column\u202f1 is exposed so it becomes 8 while the other cells are 0. The bottom row (row3) is taken as the base so is left unchanged.

(When the grid is all the same value no change occurs.) For example, in Example\u00a01 the block of 6\u2019s at the start loses two 6\u2019s, and those two are instead appended onto the trailing 6\u2019s; similarly in Example\u00a03 the initial block of 6\u2019s shortens by 2 while the ending block lengthens by 2, with the middle block of 0\u2019s left unchanged.\n  \nFor the test input, the outer value is 0 and the inner value is 7.

After testing various hypotheses against the three examples the rule that consistently reproduced the sample outputs was that any contiguous block of 2\u2019s in a row is \u201caccented\u201d by converting a leading segment to 8, with the rule being particularly strict on blocks that extend to the grid\u2019s right side. Then I applied that same rule to the test input grid (a 4\u00d77 grid) to obtain the final output.\n",

When the zero\u2010group is framed on both sides by nonzero numbers each boundary position gets changed; when the zero\u2013group abuts an edge only the zero adjacent to the nonzero is replaced. For example, in a row \u201c4 0 0 5 5\u201d the two zeros are between 4 and 5, so both become 3\u2019s (yielding \u201c4 3 3 5 5\u201d).

In the examples the grid always has 15 numbers arranged as three rows of five. Noticing that the transformation left all nonzero entries unchanged and \u201cfilled in\u201d certain zero\u2010cells with 3, I examined each row\u2019s groups of contiguous zeros. I found that if a row\u2019s group of zero(s) is \u201csandwiched\u201d (i.e. preceded and followed by a nonzero within that row) then every zero in that group is replaced by 3. If instead the group touches an edge (that is, it is at the start or end of the row) then only its first zero is replaced with 3. (For example, in Example\u00a01 the middle row 1 0 0 8 8 turns into 1 3 3 8 8 while in Example\u00a02 the row 0 1 1 0 0 becomes 3 1 1 3 0.)
