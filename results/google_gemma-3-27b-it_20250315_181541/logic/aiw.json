So, Matilda has at least 5 female colleagues from Jennifer's circle (excluding herself) and 6 female colleagues from John's circle. However, we need to consider overlaps. Since Matilda is the only common colleague between Jennifer and John's circles, the total number of female colleagues Matilda has is 4 (Jennifer's female colleagues) + 6 (John's female colleagues) - 1 (Matilda herself) = 9. But Matilda is a female colleague so we must include her. Since Matilda is part of Jennifer\u2019s group, she knows 3 other female colleagues from Jennifer\u2019s group. She also knows 6 female colleagues from John\u2019s group. Thus, Matilda knows 3 + 6 = 9 female colleagues.\n\n<answer>9</answer>",

This means Matilda is part of both circles.\n4. **Identifying Matilda:** Since Charles has only 1 female colleague, that colleague must be Matilda.\n5. **Matilda's colleagues from Jessica's circle:** Matilda is also a colleague of Jessica, so she is part of Jessica's group of 9 colleagues. Jessica has 6 male and 3 female colleagues, and Matilda is one of them.\n6. **Counting Matilda's female colleagues:** Matilda is female, and she is a colleague of the 2 other female colleagues in Jessica's circle. Additionally, she is a colleague of the 1 female colleague in Charles's circle (which is herself).\n7. **Total female colleagues of Matilda:** Matilda has 2 + 1 = 3 female colleagues.\n\n<answer>3</answer>",
