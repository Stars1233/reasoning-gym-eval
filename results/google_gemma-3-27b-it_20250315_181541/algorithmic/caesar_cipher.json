Looking at common words, \"WO\" could be \"TO\" or \"SO\". If \"WO\" decrypts to \"TO\", the shift is -5 (W -> T, O -> O). If \"WO\" decrypts to \"SO\", the shift is -4 (W -> S, O -> O). Let's test a shift of -3, since the letters are close together in the alphabet.\n\nApplying a shift of -3:\nD -> A\nK -> H\nU -> R\nO -> L\n\nSo DKUO becomes AHRL. This doesn't seem like a valid word.\n\nLet's try a shift of -4:\nD -> Z\nK -> G\nU -> Q\nO -> K\n\nSo DKUO becomes ZGQK. Not a valid word.\n\nLet's try a shift of -5:\nD -> Y\nK -> F\nU -> P\nO -> J\n\nSo DKUO becomes YFPJ. Not a valid word.\n\nLet's look at single letter words. \"DY\" could be \"IT\", \"IS\", \"BE\", \"BY\", \"OR\" etc.\nIf \"DY\" -> \"IT\", the shift is -5 (D->I, Y->T)\nIf \"DY\" -> \"IS\", the shift is -6 (D->I, Y->S)\n\nLet's try shift -6:\nD -> X\nK -> E\nU -> O\nO -> I\n\nDKUO -> XEOI\n\nLet's try shift -7:\nD -> W\nK -> D\nU -> N\nO -> H\n\nDKUO -> WDNH\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the message contains the word \"THE\". If \"KD\" is \"THE\", then the shift is -7 (K->T, D->H).\n\nLet's apply a shift of -7 to the entire message:\nD -> W\nK -> D\nU -> N\nO -> H\n  ->\nW -> P\nO -> H\n  ->\nD -> W\nY -> R\n  ->\nW -> P\nI -> B\n  ->\nK -> D\nM -> F\nM -> F\nE -> X\nW -> P\nE -> X\nV -> O\nK -> D\nD -> W\nY -> R\nB -> U\n  ->\nG -> Z\nY -> R\nB -> U\nU -> N\nC -> V\n  ->\nK -> D\nD -> W\n  ->\nX -> Q\nS -> L\nK -> D\nQ -> M\nK -> D\nB -> U\nK -> D\n\nThis gives us: \"WHPO PH WR PB DFFXPODWRU ZRUNV DW QLDMDU\".

To decrypt, we need to determine the shift value.\n\nLooking at common words, \"OT\" is a likely candidate for \"TO\" or \"OF\". If \"OT\" decrypts to \"TO\", the shift is -5 (O -> T, T -> O).
