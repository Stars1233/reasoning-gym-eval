The non-zero numbers are `2 2 2`. The output is `0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0`. The non-zero numbers are `2 2 2`.

The output grid appears to shift the first non-zero number to the right, effectively removing the first instance of that number and replacing it with zeros. Let's analyze the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n\nThe input has two leading zeros, then a sequence of 5s, and two trailing zeros. The output has two leading zeros, then a zero followed by the 5s, and two trailing zeros. The first 5 is replaced by a zero.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n\nThe input has three leading zeros, then a sequence of 4s, and four trailing zeros.

In other words, move all zeros to the right, keeping the first non-zero number in its original position.\n\nNow let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\nInput: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThe first non-zero number is '2'. We need to move all '0's to the right of the initial sequence of '2's.\nThe input is: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nThe output will be: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n<answer>2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</answer>",

The output has the initial 0s, the 4s, and then the final 0s are removed. It appears the rule is to remove trailing zeros.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\nOutput: 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nThe input has a sequence of 6s, followed by a 0, and then a sequence of 6s. The output has the initial 6s, the 0, and the remaining 6s. It seems the rule is to remove trailing zeros, but there is a 0 in the middle of the sequence. This example doesn't fit the \"remove trailing zeros\" rule. Let's look at the third example.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput: 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8\n\nThe input has a sequence of 8s, followed by a sequence of 0s, and then a sequence of 8s. The output has the initial 8s, the 0s, and then the final 8s. It appears the rule is to remove trailing zeros.\n\nBased on examples 1 and 3, the rule seems to be to remove trailing zeros. Example 2 is a bit strange, but it could be a case where the rule applies. Let's re-examine example 2.\nInput: 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\nOutput: 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nThe output is incorrect. If we were to remove trailing zeros, the output would be 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6. It seems the rule is to replace the first sequence of zeros with a single zero. However, this doesn't fit example 1.\n\nLet's consider another rule. In each example, the rule seems to be to find the first 0 and keep all elements up to and including that 0. Then keep all the elements after the first 0.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\nFirst 0 is at index 0.\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 is incorrect.\n\nLet's try another approach. The rule is to find the first occurrence of a non-zero number and keep all numbers up to that point. Then, keep all numbers after the last occurrence of the non-zero number. The numbers in between are kept as they are.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\nFirst non-zero: 4 at index 8. Last non-zero: 4 at index 14.\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0. This is incorrect.\n\nLet's reconsider removing trailing zeros. The examples are:\n1. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 -> 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n2. 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 -> 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n3. 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 -> 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8\n\nThe rule is to remove trailing zeros.\n\nNow, let's apply the rule to the test input:\nInput: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nOutput: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n</answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2",

The output has the same 0s and 4s, but the trailing 0 is duplicated.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\nOutput: 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nThe input has a sequence of 6s followed by a 0, then more 6s. The output has the initial 6s, then a 0, and then the remaining 6s.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\nOutput: 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8\n\nThe input has a sequence of 8s followed by 0s, and then 8s. The output has the initial 8s, then the 0s, and then the remaining 8s.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce that the rule is to find the first occurrence of a non-zero number, and then replace all subsequent numbers with the first non-zero number until another zero is found. Then, continue with the rest of the input. However, this does not explain the first example.\n\nLooking at the examples again, it appears that the rule is to replace all numbers after the first zero with the number preceding the first zero.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\nThe first zero is at index 0. The preceding number is 0. So, the numbers after the first zero are replaced with 0.\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHowever, this doesn't match the output.\n\nLet's re-examine the examples. It seems that the rule is to find the first '0' and replace all subsequent values with the value immediately *before* the first '0'.\n\nExample 1: Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0. Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0. The first 0 is at index 0. There is no value before the first 0, so the values after the first 0 should remain unchanged.\nThe problem statement says that the first 0 is followed by 0s, then 4s, then 0. So the values after the first 0 are 0s then 4s. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nExample 2: Input: 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6. Output: 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6. The first 0 is at index 4. The preceding value is 6. The output is 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6. This is incorrect.\n\nExample 3: Input: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8. Output: 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8. The first 0 is at index 8. The preceding value is 8. The output is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8. This is incorrect.\n\nThe rule appears to be: find the first '0', and then replace the numbers following the '0' with the number immediately preceding the '0' until another '0' is found.\n\nInput: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nThe first '0' is at index 7. The preceding number is 2. The numbers following the '0' are 0 2 2 2 2 2 2. These are replaced with 2.\nOutput: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2}$",

It appears the non-zero values are moved to the beginning of the grid, sorted in ascending order, and then the original zeros are appended. However, this is not quite correct since 5 and 6 are not in ascending order in the output.\n\nLet's look closer. The non-zero values are moved to the beginning, but the order is reversed. The input has 5 6 3 9. The output has 3 9 5 6, which is 9 6 5 3 reversed. No, that is not correct either.\n\nThe non-zero values in the input are 5, 6, 3, 9. The output has 3, 9, 5, 6. This looks like the non-zero values are moved to the beginning of the output, and sorted in ascending order.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 0 0 1 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 3 0 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero values are 1, 5, and 3. In the output, they are 1, 5, 3. This confirms that the non-zero values are moved to the beginning, and sorted in ascending order.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero values are 8 and 8. In the output, they are 8 and 8. This confirms the rule.\n\nThe rule is to move all non-zero values to the beginning of the grid, and sort them in ascending order. The remaining positions are filled with zeros.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\nInput: 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero values are 6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7.\nSorting these in ascending order gives: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nThe output will be: 1 2 3 4 6 6 7 8 9 0 0 0\n\n<answer>1 2 3 4 6 6 7 8 9 0 0 0</answer>",

Six consecutive 3s map to six 1s.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\nOutput: 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\nFour consecutive 3s map to four 2s. Seven consecutive 3s map to seven 1s.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: 0 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\nOutput: 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nTwo consecutive 3s map to two 2s. Eight consecutive 3s map to eight 1s.\n\nThe rule appears to be:\n- If the number of consecutive '3's is greater than or equal to 5, map '3' to '1'.\n- If the number of consecutive '3's is less than 5, map '3' to '2'.\n- '0' remains '0'.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\nInput: 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n- The first three '3's are less than 5, so they become '2's.\n- '0' remains '0'.\n- The next six '3's are greater than or equal to 5, so they become '1's.\n- '0' remains '0'.\n- '0' remains '0'.\n\nTherefore, the output grid is: 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\n<answer>2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0</answer>",

Let's examine the mappings:\n\n- 0 maps to 0\n- 3 maps to either 1 or 2\n\nIn Example 1, the first five 3s are mapped to 2s, and the next seven 3s are mapped to 1s. The 0 remains 0.\nIn Example 2, the first four 3s are mapped to 2s, and the next eight 3s are mapped to 1s. The 0 remains 0.\nIn Example 3, the first 3 is mapped to 2, the next two 3s are mapped to 2s, and the remaining 3s are mapped to 1s. The 0s remain 0.\n\nThe key seems to be the position of the 3s.  The first few 3s are mapped to 2, and then the rest are mapped to 1. The number of 3s that map to 2 varies. However, the 0s always map to 0.\n\nLet's look at the number of 2s in the output:\nExample 1: five 2s\nExample 2: four 2s\nExample 3: three 2s\n\nThe number of 2s in the output seems to be the number of consecutive 3s at the beginning of the input.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\nInput: 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\nThe input starts with three consecutive 3s, followed by a 0, then six 3s, and finally two 0s.\nSo, the first three 3s should be mapped to 2s. The remaining 3s should be mapped to 1s. The 0s should remain 0s.\n\nOutput: 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\n<answer>2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0</answer>",

The middle section transitions from a series of zeros to a series of eights, then back to zeros. The number of eights is equal to the number of initial zeros plus the number of final zeros. Specifically, there are 4 initial zeros and 4 final zeros, and the output has 8 eights in the middle.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input: `0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0`\n*   Output: `0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\nSimilar to Example 1, the initial and final zeros remain unchanged. The middle section transitions from zeros to nines, then to zeros. The number of nines is equal to the number of initial zeros plus the number of final zeros. There are 4 initial zeros and 4 final zeros, and the output has 8 nines in the middle.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   Input: `0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n*   Output: `0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\nAgain, the initial and final zeros are unchanged. The middle section transitions from zeros to eights, then back to zeros. The number of eights is equal to the number of initial zeros plus the number of final zeros. There are 4 initial zeros and 4 final zeros, and the output has 8 eights in the middle.\n\n**Rule:**\n\nThe rule is to replace the sequence of zeros between the initial and final zeros with a sequence of a non-zero number. The number of repetitions of the non-zero number is equal to the sum of the number of initial zeros and the number of final zeros.\n\n**Applying the rule to the test input:**\n\n*   Input: `0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\nThe initial zeros are 6. The final zeros are 6. Therefore, the number of nines in the middle will be 6 + 6 = 12.\n\nOutput: `0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

Specifically, the rule appears to be:\n\n- 0 is mapped to a sequence of 0s of length 1.\n- 1 is mapped to a sequence of 1s of length 1.\n- 2 is mapped to a sequence of 2s of length 1.\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to be the case when looking at the example outputs. Let's look at the lengths of the sequences of numbers in the outputs.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 1 1 1 1 2 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2\n\nThe 1s are mapped to a sequence of 1s of length 1.\nThe 2s are mapped to a sequence of 2s of length 1.\nThe 0s are mapped to a sequence of 0s of length 1.\n\nLet's look at the number of consecutive identical values and map them to a sequence of that number with length equal to the number of consecutive values.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 1 1 1 1 2 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2\n\nThe input sequence is: 1 1 1 1 2 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0\nThe output sequence is: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2\n\nThe input has 4 consecutive 1s, so the output has 4 consecutive 0s.\nThe input has 1 2, so the output has 1 2.\nThe input has 1 1, so the output has 1 1.\nThe input has 4 consecutive 1s, so the output has 4 consecutive 1s.\n\nThe rule seems to be to replace each number with 0 if it is greater than 1, otherwise, keep the number.\nThen, we need to count the number of consecutive values and output the same number of consecutive values.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\nInput: 0 0 0 2 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 1 0 0 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 -> 0 0 0\n2 -> 0\n0 -> 0\n2 -> 0\n1 -> 1\n0 0 0 -> 0 0 0\n1 1 1 -> 1 1 1\n0 -> 0\n2 -> 0\n1 -> 1\n0 0 -> 0 0\n1 1 -> 1 1\n0 -> 0\n2 -> 0\n0 0 -> 0 0\n0 0 -> 0 0\n\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nFinal Answer:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0",

Then, a '0' is placed in the second position. The remaining elements are formed by repeating the first element until the end of the grid, interspersed with '0's based on the original input.\n\nSpecifically, the rule seems to be:\n1. The first element of the output is the same as the first element of the input.\n2. The second element of the output is always 0.\n3. The remaining elements alternate between the first element of the input and 0, following the pattern of 0s in the input.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given test input:\n\nInput: 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\n1. The first element of the output is 9.\n2. The second element of the output is 0.\n3. The input has '0' in the second position, so we proceed to repeat the first element '9' until we encounter another '0' in the input. The input sequence is 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0. The output will be 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0.\n\n<answer>9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

The last non-zero element '5' is moved to the second-to-last position.\n\n*   **Example 2:** Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1`. Output: `1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1`. The last element '1' is moved to the end. The last non-zero element '1' is moved to the second-to-last position.\n\n*   **Example 3:** Input: `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0`. Output: `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7`. The last element '0' is moved to the end. The last non-zero element '7' is moved to the second-to-last position.\n\nThe rule is as follows:\n1.  Copy all elements from the input grid to the output grid except for the last and last non-zero elements.\n2.  Append the last element of the input grid to the end of the output grid.\n3.  Insert the last non-zero element of the input grid into the second-to-last position of the output grid.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input:\n\nInput: `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4`\n\n1.  The last element is `4`.\n2.  The last non-zero element is `4`.\n3.  The output grid will be: `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4`.\n\n<answer>4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4</answer>",

However, this is not entirely correct.\nLet's re-examine the examples. The rule seems to be:\n- Replace 0 with 2\n- Replace 1 with 1\n- Replace 2 with 1\n\nLet's test this rule on the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 2\nApplying the rule: 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1\nThis doesn't match the output.\n\nLet's analyze the outputs more carefully. It looks like the output is based on the maximum value in the input.\n\nExample 1: The maximum value is 2.  The output replaces all 0s with 2 and leaves 1s and 2s as they are.\nExample 2: The maximum value is 2.  The output replaces all 0s with 2 and leaves 1s and 2s as they are.\nExample 3: The maximum value is 2. The output replaces all 0s with 2 and leaves 1s and 2s as they are.\n\nThe rule is: Find the maximum value in the input grid. Replace all 0s in the input grid with the maximum value. Keep the other numbers as they are.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\nInput: 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0\nThe maximum value in the input is 2.\nReplacing all 0s with 2, we get:\n2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2\n\n<answer>2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2</answer>",

This confirms the rule.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 8 2 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe first two 2s are replaced by 8, then 0 remains 0, then the next four 2s are replaced by 8, and the remaining 2s are replaced by 2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 0 8 2 0 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe first 0 remains 0, the next two 2s are replaced by 8, then 0 remains 0, the next four 2s are replaced by 8, and the remaining 2s are replaced by 2.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: if a cell has value 0, the output cell is 0. If a cell has value 2, and it is part of three or more consecutive 2s, then the output cell is 8. Otherwise, the output cell is 2.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\nInput: 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n\nOutput: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 2 0\n\n<answer>0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 2 0</answer>",

The sequence of 6s continues until we hit 0. The output keeps the initial 6s and then changes to 0 until the last 6.\nExample 2: The first number is 4. The sequence of 4s continues until the end of the input. The output keeps the initial 4s and continues the sequence.\nExample 3: The first number is 6. The sequence of 6s continues until we hit 0.

The shift amount varies depending on the example. The non-zero values are shifted to the right, and the beginning of the grid is filled with zeros.\n\nLet's analyze the shift amounts:\nExample 1: Shift = 11\nExample 2: Shift = 16\nExample 3: Shift = 5\n\nThe shift values don't seem to follow a simple pattern. However, we can observe that the shift amount is the index of the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n\nExample 1: First non-zero number is 1 at index 11. Shift = 11.\nExample 2: First non-zero number is 5 at index 16. Shift = 16.\nExample 3: First non-zero number is 9 at index 5.

The amount of the shift is not constant. Let's look at the position of the first non-zero element in the input and output.\n\nExample 1: First non-zero element is at index 1 in input, and index 8 in output. Shift = 8 - 1 = 7\nExample 2: First non-zero element is at index 14 in input, and index 15 in output. Shift = 15 - 14 = 1\nExample 3: First non-zero element is at index 0 in input, and index 9 in output. Shift = 9 - 0 = 9\n\nLet's examine the length of the grid. All the grids are of length 16.\nThe rule seems to be shifting the non-zero elements to the right by a certain amount, and filling the left side with zeros. The shift amount seems related to the value of the non-zero element. However, this is not clear from the limited examples.\n\nAnother possible rule is to move all non-zero elements to the end of the array.\nExample 1: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -> 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\nThis is not correct.\n\nLet's re-examine the examples.\nExample 1: The 1's are moved to the right. The number of 1's is 7. The shift is 7.\nExample 2: The 6 is moved to the right. The number of 6's is 1. The shift is 1.\nExample 3: The 4's are moved to the right. The number of 4's is 8. The shift is 8.\n\nIt seems the non-zero elements are shifted to the right by the number of non-zero elements.\n\nNow let's apply this rule to the test input:\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\nThe non-zero element is 3, and there are two 3's.\nSo, the 3's should be shifted to the right by 2 positions.\nThe output should be: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0</answer>",

The output has 5s at the beginning and end, with the 0s in the middle. The 0s are moved to the middle, and the 5s are moved to the ends.\n\nThe rule appears to be: identify the unique value (e.g., 0 in Example 1, 0 in Example 2, 0 in Example 3). Move all instances of that unique value to the middle of the output grid, and place all other values at the beginning and end of the output grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\nInput: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n\nThe unique value is 0. There are eight 6s and four 0s.\nThe output will have eight 6s at the beginning, then four 0s, and then eight 6s at the end. However, since the input only has 12 elements, the output will have six 6s, four 0s, and then six 6s.\n\nTherefore, the output will be: 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6.\n\n<answer>6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6</answer>",
