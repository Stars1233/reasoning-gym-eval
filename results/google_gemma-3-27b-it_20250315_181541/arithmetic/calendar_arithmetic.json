Counting back 30 days from June 30, 2022, brings us to May 31, 2022. We have 74 - 30 = 44 days left to count back.\n5. May has 31 days.

We have 88 - 6 = 82 days left to go back.\nFrom September 30, go back 30 days to September 0, which is August 31. We have 82 - 30 = 52 days left to go back.\nFrom August 31, go back 31 days to August 0, which is July 31. We have 52 - 31 = 21 days left to go back.\nFrom July 31, go back 21 days to July 10.\nSo, 88 days before October 6, 2022 is July 10, 2022.\n\nNow we need to find the weekday of July 10, 2022.\nOctober 6, 2022 is a Thursday.\nOctober 6 - 88 days = July 10, 2022\nWe can calculate the number of days between July 10 and October 6.\nJuly: 31 - 10 = 21 days\nAugust: 31 days\nSeptember: 30 days\nOctober: 6 days\nTotal days = 21 + 31 + 30 + 6 = 88 days.\nSince October 6 is a Thursday, we go back 88 days.\n88 mod 7 = 4.\nThursday - 4 days = Sunday.\nSo, July 10, 2022 was a Sunday.\n\nAlternatively,\nOctober 6, 2022 is Thursday.\nWe want to find the weekday 88 days before this.\n88 days = 12 weeks and 4 days (88 = 7 * 12 + 4).\nSo, we go back 12 weeks and 4 days. Going back 12 weeks doesn't change the weekday.\nSo, we just need to go back 4 days from Thursday.\nThursday - 4 days = Sunday.\n\n<answer>Sunday</answer>",
