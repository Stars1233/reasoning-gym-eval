It's based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.  We can also use the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder instead of repeated subtraction.\n\n2. **Apply the Algorithm:**\n   * Divide 720 by 302:  720 = 2 * 302 + 116\n   * Divide 302 by 116:  302 = 2 * 116 + 70\n   * Divide 116 by 70:  116 = 1 * 70 + 46\n   * Divide 70 by 46:   70 = 1 * 46 + 24\n   * Divide 46 by 24:   46 = 1 * 24 + 22\n   * Divide 24 by 22:   24 = 1 * 22 + 2\n   * Divide 22 by 2:    22 = 11 * 2 + 0\n\n3. **The GCD:** The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.
