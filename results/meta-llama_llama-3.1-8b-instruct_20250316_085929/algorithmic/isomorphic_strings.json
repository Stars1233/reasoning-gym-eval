Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n2. Iterate over the characters in the first string and the second string simultaneously using the zip function.\n3. For each pair of characters, add the pair to the first dictionary if the character from the first string is not already a key, or update the value in the dictionary if it is.\n4. Also, add the pair to the second dictionary if the character from the second string is not already a key, or update the value in the dictionary if it is.\n5. If the lengths of the strings are not equal or if the dictionaries are not equal, return False.\n6. If the function has not returned False, return True.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements this:\n\n```python\ndef is_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n\n    map1, map2 = {}, {}\n    for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if c1 in map1 and map1[c1] != c2 or c2 in map2 and map2[c2] != c1:\n            return False\n        map1[c1] = c2\n        map2[c2] = c1\n\n    return True\n```\n\nYou can call this function with the arguments 'oan' and 'ans' to get the result:\n\n```python\nprint(is_isomorphic('oan', 'ans'))  # Output: True\n```",

For each pair of characters, it will check if the character in the first string is already in the first dictionary. If it is, it will check if the corresponding character in the second string matches the one in the dictionary. If not, it will return False.\n5. If the character in the first string is not in the first dictionary, it will check if the character in the second string is already in the second dictionary. If it is, it will return False. If not, it will add the character from the first string to the first dictionary and the character from the second string to the second dictionary.\n6. If it finishes iterating over all characters without returning False, it will return True.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach would be to use a two pointers approach, this would eliminate the need for the dictionaries and improve performance.\n\nHere is the two pointers approach:\n\n```python\ndef is_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    mapping = {}\n    for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if c1 in mapping and mapping[c1] != c2:\n            return False\n        if c1 not in mapping and c2 in mapping.values():\n            return False\n        mapping[c1] = c2\n    return True\n\nprint(is_isomorphic(\"shshbpn\", \"wawalsx\"))  # False\n```",
