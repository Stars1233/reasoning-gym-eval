From statements 3, 4, 6, and 8, we know Carol:\n   - Lives in house 3\n   - Uses Samsung Galaxy S21\n   - Has fish\n   - Is Chinese\n\n3. From statements 5, 7, and 9:\n   - Bob is Danish\n   - Bob owns a dog\n   - Bob is directly left of the German\n   - This means Bob must be in house 2 (since he's left of German who must be in house 3)\n\n4. Statement 10 says Huawei P50 is in house 2, so Bob uses Huawei P50\n\n5. Since Carol is in house 3, and Bob in house 2, and they must be next to each other (Bob left of German), Arnold cannot be in house 2 or 3.\n\n6. Alice must be the German and use Google Pixel 6.\n\n7. Therefore, Arnold must be in house 1.\n\n<answer>arnold</answer>",
