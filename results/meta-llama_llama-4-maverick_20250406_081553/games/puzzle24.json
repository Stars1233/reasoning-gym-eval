We have two 5s, which suggests that we might need to combine them in some way to get closer to 24 or to simplify the problem.\n\nOne approach is to try and get close to 24 by using the larger numbers first. We have 10, which is a significant portion of 24. If we start with 10 and try to add or multiply to get to 24, we can examine different combinations.\n\nLet's start by using the operation that could potentially get us closest to 24 quickly. \n\nIf we do 10 + 5 + (something that equals 9, but we can't directly make 9), it doesn't directly work because we can't directly form 9. However, we can achieve a similar result by considering other operations.\n\nOne potential solution involves using division and multiplication or addition and subtraction in a creative way.\n\nLet's directly form a potential expression:\n5 - 4 = 1, then 1 * 10 = 10, and 10 + (something to make 14, but that's not directly possible) doesn't work directly. However, if we think about 5 * 5 = 25, that's close to 24.\n\nIf we do 5 * 5 = 25, then subtract 10/4 (or 2.5, but we can't directly do that with the numbers), it still doesn't directly work. However, if we adjust our thinking to 5 * 5 - 1 (if we had 1), it would be 24. We can achieve '1' by doing 10/10 or 4/4, but we can't repeat numbers.\n\nLet's directly examine a viable expression:\n(5 - 10/5) * 4 doesn't work directly because (5 - 10/5) equals (5 - 2) = 3, and 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nHowever, if we consider 10/5 = 2, and 5 - 2 = 3, we still need to get to 24. \n\nLet's directly form a viable expression: \n5 * 5 - 10/4 doesn't work because it involves using numbers more than once or not following the order of operations directly.\n\nA potential expression is: \n10 + 5 * 4 - 5 + (rearranging or rethinking) doesn't directly fit.\n\nLet's directly think of a simpler expression: \nIf we do (10 - 5) * (5 - 4) doesn't give 24 directly, but (10 - 4) or (5 + 5) are potential starting points.\n\nOne viable expression is: \n(5 + 5) + 10 + 4 = 24.\n\nLet's directly form the expression without equals: \n5 + 5 + 10 + 4\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>5 + 5 + 4 + 10</answer> is acceptable but a more straightforward representation following the exact numbers and format given is directly achieved by:\n<answer>10 + 5 + 4 + 5</answer> \nHowever, a more conventional and simplified version is \n<answer>5 + 5 + 10 + 4</answer>",

Noting that 4 is one of the numbers, if we can get 6, that would be a straightforward path since 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nLet's try to make 6 using the remaining numbers (10, 5, 3):\n- We can achieve 6 by doing 5 + 3 - 10/5 (no, this uses division and doesn't directly work with the available numbers in a simple manner) or more directly, 10 - 5 + 3 - (no, this doesn't give 6 directly, and it uses subtraction and addition).\n\nHowever, a straightforward way to get 6 is by doing 5 + 3 - (a number that gives us a net result of 2 less, but we can't directly achieve that with a single operation using the remaining numbers without repeating or using numbers not given).\n\nA simpler path is:\n- Noting that we have a 4 and a 3, and if we can get to 2 (since 3 * (some operation) or 4 * (some operation)), one simple path is 10/5 = 2, then 3 * (4 + 2) or simply using the numbers directly in an operation that gives 24.\n\nLet's directly form an expression:\nUsing the numbers and operators, one valid expression is: 3*4 + 10 + (5 - 10 is not valid because it repeats or doesn't directly give a simple path). However, an expression like 4 * (5 + 3 - 10/5) or a simpler form could work.\n\nOne of the valid expressions is: 4 * (10 - 5 + 3)\n\nLet's simplify it:\n4 * (10 - 5 + 3) = 4 * (8) = 32 (which is not 24).\n\nHowever, let's directly check a simpler combination:\n(10 - 3) * (5 - 4 + 3) or similar. Let's directly form it:\n(10 - 3) = 7, (5 - 4 + 3) = 4, so 7 * 4 = 28 (not 24).\n\nLet's directly check:\n5 * 3 + 10 - (a number or operation to adjust) or directly: 5 - 3 = 2, 10 - 4 = 6, then 2 * 6 = 12 (not 24).\n\nHowever, a valid expression is: (5 - 3 + 10/4) doesn't directly work because it involves non-integer division or doesn't directly give 24.\n\nLet's directly form a valid expression:\n3 * (10 - 4) + 5 - 3 doesn't work because it repeats numbers.\n\nOne valid expression is: (10 + 4 + 3 + 5)/ doesn't directly give 24, but if we think: 10 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 22, which is close but not 24.\n\nLet's directly check a valid combination:\n(5 + 3) * (4 - (a number or operation)) or directly using the available numbers.\n\nA straightforward expression that works is:\n3*4 + 10 + 5 - 3 (no, this repeats numbers).\n\nLet's simplify and directly check:\nOne valid expression is: 4 * 5 + 10 - 3 - (a number or operation), let's directly form a valid one.\n\nA valid expression is: 10/5 * 3 * 4\n\nLet's directly check the expression:\n10/5 * 3 * 4 = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24\n\nSo, a valid expression is: 10/5*3*4\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>10/5*3*4</answer>",

However, we can achieve this by doing 10 - 4 - 3, but this uses the numbers more than once.\n\nA simpler way is to directly form 24 using the available numbers and operations.\n\nLet's directly form an expression:\n7 - 4 = 3, then 3 + 3 = 6 (but we can't repeat numbers), or we can think of other operations.\n\nOne valid expression is: 10 + 7 + 4 + 3.\n\nHowever, the task is to make 24, not just to add the numbers.\n\nLet's examine a different combination:\n3 * 10 = 30, which is too high, but if we subtract 7 and add 1 (which we don't have directly), or simply adjust it, we can think of: 3 * (10 - 7 + ?) or similar.\n\nA simpler expression could be: 3 * (7 + 4 - 10).\n\nLet's simplify it: \n7 + 4 = 11, \n11 - 10 = 1, \n3 * 1 = 3 (too low).\n\nLet's think of another combination:\nUsing division or other operations directly might be tricky without a clear path.\n\nOne potential expression is: 10 - 7 + 4 * 3 (or a similar variation).\n\nLet's simplify: \n4 * 3 = 12, \n10 - 7 = 3, \n3 + 12 = 15 (still too low).\n\nHowever, if we adjust our strategy slightly:\n(10 - 3) = 7, \n7 * 4 = 28 (too high), \nbut if we do 7 - 3 = 4, \n4 * (10 - 4) is not valid because it repeats numbers.\n\nLet's directly check a valid combination:\n(7 + 3) * (10 - 4) = 10 * 6 = 60 (too high and not valid because it doesn't directly give 24).\n\nHowever, a simpler valid expression is: \n7 + 10 + 4 + 3 (still just adding the numbers).\n\nLet's directly form 24:\nOne of the valid expressions is: 3 * 7 + 4 - 10 + 24 is not valid because it includes 24 and repeats operations outside the given numbers.\n\nLet's re-examine the numbers and directly form a valid expression:\n(10 - 7) = 3, \n3 * 3 (not possible directly because we can't repeat 3), \nbut if we do: 4 * 3 = 12, \n7 - 10 = -3, \n12 - (-3) = 12 + 3 = 15 (still too low).\n\nA potential valid expression is: \n3 * 10 - 7 + 4 + 7 is not valid (repeats 7).\n\nHowever, a valid expression is: \n10 + 3 * 7 - 4 - 7 is not valid (repeats 7).\n\nLet's directly check a simpler valid expression:\n3 * 4 + 10 + 7 - 3 is not valid (repeats 3).\n\nHowever, one valid expression could be: \n7 - 3 = 4, \n10 - 4 = 6, \n4 * 6 = 24.\n\nLet's form the expression directly: \n(7 - 3) * (10 - 4).\n\nSo, the expression is: (7 - 3) * (10 - 4).\n\n<answer>(7 - 3) * (10 - 4)</answer>",

We have three 3s and one 8, and we can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nOne approach is to try and get close to 24 by using the larger number, 8, as a base. If we multiply 8 by 3, we get 24. However, this uses only one 3, and we have two more 3s to incorporate.\n\nLet's examine the expression: 8 * 3. This equals 24, but we've used only one 3. We need to incorporate the other two 3s.\n\nOne possible expression is: 8 * (3 - (3 / 3)). Let's simplify this:\n- First, divide 3 by 3: 3 / 3 = 1.\n- Then, subtract 1 from 3: 3 - 1 = 2.\n- Finally, multiply 8 by 2: 8 * 2 = 16. This doesn't equal 24.\n\nLet's think of another combination. What if we try to adjust our numbers to get to 24? We can achieve this with: 3 * 8.\n\nNow, let's think about using the remaining two 3s to adjust this. We can form the expression: 3 * 8 + (3 - 3). However, (3 - 3) equals 0, so this simplifies to just 3 * 8, which is 24. But again, this doesn't utilize the fact that we need to use all numbers in a meaningful way since (3 - 3) results in 0.\n\nLet's directly form 24: One of the valid expressions is 8 * 3. To incorporate the other 3s, we can use them in a way that doesn't change the value. However, a straightforward expression that works is: (3 + 3 / 3) * 8 or simply using the numbers in a different arrangement.\n\nLet's directly evaluate a simple expression: 8 / (3 - (8 / 3)) is not valid since it reuses 8.\n\nA valid expression is: 3 * 8 * (3 / 3) or simply 8 * 3. Let's directly form a valid expression.\n\nOne valid expression is: 8 * (3 - (3 / 3)) doesn't work as shown before.\n\nLet's directly check a simple and straightforward expression: 3*3*8/3.\n\nSo, a valid expression can be formed as: 3 * 8 + 3 - 3 or more simply as 8*3.\n\nLet's simplify to a correct format: The expression can be 3*8.\n\nTo utilize all numbers and operators effectively, we can form: 8*3*3/3.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>8*3*3/3</answer>",

We have two 2s, which suggests we could either add them together or multiply them. However, since we can only use each number once, we actually have to use the numbers 8, 5, and the two 2s in a way that gets us to 24.\n\nOne possible way to get to 24 is by using multiplication and addition/subtraction. Let's start by looking at the larger numbers first and then adjusting with the smaller ones.\n\nUsing 8 as a base (since it's the largest number), we can think of getting to 24 by multiplying 8 by 3. To get 3, we can use 5 - 2 = 3. So, we have 8 * (5 - 2).\n\nNow, let's incorporate the remaining numbers. We have used 5, 2, and 8. The last number is 2. So, the expression becomes 8 * (5 - 2) = 8 * 3 = 24. But we need to incorporate the second 2 into our calculation.\n\nLet's directly form the expression: We can achieve this by doing 8*(5-2/1).

So, 8 * 4 = 32, which is too high.\n\nLet's think of another combination: Using the numbers to directly form 24 or get close to it. \n\nOne way to achieve 24 is by doing (8 + 2 + 2 + 5 + ?) or (8 * ? - ?). However, we can't directly achieve this with the given numbers and operators without exceeding the usage limit of numbers.\n\nAnother possible expression is 8 + 5 * 2 + 2 (using the numbers and operators given). Let's form this: 5 * 2 = 10, 10 + 8 = 18, 18 + 2 = 20, which is less than 24.\n\nHowever, if we adjust our strategy: (8 - 5) * (2 + 2) doesn't work because it equals 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nLet's directly form a valid expression: 5*2 = 10, 8 + 10 = 18 (still short), and adding 2 more gives 20. But if we do 8 - 5 + 2*2 (or a variation), it doesn't directly give 24.\n\nAfter some thought, a valid expression is: 8 + 5 + 2 * (some operation) or a variation. But a straightforward expression is 5 + 2*8 + 2 (not valid because it exceeds the target or doesn't directly achieve 24).\n\nHowever, one valid expression is: (8 / 2) * (5 + 2 - 1 is not possible because we can't use 1). Let's directly form: (8 / 2) * (2 + 5 - ?) is not valid. But, 8 / 2 = 4, and 4 * (some operation) could work.\n\nLet's directly check a valid combination: 8 * 2 + 5 + ? or variations. \n\nOne valid expression is: 5 - 2 = 3, and 8 * 3 = 24. So, 8 * (5 - 2).\n\nTo incorporate the second 2 into a valid equation, we can do: 8 * (5 - (2/2)).\n\nLet's simplify: 2/2 = 1, 5 - 1 = 4, and 8 * 4.\n\nThe expression becomes: 8 * (5 - 2/2)\n\n<answer>8*(5-2/2)</answer>",

Multiplication seems promising because 24 is a relatively large number compared to the given numbers.\n2. We can achieve 24 by using multiplication or a combination of operations that result in a product or sum that equals 24.\n\nLet's try different combinations:\n- Using 8 as a base since it's the largest number: \\(8 \\times (some operation) = 24\\) or \\(8 + (some operation) = 24\\).\n- \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\), so if we can make 3 using the remaining numbers (5, 2, 2), it could work. We can achieve 3 by doing \\(5 - 2 = 3\\), which leaves us with one 2 unused. However, we can adjust our strategy: \\(8 + (some operation) = 24\\) implies \\((some operation) = 16\\), which is not straightforward with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's directly form 24:\n- \\(5 + 2 = 7\\) and \\(8 - 2 = 6\\), then \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\) (too high) or \\(8 + 2 = 10\\) and \\(5 + 2 = 7\\), then \\(10 + 7 + 8 = 25\\) (still too high and uses numbers more than once).\n- A straightforward way is to directly achieve 24: \\(8 * (5 - 2/2)\\) or a similar combination.\n\nLet's directly calculate:\n\\(5 - 2 = 3\\) and \\(8 * 3 = 24\\), so \\(8 * (5 - 2) = 24\\). This uses one 2, and we're left with another 2 unused. However, we can directly form this expression: \\(8 * (5 - 2/1)\\) is not valid since it uses one number more than once or implies division by 1 which is not directly available.\n\nThe expression that works is: \\(8*(5-2/2)\\) is not valid because it implies using 2 twice in a division operation.\n\nLet's simplify:\nUsing the available numbers directly in a simple expression: \\(8 * (2 + (5-2))\\) or similar.

So, 8 * 3 = 24. Now, we need to incorporate the remaining numbers (3 and 2) into the expression in a way that still equals 24.\n\nOne possible expression is: 8 * (3 * (3 - 2)) or simplified versions. Let's simplify this thought:\n- If we do 3 - 2, we get 1.\n- Then, 3 * 1 = 3.\n- And 8 * 3 = 24.\n\nSo, the expression can be written as: 8 * 3 * (3 - 2).\n\nLet's simplify it further into a valid expression: 3 * 8 * (3 - 2) or 8 * (3 - 2) * 3.\n\nLet's write it out: 3*8*(3-2)\n\n<answer>3*8*(3-2)</answer>",
