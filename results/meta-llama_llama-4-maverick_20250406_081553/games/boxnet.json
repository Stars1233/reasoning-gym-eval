      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_blue', 'target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

The agent at `[1.5, 1.5]` can move `box_red` to `[0.5, 1.5]`.\n2. `box_blue` is at `[1.5, 2.5]` and `target_blue` is at `[0.5, 0.5]`. The agent at `[1.5, 2.5]` can move `box_blue` to `[0.5, 2.5]` and then potentially to `[0.5, 0.5]` or directly to `[0.5, 0.5]` if possible, but since it's not directly possible, it needs to be moved step by step.\n3. `box_green` is at `[2.5, 1.5]` and `target_green` is at `[0.5, 0.5]`. The agent at `[2.5, 1.5]` can move `box_green` to `[1.5, 1.5]` and then potentially to `[0.5, 0.5]` or directly if an agent is available at `[0.5, 0.5]`.\n\n### Step 3: Create the Action Plan\n\nGiven the priorities and the rules, let's create the action plan.\n\n1. Move `box_red` to `target_red`:\n   - Agent at `[1.5, 1.5]` moves `box_red` to `[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\n2. Move `box_blue` towards `target_blue`:\n   - Agent at `[1.5, 2.5]` moves `box_blue` to `[0.5, 2.5]`.\n   - Then, the agent at `[0.5, 2.5]` moves `box_blue` to `[0.5, 1.5]` and then to `[0.5, 0.5]`.\n\n3. Move `box_green` towards `target_green`:\n   - Agent at `[2.5, 1.5]` moves `box_green` to `[1.5, 1.5]`.\n   - The agent that will be available at `[1.5, 1.5]` (after moving `box_red`) can then move `box_green` to `[0.5, 1.5]` and then to `[0.5, 0.5]`.\n\nLet's format this into the required JSON action plan format.\n\n### Step 4: Format the Action Plan\n\n1. First step:\n   - Agent at `[1.5, 1.5]` moves `box_red` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n   - Agent at `[1.5, 2.5]` moves `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 2.5]`.\n   - Agent at `[2.5, 1.5]` moves `box_green` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n\n2. Subsequent steps will be planned based on the outcome of the previous step.\n\nLet's create the first few steps of the action plan:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHowever, the exact sequence might need adjustments based on the precise rules of movement and conflict resolution. The above plan assumes that agents can move boxes in the described manner without conflicts.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n```",

This is a direct match, so it's the priority action.\n   - `Agent[1.5, 2.5]` can move `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 2.5]`, and then it can be moved to `target_blue` at `square[0.5, 0.5]`. The first step is to move it to `square[0.5, 2.5]`.\n   - `Agent[2.5, 1.5]` can move `box_green` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`, and then it needs to be moved towards `target_green` at `square[0.5, 0.5]`. The first step is to move it to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n\n4. **First Step Action Plan**:\n   - `Agent[1.5, 1.5]`: move `box_red` to `target_red` at `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n   - `Agent[1.5, 2.5]`: move `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 2.5]`.\n   - `Agent[2.5, 1.5]`: move `box_green` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n\nLet's format this into the required JSON format for the first step:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAfter the first step, we need to continue planning.\n\n- After moving `box_red` to `target_red`, `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` is now free.\n- `box_blue` is at `square[0.5, 2.5]`, so `Agent[0.5, 2.5]` can move it to `target_blue` at `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n- `box_green` is at `square[1.5, 1.5]`, so `Agent[1.5, 1.5]` can move it towards `target_green`.\n\nContinuing this process:\n\n2nd Step:\n- `Agent[0.5, 2.5]`: move `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n- `Agent[1.5, 1.5]`: move `box_green` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n3rd Step:\n- `box_green` is at `square[0.5, 1.5]`, so it needs to be moved to `target_green` at `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n- `Agent[0.5, 1.5]`: move `box_green` to `target_green`.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]).

It can move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5] or square[2.5, 1.5]. Since 'target_red' is at square[1.5, 1.5], moving 'box_red' to square[2.5, 1.5] doesn't directly help, but moving it to square[1.5, 0.5] puts it closer to 'target_red'.\n\n### Step 1 Action Plan\n\nGiven the observations and possible moves, the action plan should prioritize matching boxes to targets or moving them closer to their targets.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### After Step 1\n\n1. **Agent[1.5, 0.5]**: Now in square[1.5, 1.5], has 'box_blue'.\n2. **Agent[1.5, 1.5]**: Now empty.\n3. **Agent[2.5, 1.5]**: Now has 'box_green'.\n4. **Agent[1.5, 0.5]**: Now has 'box_red'.\n\nLet's continue.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze New State\n\n- **Agent[1.5, 1.5]** is now empty and observes 'target_red' and previously had 'box_blue'.

We need to move 'box_red' towards 'target_red'.\n   - 'box_green' is with Agent[1.5, 1.5] and 'target_green' is with Agent[2.5, 0.5]. We can move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n   - 'box_blue' is with Agent[1.5, 0.5] and 'target_blue' is with Agent[2.5, 0.5]. We can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n\nLet's plan the actions step by step, following the rules:\n\n### Step 1:\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green' at square[2.5, 0.5]. Action: \"move(box_green, target_green)\".\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] moves 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5] to get closer to 'target_red'. Action: \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\".\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' at square[2.5, 0.5]. However, since 'target_blue' is occupied by 'target_green' and 'box_green' is being moved there, we should reconsider. Instead, we can move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5] or directly to 'target_blue' if it were possible. Let's move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5].

Since 'target_red' is at square[1.5, 1.5], Agent[1.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to 'target_red'. Action: \"move(box_red, target_red)\".\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] now has 'box_blue' and can move it to 'target_blue'. However, 'target_blue' is at square[2.5, 0.5]. Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' to square[2.5, 1.5] to get closer. Action: \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])\".\n\nAction Plan Continued:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3:\n- Agent[2.5, 1.5] can now move 'box_blue' from square[2.5, 1.5] to 'target_blue' at square[2.5, 0.5].

Since 'box_blue' is not at a target and there's no 'target_blue' in its observable area, it should move 'box_blue' towards a potential 'target_blue'. The closest move would be to square[0.5, 0.5] where there's an agent, or to square[1.5, 1.5] where another agent is.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_blue', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\n\n",

Can move `box_blue` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`, `square[0.5, 0.5]`, or `target_blue`.\n3. **Agent[1.5, 0.5]**: Can't observe or do anything.\n4. **Agent[1.5, 1.5]**: Observes `box_green`. Can move `box_green` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`, `square[2.5, 1.5]`, or `square[1.5, 0.5]`.\n5. **Agent[2.5, 0.5]**: Observes `box_red`.

Can't do anything.\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Actions Based on the Rules\n\n1. **Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets**: \n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] can move `box_red` to `target_red` if it were in the adjacent square, but `target_red` is observed by Agent[0.5, 1.5]. However, Agent[2.5, 0.5] can move `box_red` to `square[1.5, 0.5]`, bringing it closer to `target_red`.\n\n2. **Plan Actions**:\n   - For Agent[0.5, 1.5], moving `box_blue` to `target_blue` is a direct match.\n   - For Agent[1.5, 1.5], moving `box_green` towards `target_green` is a good step. Moving it to `square[2.5, 1.5]` brings it closer to `target_green`.\n   - For Agent[2.5, 0.5], moving `box_red` to `square[1.5, 0.5]` is a step towards `target_red`.\n\n### Step 3: Create the Action Plan\n\nLet's create the first step of the action plan based on the prioritization:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAfter this step, we need to re-evaluate the state.\n\n- `box_blue` is matched.\n- `box_green` is now in `square[2.5, 1.5]`, and Agent[2.5, 1.5] can potentially move it to `target_green`.\n- `box_red` is now in `square[1.5, 0.5]`, and Agent[1.5, 0.5] can potentially move it to `target_red`.\n\n### Step 4: Continue Planning\n\nLet's continue with the next steps:\n\n1. **Agent[2.5, 1.5]** can now move `box_green` from `square[2.5, 1.5]` to `target_green`.\n2. **Agent[1.5, 0.5]** can move `box_red` from `square[1.5, 0.5]` to `target_red`.\n\nSo, the next action plan could be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Combining the Steps\n\nThe complete action plan so far is:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis plan efficiently matches all boxes to their targets in two steps.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n```",

Agent[2.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to 'square[1.5, 0.5]'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] can directly move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' towards 'target_green' at 'square[2.5, 1.5]' by moving it to 'square[2.5, 1.5]'.\n   \n   The first action plan can be represented as:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"}]\n   ```\n\n4. **Subsequent Action Plans**:\n   - After the first action, 'box_blue' is matched, 'box_red' is at 'square[1.5, 0.5]', and 'box_green' is at 'square[2.5, 1.5]'.\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] can now move 'box_red' from 'square[1.5, 0.5]' to 'target_red' at 'square[0.5, 1.5]'.\n   - Agent[2.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' from 'square[2.5, 1.5]' to 'target_green'.\n   \n   The subsequent action plan can be:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}]\n   ```\n\n5. **Combining Action Plans**:\n   The overall action plan is a list of these action dictionaries.\n\nLet's put it all together:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])']\n\n",

Can move `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\n### Step 2: Plan the Actions\n\n#### Step 1: Move `box_green` to `square[0.5, 1.5]` and `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\n- `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` can move `box_green` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n- `Agent[0.5, 2.5]` can move `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\nAfter this step, `square[0.5, 1.5]` will contain `box_green` and `box_blue`. `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can now potentially move these boxes to their respective targets.\n\n#### Step 2: Move `box_blue` and `box_green` to their respective targets.\n\nAssuming `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can now act:\n- Move `box_blue` to `target_blue` (not directly observable, but let's assume it's nearby or the target is at `square[0.5, 1.5]`).\n- Move `box_green` to `target_green`.\n\nHowever, we need to check the feasibility based on the information given and adjust our plan.\n\n### Step 3: Create the Action Plan\n\nLet's start with the first step based on the information given:\n\n1. `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` moves `box_green` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n2. `Agent[0.5, 2.5]` moves `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAfter this step, we need to assess the new situation:\n- `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` is now in a position to act on `box_blue` and `box_green`.\n\nLet's assume after the first step, `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can observe and act on the boxes:\n- It can move `box_green` to `target_green`.\n- It can move `box_blue` to `target_blue` if it's observable and nearby.\n\n### Step 4: Continue the Action Plan\n\nFor the second step:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\" \n  }\n]\n```\nHowever, we need to correct the second step because an agent can't perform two actions at once. Let's correct the plan:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 0.5]: I am in square[3.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 1.5]: I am in square[3.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[3.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[3.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[3.5, 2.5]: I am in square[3.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

Now, both `box_green` and `box_blue` are in `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n3. **Move `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`**: Since `target_blue` is in `square[0.5, 1.5]`, Agent[1.5, 1.5] (if it moves to `square[1.5, 1.5]`) or another nearby agent can move `box_blue` to `target_blue`. However, we first need to get an agent to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n4. **Move `box_red` to `square[1.5, 1.5]` or directly to `target_red` if possible**: Agent[3.5, 1.5] can move `box_red` to `square[2.5, 1.5]` and then to `square[1.5, 1.5]`, or find a more direct path to `target_red` in `square[1.5, 0.5]`.\n5. **Direct `box_blue` to `target_blue`**: Once `box_blue` is in an adjacent square to `target_blue`, it can be moved directly to `target_blue`.\n6. **Direct `box_red` to `target_red`**: Once `box_red` is in `square[1.5, 0.5]` or adjacent to it, it can be moved to `target_red`.\n7. **Direct `box_green` to `target_green`**: After `box_green` is in a suitable position, it can be moved to `target_green`.\n\n### Step 3: Create the Action Plan\n\nLet's create a step-by-step action plan based on the above steps:\n\n1. **Step 1**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves `box_green` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5] moves `box_blue` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}`\n\n2. **Step 2**:\n   - Agent[3.5, 1.5] moves `box_red` to `square[2.5, 1.5]`.\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])\"}`\n\n3. **Step 3**:\n   - Agent[2.5, 1.5] (if it were there) or Agent[1.5, 1.5] (if it moves to `square[1.5, 1.5]`) moves `box_red` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`. However, we need to adjust our plan as there's no agent in `square[2.5, 1.5]` or `square[1.5, 1.5]`. Let's correct this: Agent[2.5, 1.5] is empty, so it can move to `square[2.5, 1.5]` and then move `box_red` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n   - Action Plan: First, move Agent[2.5, 1.5] to `square[2.5, 1.5]` is not needed as it's already considered to be there for the sake of action. So, `{\"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}`.\n\n4. **Step 4**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] (now in `square[1.5, 1.5]`) moves `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}` directly if possible.\n\n5. **Step 5**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves `box_red` to `target_red`.\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}`.\n\n6. **Step 6**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves `box_green` to `target_green`.\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}`.\n\nLet's simplify and correct the action plan into a JSON format list:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nHowever, the exact sequence might need adjustments based on the exact rules of agent movement and box handling. The provided sequence assumes certain capabilities and movements that might not be directly supported by the given problem constraints.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n```",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 3.5]: I am in square[1.5, 3.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\n\n",

The closest 'target_blue' is in square[1.5, 3.5], so it should move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 3.5].\n\n3. **First Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 3.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to square[1.5, 2.5].\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 3.5].\n\nLet's format this into the required JSON format for the first step:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAfter the first step:\n\n- Agent[0.5, 3.5] has completed its task.\n- Agent[1.5, 2.5] is now in square[1.5, 2.5] and can observe that 'box_green' is now in the same square as 'target_green'. It can move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n- Agent[1.5, 3.5] is now in square[1.5, 3.5] with 'box_blue' and 'target_blue'. It can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n\n4. **Second Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n   - Agent[1.5, 3.5] moves 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n\nLet's format this into the required JSON format for the second step:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nSince all boxes are matched to their targets after the second step, we have achieved our objective.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'target_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and create a sequence of action plans that will match all boxes to their color-coded targets efficiently.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\n\nFrom the given information, we can observe the following:\n- `Agent[0.5, 0.5]`: No boxes or targets.\n- `Agent[0.5, 1.5]`: Has `box_blue`, `box_green`, and `target_blue`.\n- `Agent[1.5, 0.5]`: Has `box_red` and `target_green`.\n- `Agent[1.5, 1.5]`: Has `target_red`.\n- `Agent[2.5, 0.5]` and `Agent[2.5, 1.5]`: No boxes or targets.\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Actions\n\n1. `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can move `box_blue` to `target_blue` directly because it is in the same square.\n2. `Agent[1.5, 0.5]` has `box_red` and can move it to `target_red` in `square[1.5, 1.5]`. It needs to move `box_red` to `square[1.5, 1.5]` first.\n3. `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` also has `box_green` but there's no `target_green` in its observable area. It has `target_green` in its observable actions to move `box_green` to `square[1.5, 1.5]` (where `Agent[1.5, 0.5]` is not, initially), but actually, it can move `box_green` to `square[0.5, 0.5]` or `square[1.5, 1.5]`. Since `target_green` is in `square[1.5, 0.5]`, moving `box_green` to `square[1.5, 1.5]` is a good initial step.\n\n### Step 3: Create the Action Plan\n\n1. **Step 1**:\n   - `Agent[0.5, 1.5]`: Move `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n   - `Agent[1.5, 0.5]`: Move `box_red` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n   \n   Action Plan: `[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}]`\n\n2. **Step 2**:\n   - `Agent[1.5, 1.5]`: Move `box_red` to `target_red`.\n   - `Agent[0.5, 1.5]`: Move `box_green` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n\n   However, since `Agent[1.5, 1.5]` is now in possession of `box_red` (from Step 1), it should move `box_red` to `target_red`. And `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can move `box_green` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n\n   Action Plan for Step 2: `[{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}]`\n\n3. **Step 3**:\n   - `Agent[1.5, 0.5]`: Move `box_green` to `target_green`.\n\n   Action Plan for Step 3: `[{\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}]`\n\n### Step 4: Compile the Action Plans\n\nThe sequence of action plans is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n</answer> \n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and create a sequence of action plans that will match all boxes to their color-coded targets efficiently.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\n\nFrom the given information, we can observe the following:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] is empty and has no actions.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] has 'box_blue', 'box_green', and 'target_blue'. It can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue', 'square[1.5, 1.5]', or 'square[0.5, 0.5]', and 'box_green' to 'square[1.5, 1.5]' or 'square[0.5, 0.5]'.\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] has 'box_red' and 'target_green'. It can move 'box_red' to 'square[0.5, 0.5]', 'square[2.5, 0.5]', or 'square[1.5, 1.5]'.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] has 'target_red' but is currently doing nothing.\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] and Agent[2.5, 1.5] are empty and have no actions.\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Actions\n\nFirst, prioritize actions that match boxes to their targets:\n1. Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n2. Agent[1.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to 'target_red' if it moves to 'square[1.5, 1.5]' first.\n\n### Step 3: Create the Action Plan\n\nLet's start with the initial actions:\n1. Agent[0.5, 1.5] should move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n2. Agent[1.5, 0.5] should move 'box_red' to 'square[1.5, 1.5]' to get closer to 'target_red'.\n\nThe first action plan will be:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Continue the Action Plan\n\nAfter the first step:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] has 'box_green'. It can move 'box_green' to 'square[1.5, 1.5]' or 'square[0.5, 0.5]'.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] has 'box_red'. It can move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] is now in 'square[1.5, 0.5]' and can observe 'target_green'. It can potentially move to 'target_green' if it had 'box_green'.\n\nThe next action plan:\n1. Agent[1.5, 1.5] should move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5] should move 'box_green' to 'square[1.5, 1.5]'.\n\nHowever, since Agent[1.5, 1.5] now has 'box_red', it should act. Also, Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' to 'square[1.5, 1.5]' or directly to 'target_green' if possible, but 'target_green' is in 'square[1.5, 0.5]'.\n\nLet's correct the sequence:\n1. Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to 'square[1.5, 0.5]'.\n\nThe second action plan will be:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Finalize the Action Plan\n\nAfter the second step:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] can move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\nThe final action plan:\n1. Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\nThe third action plan will be:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 6: Compile the Action Plans\n\nCompiling all the action plans into a single list:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n```",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])']\n\n",

Agent[0.5, 0.5] is empty and can move to square[0.5, 1.5] to help.\n     - Agent[0.5, 0.5] can now directly move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n     - Agent[1.5, 1.5] has 'box_red' and 'target_red', so 'box_red' is matched.\n     - Agent[1.5, 2.5] can move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5].\n\n   - **Action Plan for Step 2**:\n     ```json\n     {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 3**:\n     - Agent[1.5, 1.5] now has 'box_blue'.

          "full_model_response": "To create an efficient action plan, we need to analyze the given information and prioritize actions based on the rules provided.\n\n1. **Current State Analysis**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] is in square[0.5, 0.5] with 'box_green' and can move it to square[1.5, 0.5] or square[0.5, 1.5].\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] is in square[0.5, 1.5] with 'target_green' and has no actions.\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] is empty and has no actions.\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] is in square[1.5, 0.5] with 'target_blue' and has no actions.\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] is in square[1.5, 1.5] with 'target_red' and has no actions.\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5] is in square[1.5, 2.5] with 'box_red' and 'box_blue' and can move either to adjacent squares.\n\n2. **Prioritizing Actions**:\n   - Since Agent[0.5, 1.5] has 'target_green', we should prioritize moving 'box_green' towards it. The most direct way is to move 'box_green' from square[0.5, 0.5] to square[0.5, 1.5].\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5] has 'box_red' and 'box_blue'. 'box_red' can be moved to 'target_red' in square[1.5, 1.5], which is a direct match. 'box_blue' can be moved towards 'target_blue' in square[1.5, 0.5], but it's not a direct match in one step.\n\n3. **First Action Plan**:\n   - Move 'box_green' from square[0.5, 0.5] to square[0.5, 1.5].\n   - Move 'box_red' from square[1.5, 2.5] to square[1.5, 1.5] to match it with 'target_red'.\n\nThe first action plan in JSON format:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}]\n```\n\n4. **Subsequent Action Plans**:\n   - After the first action, 'box_green' is in square[0.5, 1.5]. Since Agent[0.5, 1.5] is already on 'target_green', 'box_green' can be directly moved to 'target_green'.\n   - 'box_blue' is still with Agent[1.5, 2.5]. It can be moved to square[1.5, 1.5] or square[0.5, 2.5]. Since 'target_blue' is in square[1.5, 0.5], moving 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5] is a step towards it, but we should directly aim to move it to square[1.5, 0.5] if possible, or find a clear path.\n\nLet's analyze the next steps:\n- 'box_green' is now in square[0.5, 1.5]. Agent[0.5, 1.5] can take the action to move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n- 'box_red' is moved to square[1.5, 1.5]. Since 'target_red' is in the same square, Agent[1.5, 1.5] or Agent[1.5, 2.5] can potentially match it, but since 'box_red' is already on 'target_red', no further action is needed for 'box_red'.\n- 'box_blue' needs to be moved towards 'target_blue'. The next step is to move 'box_blue' from square[1.5, 2.5] to square[1.5, 1.5] (though this square now contains 'box_red' on 'target_red', our action plan should avoid conflicts), so a better action is to move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n\nSecond Action Plan:\n- Move 'box_green' to 'target_green' using Agent[0.5, 1.5].\n- Move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}]\n```\n\n5. **Continuing the Action Plans**:\n- After 'box_green' is matched, Agent[0.5, 2.5] (now potentially having 'box_blue') can move 'box_blue' towards 'target_blue'. \n- 'box_blue' is now in square[0.5, 2.5]. Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move it to square[0.5, 1.5] or directly try to get it closer to 'target_blue'.\n\nLet's continue:\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 2.5] (back to its original position, not ideal) or to square[0.5, 1.5]. Since square[0.5, 1.5] is now 'target_green', we should avoid that. So, a viable next step is to move 'box_blue' from square[0.5, 2.5] to square[1.5, 2.5].\n\nThird Action Plan:\n- Move 'box_blue' from square[0.5, 2.5] to square[1.5, 2.5].\n\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"}]\n```\n\nAfter this, 'box_blue' is back in square[1.5, 2.5]. Agent[1.5, 2.5] can now move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5] and then to square[1.5, 0.5] where 'target_blue' is.\n\nFourth Action Plan:\n- Move 'box_blue' from square[1.5, 2.5] to square[1.5, 1.5].\n- Then, move 'box_blue' from square[1.5, 1.5] to 'target_blue' in square[1.5, 0.5].\n\n```json\n[{\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}, {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}]\n```\n\nLet's compile the action plans into a list as required:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_red', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\n\n",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'box_blue', 'box_green', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, target_green)']\n\n",

The most efficient first step is to directly move `box_green` to `target_green` because it is a direct match and follows the rule of prioritizing matching boxes to targets.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process for the initial steps:\n\n1. **Step 1**: `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can move `box_green` to `target_green`. So, the action is `\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"`. `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` has no action as it cannot perform any.\n\n2. After Step 1, the state changes. `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` now observes `['box_red', 'box_blue']` (assuming `box_green` and `target_green` are no longer observable after the move), and potentially can move `box_red` or `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n\n3. **Step 2**: `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can move `box_red` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`. So, a potential action is `\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"`. Then, `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` can potentially move `box_red` to `target_red` if it can interact with `box_red` after it is moved to its square.\n\nLet's formulate the initial action plans based on this analysis.\n\n### Step 1 Action Plan\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 2 Action Plan (Predicted State After Step 1)\nAfter `box_green` is moved to `target_green`, `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can move `box_red` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3 Action Plan (Predicted State After Step 2)\nNow, assuming `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` can interact with `box_red` in its square and move it to `target_red`, and `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` moves `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4 Action Plan (Predicted State After Step 3)\n`Agent[0.5, 0.5]` can now move `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nLet's combine these steps into a single list of action plans.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n```",

It has no boxes to move.\n   - `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` is in `square[0.5, 1.5]`, observes `['box_red', 'box_blue', 'box_green', 'target_green']`, and can perform actions like moving `box_red`, `box_blue`, or `box_green` to `square[0.5, 0.5]` or moving `box_green` directly to `target_green`.\n\n2. **Prioritizing Actions**:\n   - Since `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can observe `target_green` and `box_green`, and it can directly move `box_green` to `target_green`, this action should be prioritized as it matches a box to its target.\n\n3. **First Action Plan**:\n   - `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` should move `box_green` to `target_green`. So, the action is `\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"`.\n   - `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` has no action as it cannot observe any boxes.\n\n4. **State After First Action**:\n   - `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` is still in `square[0.5, 0.5]` and observes `['target_red', 'target_blue', 'box_red', 'box_blue']` because `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` has moved the boxes to this square.\n   - `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` is now in `square[0.5, 1.5]` and observes `['target_green']`.

It can move `box_red` to `target_red` and `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n   - However, according to the rules, we can only assign one action per agent at a time. So, we should prioritize one action.\n\n6. **Second Action Plan**:\n   - Let's prioritize moving `box_red` to `target_red`: `\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"`.\n\n7. **State After Second Action**:\n   - `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` observes `['target_blue', 'box_blue']`.\n   - It can now move `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n\n8. **Third Action Plan**:\n   - `\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"`.\n\nLet's format these actions according to the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

The most efficient first step is to directly move `box_green` to `target_green` because it is a direct match and follows the rule of prioritizing matching boxes to targets.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process for the initial steps:\n\n1. **Step 1**: `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can move `box_green` to `target_green`. So, the action is `\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"`. `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` has no action as it cannot perform any.\n\n2. After Step 1, the state changes. `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` now observes `['box_red', 'box_blue']` (assuming `box_green` and `target_green` are no longer observable after the move), and potentially can move `box_red` or `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n\n3. **Step 2**: `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can move `box_red` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`. So, a potential action is `\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"`. Then, `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` can potentially move `box_red` to `target_red` if it can interact with `box_red` after it is moved to its square.\n\nLet's formulate the initial action plans based on this analysis.\n\n### Step 1 Action Plan\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 2 Action Plan (Predicted State After Step 1)\nAfter `box_green` is moved to `target_green`, `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` can move `box_red` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3 Action Plan (Predicted State After Step 2)\nNow, assuming `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` can interact with `box_red` in its square and move it to `target_red`, and `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` moves `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4 Action Plan (Predicted State After Step 3)\n`Agent[0.5, 0.5]` can now move `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nLet's combine these steps into a single list of action plans.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n```",

According to rule 3, we should prioritize matching boxes to their targets. Thus, moving 'box_green' to 'target_green' is the highest priority action for Agent[0.5, 1.5].\n\n3. **First Action Plan**:\n   - Since Agent[0.5, 1.5] can directly move 'box_green' to 'target_green', the first action is: `move(box_green, target_green)`.\n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] has no boxes to move, so it is not included in the action plan.\n\nThe first action plan in JSON format is:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}]\n```\n\nAfter this action, 'box_green' will be at 'target_green', and the state will change.

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]).

Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3.

Agent[0.5, 0.5]: Can observe `box_blue`, can move `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5]: Can observe `target_red`, `target_blue`, `box_green`, can move `box_green` to `square[0.5, 0.5]` or `square[0.5, 2.5]`.\n3. Agent[0.5, 2.5]: Can observe `box_red`, `target_green`, can move `box_red` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Actions Based on Rules\n\nFirst, we prioritize actions that match boxes to their targets. Currently, no agent can directly move a box to its corresponding target.\n\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`, which is a step towards potentially getting it to `target_blue` if it's there.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move `box_green` to either `square[0.5, 0.5]` or `square[0.5, 2.5]`. Moving it to `square[0.5, 2.5]` brings it closer to `target_green`.\n3. Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move `box_red` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`, which is a step towards getting it to `target_red`.\n\n### Step 3: Create the First Action Plan\n\nBased on the observations:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves `box_green` to `square[0.5, 2.5]` because it brings `box_green` closer to `target_green`.\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves `box_red` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\nThe first action plan is:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \n  \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\", \n  \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the State After the First Action\n\nAfter the first actions:\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5] is empty.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5] has `box_blue` and `box_red`, and observes `target_red`, `target_blue`, `box_green` (now in [0.5, 2.5]).\n3. Agent[0.5, 2.5] has `box_green` and observes `box_red` (now in [0.5, 1.5]), `target_green`.\n\nThe possible actions:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move `box_red` to `target_red` directly.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move `box_blue` to `target_blue` directly.\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move `box_green` to `target_green` directly.\n\n### Step 5: Create the Subsequent Action Plans\n\n1. Move `box_red` to `target_red` and `box_blue` to `target_blue`:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \n  \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}]\n```\n\nSince `box_blue` is also at `square[0.5, 1.5]` and can be moved to `target_blue`, we adjust our plan to reflect that `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` should move `box_blue` to `target_blue` after moving `box_red` to `target_red` is not possible in the same step due to the single action per agent rule.\n\nCorrected subsequent steps:\n1. `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` moves `box_red` to `target_red`.\n2. Then, `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` moves `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n3. `Agent[0.5, 2.5]` moves `box_green` to `target_green`.\n\nSo, the sequence should be:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \n   \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\", \n   \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \n   \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \n   \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\", \n   \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \n   \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'target_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)']\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])']\n\n",

Now:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5].\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] is now free and can potentially move 'box_red' or 'box_green' to their respective targets if they were in its square.\n\n### State After Step 1:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] is in square[0.5, 0.5] with 'box_red'.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] is in square[0.5, 1.5] with 'box_green' and 'box_red' (after Step 2's first action).\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] is in square[0.5, 2.5].\n\nLet's continue:\n\n### Action Plan for Step 2:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5].\n\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 3:\n- Now, Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n- And then, it can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 2.5] and then to 'target_red'.\n\n### Action Plan for Step 3:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 4:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 5:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}]\n```\n\nHowever, in Step 4 and Step 5, the actions can be optimized by having Agent[0.5, 1.5] move 'box_red' directly to 'target_red' in one step if it's possible, or ensuring the correct agent moves it.\n\nLet's directly provide the sequence of action plans as per the given instructions:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

So, Agent[0.5, 0.5] should move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5].\n   - 'box_green' is in square[0.5, 2.5] and can be moved to square[0.5, 1.5] by Agent[0.5, 2.5].\n\n4. **First Step Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5].\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves 'box_green' to square[0.5, 1.5].\n\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"}]\n   ```\n\n5. **After First Step**:\n   - 'box_blue' is matched.\n   - 'box_red' and 'box_green' are in square[0.5, 1.5].\n\n6. **Next Steps**:\n   - Since 'box_red' and 'box_green' are in the same square, we need to decide how to proceed without conflict.\n   - 'target_red' is in square[0.5, 2.5] and 'target_green' is in square[0.5, 1.5]. So, 'box_green' can be directly moved to 'target_green'.\n   - Then, 'box_red' can be moved to square[0.5, 2.5] and then to 'target_red'.\n\n7. **Second Step Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] is not needed as it has already moved 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5] in the previous step, so now it's Agent[0.5, 1.5] that will handle 'box_red'.\n\n   However, since 'box_red' and 'box_green' are now in the same square, and we've decided 'box_green' should be moved to 'target_green', let's directly plan the next steps.\n\n8. **Detailed Subsequent Steps**:\n   - After the first step, we have 'box_red' and 'box_green' in square[0.5, 1.5].\n   - Second step: Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n   - Then, Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n   - Finally, Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n\nLet's format the action plan accordingly.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and create a sequence of action plans that will efficiently match all boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\n\nWe have three agents with their current states as follows:\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5]: Can observe `box_red` and can move it to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5]: Can observe `box_blue` and `target_blue`, and `target_green`. It can move `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`, `square[0.5, 2.5]`, or directly to `target_blue`.\n3. Agent[0.5, 2.5]: Can observe `target_red` and `box_green`. It can move `box_green` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Actions Based on the Rules\n\nFirst, we prioritize actions that directly match a box to its target.\n\n1. Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move `box_blue` directly to `target_blue`, which is a priority action.\n2. There's no direct match for `box_red` or `box_green` to their respective targets.\n\n### Step 3: Create the First Action Plan\n\nBased on the prioritization:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] should move `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move `box_red` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`, but this needs to be done carefully as Agent[0.5, 1.5] is acting. However, since they are moving different boxes, it's not conflicting.\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move `box_green` to `square[0.5, 1.5]`, but again, this needs coordination.\n\nThe first action plan could be:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the State After the First Action Plan\n\nAfter the first action plan:\n1. `box_blue` is matched to `target_blue`.\n2. `box_red` is moved to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n3. `box_green` is moved to `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\nNow, `square[0.5, 1.5]` contains `box_red` and `box_green`, and it's adjacent to `target_red`. The state of the agents and boxes will be:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5]: Idle, as it has completed its task.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5]: Now in `square[0.5, 1.5]` with `box_red` and `box_green`. It can move `box_red` to `target_red` or move `box_green` towards its target. Since `target_red` is at `square[0.5, 2.5]`, it can move `box_red` directly to `target_red`.\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5]: Now in `square[0.5, 2.5]` and idle, as `box_green` is moved.\n\n### Step 5: Create the Next Action Plan\n\n1. Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move `box_red` to `target_red` at `square[0.5, 2.5]`.\n2. There's no direct action for `box_green` as its target is not directly observable.\n\nThe next action plan:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 6: Analyze the State After the Second Action Plan\n\nAfter moving `box_red` to `target_red`:\n- `box_red` is matched.\n- `box_green` remains in `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n\n### Step 7: Continue Planning\n\nNow, Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move `box_green` to its target. However, `target_green` is at `square[0.5, 1.5]`, so it can directly move `box_green` to `target_blue` is not correct, it should be moved to `target_green` if it were in a different location, but since `target_green` is in the same square, it's a straightforward action.\n\nThe next action plan:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 8: Compile the Action Plans\n\nCompiling all action plans into a list:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6.

It can move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 1.5] or square[1.5, 0.5].\n\n2. **Prioritizing Actions**:\n   - We need to prioritize matching boxes to their targets.

However, the actual action will be taken by the agent that ends up with the box or is in the relevant square.\n     - 'box_blue' will be in square[1.5, 0.5] with 'target_blue', so it can be matched.\n     - 'box_green' will be in square[1.5, 1.5] with 'target_green', so it can be matched.\n   \n   Let's directly create the action plan based on the above steps.\n\n### Step 1 Action Plan:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n  \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n  \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2 Action Plan (after the moves in Step 1):\n- Assuming the moves are executed, the new state will be:\n  - Agent[0.5, 1.5] or nearby agent moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n  - Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n  - Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\nLet's assume the agents adjust their positions accordingly and directly match the boxes to targets.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n  \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n  \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final sequence of action plans will be:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'box_blue', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_green', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, target_green)']\n\n",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and create a sequence of action plans that will efficiently match all boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\n\nWe have four agents with their current states and possible actions:\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5] is in square[0.5, 0.5] with 'box_red' and 'box_blue'. It can move these boxes to adjacent squares or 'box_blue' directly to 'target_blue'.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5] is in square[0.5, 1.5] with 'target_red' but cannot perform any actions as there are no boxes to move.\n3. Agent[1.5, 0.5] is in square[1.5, 0.5] with no boxes or targets.\n4. Agent[1.5, 1.5] is in square[1.5, 1.5] with 'box_green' and 'target_green'. It can move 'box_green' to adjacent squares or directly to 'target_green'.\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Actions Based on the Rules\n\nFirst, prioritize actions that directly match a box to its target:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\n### Step 3: Create the First Action Plan\n\nBased on the prioritization:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAfter executing this plan:\n- 'box_blue' is matched with 'target_blue'.\n- 'box_green' is matched with 'target_green'.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the State After the First Action Plan\n\nAfter the first step:\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5] is left with 'box_red'.\n2. Agent[1.5, 1.5] has completed its task.\n\nThe new state is:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] can observe 'box_red' and can move it to adjacent squares.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] still cannot perform any action directly related to its observation ('target_red').\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] is still empty.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] has completed its task and won't be included in further plans as it has no more actions to perform.\n\n### Step 5: Plan the Next Steps\n\n1. Move 'box_red' to 'target_red'. The most efficient way is to move it to square[0.5, 1.5] first because 'target_red' is in square[0.5, 1.5].\n\n### Step 6: Create the Next Action Plan\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHowever, according to the rules, we should provide a list of action plans where each plan is a dictionary representing the actions for the agents at each step. So, we need to adjust our plans accordingly.\n\n### Step 7: Combine the Plans into a Single List\n\nFirst step:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n  \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n}\n```\n\nSecond step:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n}\n```\n\nThird step:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n}\n```\n\nSo, the complete action plan list is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n```",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and create a sequence of action plans that will match all boxes to their color-coded targets efficiently.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\n\nWe have four agents and their respective observations and possible actions:\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5] is in square[0.5, 0.5] with 'box_red', 'box_blue', and 'target_blue'. It can move 'box_red' or 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 0.5] or square[0.5, 1.5], or move 'box_blue' directly to 'target_blue'.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5] is in square[0.5, 1.5] with 'target_red' and can do nothing.\n3. Agent[1.5, 0.5] is in square[1.5, 0.5] with no boxes or targets and can do nothing.\n4. Agent[1.5, 1.5] is in square[1.5, 1.5] with 'box_green' and 'target_green'. It can move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 1.5], square[1.5, 0.5], or directly to 'target_green'.\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Actions\n\nFirst, we prioritize actions that match boxes directly to their targets:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\n### Step 3: Create the First Action Plan\n\nBased on the prioritization:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAfter executing this plan:\n- 'box_blue' is matched with 'target_blue'.\n- 'box_green' is matched with 'target_green'.\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] is left with 'box_red'.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] has completed its task.\n\n### Step 4: Plan Subsequent Actions\n\nNow, we have 'box_red' left to be matched with 'target_red'. The closest agent to 'target_red' is Agent[0.5, 0.5] with 'box_red'. Agent[0.5, 1.5] is already at 'target_red' but cannot move. So, we need to move 'box_red' to Agent[0.5, 1.5].\n\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5].\n\n### Step 5: Create the Next Action Plan\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAfter this step, 'box_red' is at square[0.5, 1.5].\n\n### Step 6: Finalize the Action Plan\n\nSince Agent[0.5, 1.5] cannot perform actions, we need to adjust our understanding. The correct sequence should directly utilize the available actions.\n\n1. The initial plan remains to move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' and 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n2. Then, move 'box_red' to 'target_red'. Since Agent[0.5, 1.5] is at 'target_red' and cannot act, we should directly consider moving 'box_red' towards 'target_red'. The most straightforward path is for Agent[0.5, 0.5] to move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5].\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we see that Agent[0.5, 1.5] is at 'target_red' but is unable to perform actions. The correct step involves Agent[0.5, 0.5] moving 'box_red' to Agent[0.5, 1.5], but since Agent[0.5, 1.5] cannot act, our plan should consider the available actions.\n\nThe corrected sequence should be:\n1. Move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' and 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n2. Move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5].\n\nThe final action plan in JSON format, combining all steps, is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n\nThis plan efficiently matches the boxes to their respective targets.",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[3.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[3.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])']\nAgent[3.5, 0.5]: I am in square[3.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 1.5]: I am in square[3.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\n\n",

Agent[0.5, 0.5] is in square[0.5, 0.5] with 'box_blue'.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5] is in square[0.5, 1.5] with 'target_green'.\n3. Agent[1.5, 0.5] is in square[1.5, 0.5] with no boxes or targets.\n4. Agent[1.5, 1.5] is in square[1.5, 1.5] with no boxes or targets.\n5. Agent[2.5, 0.5] is in square[2.5, 0.5] with 'target_red'.\n6. Agent[2.5, 1.5] is in square[2.5, 1.5] with 'box_red' and 'box_green'.\n7. Agent[3.5, 0.5] is in square[3.5, 0.5] with no boxes or targets.\n8. Agent[3.5, 1.5] is in square[3.5, 1.5] with 'target_blue'.\n\n### Step 1:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' directly since it's the closest and most efficient first move. So, \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 1.5])\".\n- Agent[2.5, 1.5] has 'box_red' and 'box_green'. It should prioritize moving 'box_red' to 'target_red'. So, \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\".\n\nAction Plan:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 2:\n- After Step 1, 'box_blue' is expected to be moved to 'target_blue' by Agent[0.5, 0.5], so let's correct the understanding: Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' towards 'target_blue'. The most straightforward path is to move it to square[1.5, 0.5] first. So, \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\".\n- Agent[2.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'. Since 'box_red' is now with Agent[2.5, 0.5], it can be directly moved to 'target_red'. So, \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\" is not valid since Agent[2.5, 0.5] doesn't have 'box_red'. The correct action is for Agent[2.5, 1.5] to directly move 'box_red' to 'target_red'. So, \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\".\n\nLet's correct the actions based on the actual possible moves:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[2.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to square[2.5, 0.5].\n\nAction Plan for Step 2:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] now has 'box_blue'.

So, it moves 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5]. \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\".\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] now has 'box_red' and should move it to 'target_red'. So, \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\".\n\nAction Plan for Step 3:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4:\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] now has 'box_blue'. It should move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'. So, \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 1.5])\".\n- Agent[2.5, 1.5] still has 'box_green' and should move it towards 'target_green'. The closest path is to move it to square[1.5, 1.5]. So, \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\".\n\nAction Plan for Step 4:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 5:\n- Agent[3.5, 1.5] has 'target_blue' and Agent[1.5, 1.5] has 'box_blue', so \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\".\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] now has 'box_green'. It should move 'box_green' to 'target_green'. So, \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\".\n\nAction Plan for Step 5:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHowever, the above step has a conflict as it assigns two actions to the same agent. Let's correct the steps and directly provide a feasible sequence.\n\n### Corrected Sequence:\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 0.5].\n2. Agent[2.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to square[2.5, 0.5].\n3. Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5].\n4. Agent[2.5, 0.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n5.

Since target_blue is at square[3.5, 1.5], it's more efficient to move box_blue towards target_blue. So, moving it to square[1.5, 0.5] is a good start.\n     - Agent[2.5, 1.5] has box_red and box_green.

The target_blue is at [3.5, 1.5]. The most efficient first move would be to move box_blue towards target_blue. So, moving box_blue to square[1.5, 0.5] is a good initial step because it's one step closer to the target_blue.\n   - Agent[2.5, 1.5] has box_red and box_green. box_red can be moved to target_red at [2.5, 0.5] directly, which is a high-priority action because it's a direct match.\n\n3. **First Action Plan**:\n   - For Agent[0.5, 0.5]: move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\n   - For Agent[2.5, 1.5]: move(box_red, target_red)\n\nThe first action plan in JSON format:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n4. **Subsequent Steps**:\n   - After the first step, Agent[1.5, 0.5] will have box_blue. It can then move box_blue towards target_blue at [3.5, 1.5]. So, it should move box_blue to square[1.5, 1.5] or square[2.5, 0.5]. Moving to square[2.5, 0.5] might not be the best as it goes sideways; moving to square[1.5, 1.5] is a straightforward step towards the target.\n   - Agent[2.5, 1.5], after dropping box_red, still has box_green. It can move box_green to target_green at [0.5, 1.5]. The closest step would be to move it to square[2.5, 0.5] or towards [0.5, 1.5].

It should prioritize moving box_green to target_green at [0.5, 1.5].\n  - Then, it can move box_blue to target_blue at [3.5, 1.5].\n\nAction for Step 3:\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves box_green to square[0.5, 1.5].\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n- **Step 4**:\n  - Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves box_blue to target_blue.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```",

The closest step is to move it to square[1.5, 0.5] where 'target_green' is located, but it cannot be directly placed on 'target_green' yet because 'target_green' is occupied by 'target_red'. So, it's a valid first move.\n   - For Agent[1.5, 1.5], 'box_red' can be moved towards 'target_red'.

So, it can move 'box_green' to square[1.5, 0.5].\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to 'target_red' at square[1.5, 0.5]. However, since Agent[0.5, 0.5] is also planning to move 'box_green' to square[1.5, 0.5], we need to avoid a conflict. Agent[1.5, 1.5] moving 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5] directly would conflict with Agent[0.5, 0.5]'s action. Instead, Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5] as an intermediate step.\n\nLet's create the second action plan:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"}]\n```\n\n6. **State After Second Action**:\n   - 'box_green' is now at square[1.5, 0.5].\n   - 'box_red' is now at square[0.5, 1.5].\n\n7. **Next Actions**:\n   - Since 'target_green' is at square[1.5, 0.5], Agent[1.5, 0.5] (though it cannot act) is near 'box_green', and it can be matched. However, there's no agent at [1.5, 0.5] to perform the action. Agent[0.5, 1.5] (now free) can move to [1.5, 0.5] but isn't adjacent; it needs to navigate. However, we can directly consider the next best action for 'box_green' and 'box_red'.\n   - 'box_red' at square[0.5, 1.5] can be moved to 'target_red' at square[1.5, 0.5] by Agent[0.5, 1.5]. Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 1.5] and then to square[1.5, 0.5] or directly if possible, but it's not directly possible. So, it moves to an adjacent square first.\n   - 'box_green' is at square[1.5, 0.5] and can be directly matched with 'target_green' by an adjacent agent. Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move to [1.5, 0.5] but isn't needed as we can directly use the fact that 'box_green' is already at the target location when considering the next steps for other boxes.\n\nLet's correct and simplify the subsequent actions:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to square[1.5, 1.5].\n- Then, Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5] (target_red).\n\nSo, the next action plans are:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}]\n[{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"}]\n```\n\nAnd 'box_green' is already at the correct location (square[1.5, 0.5]) with 'target_green', so it's considered matched.\n\nThe final sequence of action plans is:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n```",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6.

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information, identify the boxes and their corresponding targets, and then plan a sequence of actions to move the boxes to their targets.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information\n\nWe have the following agents and their observations:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] has 'box_green' and can move it to square[1.5, 1.5], square[0.5, 0.5], or square[0.5, 2.5].\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] has 'box_red' and can move it to square[0.5, 1.5], square[2.5, 1.5], square[1.5, 0.5], or square[1.5, 2.5].\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] has 'box_blue' and can move it to square[1.5, 0.5], square[3.5, 0.5], or square[2.5, 1.5].\n\nTargets are observed as follows:\n- Agent[2.5, 1.5] observes 'target_red'.\n- Agent[3.5, 1.5] observes 'target_green'.\n- Agent[3.5, 2.5] observes 'target_blue'.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Boxes and Their Corresponding Targets\n\n1. 'box_green' is with Agent[0.5, 1.5] and 'target_green' is observed by Agent[3.5, 1.5].\n2. 'box_red' is with Agent[1.5, 1.5] and 'target_red' is observed by Agent[2.5, 1.5].\n3. 'box_blue' is with Agent[2.5, 0.5] and 'target_blue' is observed by Agent[3.5, 2.5].\n\n### Step 3: Plan the Sequence of Actions\n\nTo match the boxes with their targets efficiently, we prioritize actions that directly move a box to its target or move it closer to its target.\n\n1. Move 'box_red' to 'target_red':\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to square[2.5, 1.5] which is where 'target_red' is located.\n\n2. Move 'box_green' to 'target_green':\n   - First, Agent[0.5, 1.5] needs to move 'box_green' closer to 'target_green'. It can move it to square[1.5, 1.5].\n   - Then, Agent[1.5, 1.5] (after dropping 'box_red') can take 'box_green' and move it towards 'target_green'. However, since Agent[1.5, 1.5] will be busy with 'box_red', we'll plan 'box_green' movement after 'box_red' is moved.\n\n3. Move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue':\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] can move 'box_blue' towards 'target_blue'. It can first move it to square[2.5, 1.5] or square[3.5, 0.5].\n\n### Step 4: Create the Action Plan\n\nLet's start creating the action plan step by step.\n\n1. **Step 1**: \n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to square[2.5, 1.5] (which is 'target_red').\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}`\n\n2. **Step 2**:\n   - Since 'box_red' is now matched, we focus on 'box_green' and 'box_blue'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to square[1.5, 1.5].\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}`\n\n3. **Step 3**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] (now empty) can move 'box_green' from square[1.5, 1.5] to square[2.5, 1.5] and then to square[3.5, 1.5] (which is 'target_green'). However, we need to avoid conflict with 'box_blue' movement. So, it moves 'box_green' to square[2.5, 1.5].\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[3.5, 0.5].\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 0.5])\"}`\n\n4. **Step 4**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] (or the agent in square[2.5, 1.5] if it were possible to pick up) is not available; instead, Agent[2.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' to square[3.5, 1.5] (target_green).\n   - Agent[3.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[3.5, 1.5] is not possible because 'box_blue' is not there, it's actually moving from square[3.5, 0.5] to square[3.5, 2.5] (target_blue).\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[3.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}`\n\nLet's format the action plans into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[3.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[3.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n```",

We need to resolve this.\n\n2. **Revised Step 1**:\n   - Move `box_red` to `target_red`: The agent at `[1.5, 1.5]` moves `box_red` to `[2.5, 1.5]`.\n   - Move `box_green` to `[1.5, 2.5]`: The agent at `[0.5, 1.5]` moves `box_green` to `[1.5, 2.5]`.\n   - Move `box_blue` to `[3.5, 0.5]`: The agent at `[2.5, 0.5]` moves `box_blue` to `[3.5, 0.5]`.\n\n3. **Subsequent Steps**:\n   - Continue the process, adjusting for conflicts and optimizing the path.\n\nLet's directly formulate the JSON action plan based on the steps we've analyzed:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[3.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHowever, the above plan doesn't perfectly follow the initial instructions due to the conflict and the need for a more detailed step-by-step breakdown. Let's correct and simplify the action plan according to the rules and the observed boxes and targets.\n\n### Simplified Action Plan\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[3.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nBut to follow the exact format and directly provide the final answer without explaining inside the answer tags:\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[3.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 0.5]: I am in square[3.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[3.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[3.5, 1.5]: I am in square[3.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\n\n",

So, \"move(box_green, square[3.5, 1.5])\" is a valid action.\n\n3. **First Step Action Plan**:\n   - Since Agent[1.5, 1.5] has both box_blue and target_red, it's efficient to first move box_blue to target_blue (square[1.5, 0.5]) and box_red to target_red (square[1.5, 1.5]).\n   - Thus, the first action plan can be:\n     ```json\n     {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}\n     ```\n\n4. **Subsequent Steps**:\n   - After the first step, box_blue will be moved to square[1.5, 0.5], and box_red will be moved to square[1.5, 1.5].\n   - In the next step, Agent[1.5, 1.5] can directly move box_red to target_red. Agent[3.5, 0.5] can move box_green to target_green.\n     ```json\n     {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[3.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Action Plan**:\n   - Combining the steps, we get the action plan:\n     ```json\n     [\n       {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n       {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[3.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n     ]\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[3.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n</answer> is not needed as per the strict JSON output format required; however, the JSON output is correctly provided above.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[3.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_red, square[3.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_green, square[3.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[3.5, 0.5]: I am in square[3.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 1.5]: I am in square[3.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 2.5]: I am in square[3.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

Agent[2.5, 1.5] can do this.\n- Move 'box_red' from square[2.5, 2.5] to square[1.5, 2.5] towards 'target_red'. Agent[2.5, 2.5] can do this.\n- Move 'box_green' from square[2.5, 2.5] to square[3.5, 2.5] as it's not directly movable to its target. Agent[2.5, 2.5] can't do two actions, so we'll adjust.\n\nAction Plan:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 2:\n- 'box_blue' is now at square[2.5, 2.5] and can be matched with 'target_blue'. Agent[2.5, 2.5] can move it to the target.\n- 'box_red' is at square[1.5, 2.5]. Agent[1.5, 2.5] can move it to square[1.5, 0.5] to match with 'target_red'.\n\nAction Plan Continued:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3:\n- 'box_red' is now being moved towards 'target_red'. Once it's at square[1.5, 0.5], it can be matched.\n- 'box_green' needs to be moved towards 'target_green'. It was moved to square[3.5, 2.5]. Now, it can be moved to square[1.5, 2.5] and then directly to 'target_green'.\n\nAction Plan Continued:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nLet's correct and simplify the action plan based on the available actions and the steps outlined.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])']\n\n",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_green', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, target_green)']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_red', 'box_blue', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)']\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 3.5]: I am in square[1.5, 3.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[3.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 3.5]: I am in square[2.5, 3.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_green, square[3.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[3.5, 0.5]: I am in square[3.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 1.5]: I am in square[3.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 2.5]: I am in square[3.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 3.5]: I am in square[3.5, 3.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and create a sequence of action plans that will match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current State\n\nFrom the given information, we can identify the following:\n- Boxes and their locations: \n  - `box_red` is at `[1.5, 3.5]`.\n  - `box_blue` is at `[2.5, 0.5]`.\n  - `box_green` is at `[2.5, 3.5]`.\n- Targets and their locations:\n  - `target_red` is at `[3.5, 1.5]`.\n  - `target_blue` is at `[2.5, 2.5]`.\n  - `target_green` is at `[1.5, 1.5]`.\n- Agents and their locations:\n  - Agents are located at various squares, with some having the capability to move boxes.\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Actions Based on the Rules\n\n1. **Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets**: We should first identify if any agent is in a position to directly move a box to its target.\n\n2. **Current Possible Moves**:\n   - `Agent[1.5, 3.5]` can move `box_red` to `[0.5, 3.5]`, `[2.5, 3.5]`, or `[1.5, 2.5]`.\n   - `Agent[2.5, 0.5]` can move `box_blue` to `[1.5, 0.5]`, `[3.5, 0.5]`, or `[2.5, 1.5]`.\n   - `Agent[2.5, 3.5]` can move `box_green` to `[1.5, 3.5]`, `[3.5, 3.5]`, or `[2.5, 2.5]`.\n\n### Step 3: Plan the Actions\n\nLet's start planning the actions step by step, following the rules.\n\n#### Step 3.1: First Action Plan\n\n1. `Agent[2.5, 3.5]` can move `box_green` to `[2.5, 2.5]`, which is `target_green` is not there but it's a step towards getting it closer to its target or a position to be further moved. However, since `target_green` is at `[1.5, 1.5]`, moving `box_green` to `[1.5, 3.5]` is a better first step as it moves towards the target's column.\n2. `Agent[1.5, 3.5]` can move `box_red` to `[3.5, 3.5]` is not a good move since it's away from `target_red`, but moving it to `[2.5, 3.5]` or `[1.5, 2.5]` is reasonable. Moving to `[1.5, 2.5]` is a step towards `target_red` indirectly.\n3. `Agent[2.5, 0.5]` can move `box_blue` to `[2.5, 1.5]` or `[2.5, 2.5]`. Moving to `[2.5, 2.5]` is a direct match to `target_blue`.\n\nLet's create the first action plan:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n  \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n  \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3.2: Subsequent Action Plans\n\nAfter the first step:\n- `box_green` is at `[1.5, 3.5]`.\n- `box_red` is at `[1.5, 2.5]`.\n- `box_blue` is at `[2.5, 2.5]`, which is `target_blue`, so it's matched.\n\nLet's continue:\n1. `Agent[1.5, 3.5]` can now hold `box_green` and move it to `[1.5, 2.5]`.\n2. `Agent[1.5, 2.5]` can now hold `box_red` and move it towards `target_red`. It can move to `[0.5, 2.5]` or `[2.5, 2.5]` or directly try to get to `target_red`. A reasonable move is to `[2.5, 2.5]`.\n3. Since `box_blue` is matched, we focus on `box_red` and `box_green`.\n\nLet's analyze further steps:\n- Move `box_green` to `target_green` at `[1.5, 1.5]`.\n- Move `box_red` to `target_red` at `[3.5, 1.5]`.\n\n### Step 4: Continuing the Action Plans\n\nLet's continue the action planning process.\n\nAfter the first action plan:\n- `Agent[1.5, 3.5]` is now at `[1.5, 3.5]` with no box, and `box_green` is at `[1.5, 3.5]`.\n- `Agent[1.5, 2.5]` is now holding `box_red`.\n- `Agent[2.5, 2.5]` is now at `[2.5, 2.5]` with `box_blue` matched to `target_blue`.\n\nSubsequent steps will involve moving `box_green` to `target_green` and `box_red` to `target_red`.\n\nHere is a simplified continuation:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nLet's directly provide the final sequence in the required format.\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n\n</answer>[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]</answer>",

Moving to `[2.5, 2.5]` is a direct match to `target_blue`.\n\nLet's create the first action plan:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n  \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n  \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3.2: Subsequent Action Plans\n\nAfter the first step:\n- `box_green` is at `[1.5, 3.5]`.\n- `box_red` is at `[1.5, 2.5]`.\n- `box_blue` is at `[2.5, 2.5]`, which is `target_blue`, so it's matched.\n\nLet's continue:\n1. `Agent[1.5, 3.5]` can now hold `box_green` and move it to `[1.5, 2.5]`.\n2. `Agent[1.5, 2.5]` can now hold `box_red` and move it towards `target_red`. It can move to `[0.5, 2.5]` or `[2.5, 2.5]` or directly try to get to `target_red`. A reasonable move is to `[2.5, 2.5]`.\n3. Since `box_blue` is matched, we focus on `box_red` and `box_green`.\n\nLet's analyze further steps:\n- Move `box_green` to `target_green` at `[1.5, 1.5]`.\n- Move `box_red` to `target_red` at `[3.5, 1.5]`.\n\n### Step 4: Continuing the Action Plans\n\nLet's continue the action planning process.\n\nAfter the first action plan:\n- `Agent[1.5, 3.5]` is now at `[1.5, 3.5]` with no box, and `box_green` is at `[1.5, 3.5]`.\n- `Agent[1.5, 2.5]` is now holding `box_red`.\n- `Agent[2.5, 2.5]` is now at `[2.5, 2.5]` with `box_blue` matched to `target_blue`.\n\nSubsequent steps will involve moving `box_green` to `target_green` and `box_red` to `target_red`.\n\nHere is a simplified continuation:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nLet's directly provide the final sequence in the required format.\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n\n</answer>[\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[3.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_blue', 'target_blue', 'box_green', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, target_green)']\n\n",

          "full_model_response": "To create an efficient action plan, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] is in square[0.5, 0.5] with 'box_red'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] is in square[0.5, 1.5] with 'box_blue', 'box_green', 'target_blue', 'target_green', and 'target_red'.\n\n2. **Prioritizing Actions**:\n   - For Agent[0.5, 0.5], the action is to move 'box_red' to either an adjacent square or 'target_red'. Since 'target_red' is in square[0.5, 1.5], it can directly move 'box_red' to 'target_red' if we plan the actions correctly.\n   - For Agent[0.5, 1.5], there are multiple boxes and targets. The priority should be to match boxes with their respective targets.\n\n3. **Step 1**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to 'target_red'. Since 'target_red' is in square[0.5, 1.5], the action for Agent[0.5, 0.5] is \"move(box_red, target_red)\".\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] has 'box_blue' and 'box_green' and their respective targets. It can move one of these boxes to its target. Let's prioritize \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\" and \"move(box_green, target_green)\".\n\n   However, since Agent[0.5, 0.5] needs to move 'box_red' to 'target_red' which is in the same square as Agent[0.5, 1.5], we need to ensure that the actions do not conflict. Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to 'target_red', but we should check if it's feasible without conflict.\n\n4. **Conflict Resolution and Action Planning**:\n   - In the first step, let's have Agent[0.5, 0.5] move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5] as it's the adjacent square, and then Agent[0.5, 1.5] can directly move 'box_red' to 'target_red' in the next step or simply have Agent[0.5, 0.5] move 'box_red' to 'target_red' directly if possible.\n\n5. **Action Plan**:\n   - Step 1: Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'. However, given the direct action is not listed, we'll move it to square[0.5, 1.5].\n   - Step 1 Action Plan: `{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"}`\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] can then act on 'box_blue' and 'box_green'.\n\n6. **Subsequent Steps**:\n   - After Step 1, 'box_red' will be in square[0.5, 1.5]. Agent[0.5, 1.5] can then move 'box_red' to 'target_red', and also move 'box_blue' and 'box_green' to their respective targets.\n\nLet's create the action plan:\n\nStep 1:\n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"}\n```\n\nAfter this move, 'box_red' will be in square[0.5, 1.5]. \n\nStep 2:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] can now move 'box_red' to 'target_red', 'box_blue' to 'target_blue', and 'box_green' to 'target_green'. Let's prioritize one action.\n\n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n```\n\nStep 3:\n- Now, Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n\n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n```\n\nStep 4:\n- Finally, Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n```\n\nSo, the final action plan is:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

This is a good initial move because it doesn't directly match 'box_red' to 'target_red' but is a step towards it.\n   - For Agent[0.5, 1.5], there are multiple possible actions. The priority should be given to matching boxes to their targets. So, 'move(box_blue, target_blue)' and 'move(box_green, target_green)' are high-priority actions.\n\n3. **First Step Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5].\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' and 'box_green' to 'target_green' simultaneously, but according to the rules, we can only assign one action per agent at a time. So, we prioritize one of these actions. Let's prioritize 'move(box_blue, target_blue)' for Agent[0.5, 1.5] in the first step because it directly matches a box to its target.\n\n4. **First Step Action Plan JSON**:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}]\n   ```\n\n5. **Subsequent Steps**:\n   - After the first step, 'box_blue' will be matched to 'target_blue', and 'box_red' will be in square[0.5, 1.5].\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] can now move 'box_green' to 'target_green' as it's a direct match.\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] having moved 'box_blue' to 'target_blue', now 'box_red' is in the same square as 'target_red'. So, Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n\n6. **Subsequent Steps Action Plan**:\n   - Second step: Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, target_green)\"}]\n   ```\n   - Third step: Since 'box_red' is now in the same square as 'target_red', Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move it to 'target_red'. Agent[0.5, 0.5] doesn't have any box to move.\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, target_green)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}]\n   ```\n\nLet's format this into the required JSON output.\n\n<answer>\n[\n{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}, \n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, target_green)\"}, \n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n\nThis sequence ensures that all boxes are matched to their corresponding targets efficiently.",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_blue', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_green', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, target_green)']\n\n",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we will analyze the given information and create a step-by-step action plan.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\n\nWe have three agents:\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5] with 'box_blue', 'target_blue', and 'target_red' observable. Possible actions: 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])' or 'move(box_blue, target_blue)'.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5] with 'box_red' observable. Possible actions: 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])' or 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])'.\n3. Agent[0.5, 2.5] with 'box_green' and 'target_green' observable. Possible actions: 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])' or 'move(box_green, target_green)'.\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Actions Based on the Rules\n\n1. **Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets**: \n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\n2. **Other Actions**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to either square[0.5, 0.5] or square[0.5, 2.5]. Since moving to square[0.5, 2.5] is closer to potentially matching 'box_red' with a 'target_red' (though 'target_red' is not observed by Agent[0.5, 1.5] or Agent[0.5, 2.5], it's a forward move), it's a reasonable action.\n\n### Step 3: Create the First Action Plan\n\nBased on the prioritization:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] should move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] should move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] should move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 2.5] (since it's a forward move towards potentially finding or getting closer to 'target_red').\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the State After the First Action Plan\n\nAfter executing the first action plan:\n- 'box_blue' and 'box_green' are matched to their targets.\n- 'box_red' is now in square[0.5, 2.5].\n\nThe new state:\n1. Agent[0.5, 2.5] is now in square[0.5, 2.5] with 'box_red' observable (since it moved there). It can observe 'box_red' and 'target_green' (though 'target_green' is already matched). Possible actions related to 'box_red': it can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5] or potentially to a 'target_red' if observed, but 'target_red' is not observable by Agent[0.5, 2.5].\n\n### Step 5: Create the Next Action Plan\n\nSince 'box_red' is in square[0.5, 2.5] and 'target_red' is in square[0.5, 0.5], Agent[0.5, 2.5] should move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5], and then Agent[0.5, 1.5] can take it and move it to square[0.5, 0.5] where 'target_red' is.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Combining the Action Plans\n\nThe complete action plan is a combination of the steps outlined:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 3.5]: I am in square[1.5, 3.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 3.5]: I am in square[2.5, 3.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

Since `target_blue` is closer to `square[0.5, 0.5]` and `target_red` is at `square[0.5, 2.5]`, we should prioritize moving `box_blue` towards `target_blue`.\n     - So, `Agent[1.5, 0.5]` can move `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n   \n   - **Action Plan for Step 1**:\n     ```json\n     {\"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"}\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 2**:\n     - After Step 1, `box_green` is at `square[1.5, 0.5]`. `Agent[1.5, 0.5]` can now move it to `target_green` at `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n     - `box_blue` is at `square[0.5, 0.5]`. `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` can move it to `target_blue` at `square[0.5, 1.5]`.\n     - So, the actions are: `Agent[1.5, 0.5]` moves `box_green` to `target_green`, and `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` moves `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n\n   - **Action Plan for Step 2**:\n     ```json\n     {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 3**:\n     - `box_red` is still at `square[1.5, 0.5]`. `Agent[1.5, 0.5]` can move it to `target_red` at `square[0.5, 2.5]`. It needs to be moved to an adjacent square first.\n     - `Agent[1.5, 0.5]` can move `box_red` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`.\n\n   - **Action Plan for Step 3**:\n     ```json\n     {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 4**:\n     - `box_red` is now at `square[1.5, 1.5]`. `Agent[1.5, 1.5]` can move it to `square[1.5, 2.5]`.\n   \n   - **Action Plan for Step 4**:\n     ```json\n     {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"}\n     ```\n\n   - **Step 5**:\n     - `box_red` is now at `square[1.5, 2.5]`. `Agent[1.5, 2.5]` can move it to `square[0.5, 2.5]`, which is `target_red`.\n   \n   - **Action Plan for Step 5**:\n     ```json\n     {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n     ```\n\n4. **Combining Action Plans**:\n   The sequence of action plans is as follows:\n\n   ```json\n   [\n     {\"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n     {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n     {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n     {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n     {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n   ]\n   ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

Since 'target_red' is at [0.5, 2.5] and 'target_blue' is at [0.5, 1.5], it's more efficient to move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' directly or in the next steps. So, moving 'box_blue' towards 'target_blue' is a good start.\n2. **Agent[2.5, 0.5]** can move 'box_green' to 'target_green' at [0.5, 0.5]. The most direct path is to move it to [1.5, 0.5] first.\n\n### Step 3: Create the First Action Plan\n\n- **Agent[1.5, 0.5]** can move 'box_blue' to [1.5, 1.5] as a first step towards 'target_blue' at [0.5, 1.5].\n- **Agent[2.5, 0.5]** can move 'box_green' to [1.5, 0.5].\n\nThe first action plan in JSON format:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Continue Planning Subsequent Actions\n\nAfter the first action:\n- 'box_blue' is at [1.5, 1.5].\n- 'box_green' is at [1.5, 0.5].\n\n1. **Agent[1.5, 1.5]** (now can observe 'box_blue') can move 'box_blue' to [0.5, 1.5] which is 'target_blue'.\n2. **Agent[1.5, 0.5]** (now can observe 'box_red' and 'box_green') can move 'box_green' to [0.5, 0.5] which is 'target_green'.\n\nSubsequent action plan:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Plan for 'box_red'\n\nAfter 'box_blue' and 'box_green' are matched:\n- 'box_red' is still at [1.5, 0.5].\n\n1. **Agent[1.5, 0.5]** can move 'box_red' towards 'target_red' at [0.5, 2.5]. The first step is to move it to [1.5, 1.5] or [1.5, 2.5].\n\nLet's continue:\n- Move 'box_red' to [1.5, 1.5] (though it's occupied by 'box_blue' in the previous step, now it's free), then to [1.5, 2.5], and finally to [0.5, 2.5].\n\n### Step 6: Update the Action Plan\n\nContinuing from the previous steps:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_red', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)']\nAgent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])']\n\n",

It can move 'box_blue' to either square[0.5, 0.5] or square[0.5, 2.5].\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] has a 'box_red' and there are 'target_red' and 'target_blue'. It can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5], square[0.5, 3.5], or directly to 'target_red'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 3.5] has a 'box_green' and can move it to square[0.5, 2.5].\n\n2. **Prioritizing Actions**:\n   - Since 'box_red' is at square[0.5, 2.5] and 'target_red' is also at square[0.5, 2.5], Agent[0.5, 2.5] can directly move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n   - 'box_blue' is at square[0.5, 1.5] and there's no 'target_blue' nearby. Agent[0.5, 1.5] should move 'box_blue' towards 'target_blue' at square[0.5, 2.5]. So, it should move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n   - 'box_green' is at square[0.5, 3.5]. Agent[0.5, 3.5] should move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5] where 'target_green' is located.\n\n3. **First Step Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n   - Agent[0.5, 3.5] moves 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n\nHowever, since multiple agents are trying to move boxes to square[0.5, 2.5], we need to resolve this conflict. Let's adjust the plan:\n\n1. **Adjusted First Step**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'. (No conflict)\n   - Agent[0.5, 3.5] moves 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5]. (Prepares 'box_green' to be matched with 'target_green')\n\n2. **Second Step**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 2.5]. (Now 'box_blue' and 'box_green' are at the same square)\n   - Since 'target_blue' is not at square[0.5, 2.5], we need to decide which box to move next. 'box_green' should be moved to 'target_green'.\n\n3. **Third Step**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] (now empty) is not needed.\n   - One of the agents at square[0.5, 2.5] (either the one that moved 'box_blue' or 'box_green' there) should move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' if it's there, or continue moving it towards 'target_blue' if known.\n\nLet's simplify and directly create a feasible plan based on the given observations and rules.\n\n### Action Plan:\n\n1. **Step 1**:\n   - {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}\n\n2. **Step 2**:\n   - Since 'box_green' and 'target_green' are now at the same square, Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move 'box_green' to 'target_green'. Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n   - {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}\n\n3. **Step 3**:\n   - Now, 'box_blue' is at square[0.5, 2.5] where 'target_blue' is located. Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n   - {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n\n### JSON Action Plan:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

It can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5], square[0.5, 3.5], or directly to 'target_red'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 3.5] has a 'box_green'. It can move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n\n2. **Prioritizing Actions**:\n   - Since 'box_red' is at square[0.5, 2.5] and 'target_red' is also at square[0.5, 2.5], Agent[0.5, 2.5] can directly move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n   - 'box_blue' is at square[0.5, 1.5]. The nearest 'target_blue' is at square[0.5, 2.5]. Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 2.5], and then it can be matched with 'target_blue'.\n   - 'box_green' is at square[0.5, 3.5].

All three agents are trying to move boxes to square[0.5, 2.5], which could cause a conflict. Let's adjust the plan.\n\n4. **Adjusted First Step**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'. (No conflict)\n   - Agent[0.5, 3.5] moves 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5].

Instead, we can move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 0.5] in the first step.\n\n   So, the first step action plan is:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"}]\n   ```\n\n5. **Subsequent Steps**:\n   - After the first step, 'box_red' is matched, 'box_green' is at square[0.5, 2.5] where 'target_green' is, so 'box_green' can be moved to 'target_green' in the next step.\n   - 'box_blue' is now at square[0.5, 0.5]. Agent[0.5, 0.5] is initially empty and can now move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 1.5] (its original position), and then 'box_blue' can be moved to square[0.5, 2.5] where 'target_blue' is.\n\n6. **Second Step Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] is now occupied with 'box_blue' (from the previous step), so it moves 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 1.5].\n\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"}]\n   ```\n\n7. **Third Step Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 2.5] where 'target_blue' is.\n\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}]\n   ```\n\nThe final action plan is a sequence of these steps:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_green', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, target_green)']\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

This is a priority action.\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] has 'box_blue' but there's no 'target_blue' in its observable area. It needs to move 'box_blue' towards a target or a position that could be more strategic. Since 'target_blue' is observed by Agent[2.5, 0.5], we know it's at square[2.5, 0.5]. Thus, moving 'box_blue' to square[2.5, 0.5] is a good step.\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] has 'box_red' and can move it. Since 'target_red' is at square[0.5, 1.5], it should ideally move 'box_red' towards it. The first step could be to move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5].\n\n3. **First Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[2.5, 0.5] to get it closer to 'target_blue'.\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] moves 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5] as a step towards 'target_red'.\n\n4. **JSON Action Plan for Step 1**:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nLet's continue planning subsequent steps based on the new positions after the first action.\n\n### After Step 1:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] has moved 'box_blue' to square[2.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] has moved 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] has moved 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\nNew Observability:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] is now empty and can observe 'box_red'.\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] now has 'box_blue' and is on 'target_blue'.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] has done its task.\n\n### Step 2:\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] can now move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' directly.\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' towards 'target_red' at square[0.5, 1.5]. The closest step is to move it to square[0.5, 0.5].\n\n### JSON Action Plan for Step 2:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Continuing this process:\nAfter Step 2, 'box_blue' is matched with 'target_blue'. Now, we need to get 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n\n### Step 3:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] has 'box_red' and can move it to square[0.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] is empty and can potentially move 'box_red' if it's moved to it.\n\nLet's correct and simplify the steps for a straightforward solution.\n\n### Simplified Plan:\n1. Move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n2. Move 'box_blue' to square[2.5, 0.5] and then to 'target_blue'.\n3. Move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5], then to square[0.5, 0.5], and finally to square[0.5, 1.5] ('target_red').\n\nLet's directly construct the final action plan.\n\n### Final Action Plan:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>",

The closest 'target_red' is observed by Agent[0.5, 1.5], so 'box_red' should be moved towards it.\n\n3. **First Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green': \"move(box_green, target_green)\".\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 0.5]: \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\".\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] moves 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5]: \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\".\n\n   First action plan in JSON format:\n   ```json\n   {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"}\n   ```\n\n4. **Subsequent Action Plans**:\n   - After the first action, Agent[1.5, 0.5] is empty, and 'box_blue' is at square[0.5, 0.5]. Agent[0.5, 0.5] can potentially move it.\n   - 'box_red' is now at square[1.5, 0.5]. Agent[1.5, 0.5] can move it to square[1.5, 1.5] or square[0.5, 0.5], but ideally towards 'target_red'. So, it should move to square[1.5, 1.5].\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] has completed its task.\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] is now empty.\n\nLet's continue with the subsequent steps based on the new positions.\n\n- 'box_blue' is at square[0.5, 0.5]. Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move it to square[0.5, 1.5] which has 'target_red', but 'box_blue' doesn't match 'target_red'. However, it's a step towards potentially getting 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' if we knew its location. Since 'target_blue' is at square[2.5, 0.5], Agent[0.5, 0.5] should move 'box_blue' towards it. The next step for 'box_blue' could be to move to square[1.5, 0.5] or directly towards 'target_blue' if possible.\n- 'box_red' is now at square[1.5, 1.5]. Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move it to square[0.5, 1.5] which has 'target_red', so \"move(box_red, target_red)\".\n\nSecond action plan:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 0.5]: \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\".\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red': \"move(box_red, target_red)\".\n\n   ```json\n   {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n   ```\n\nAfter the second action:\n- 'box_blue' is at square[1.5, 0.5]. Agent[1.5, 0.5] can move it towards 'target_blue' at square[2.5, 0.5].\n\nThird action plan:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[2.5, 0.5]: \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\".\n\n   ```json\n   {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n   ```\n\nThe final sequence of action plans is:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

This is a priority action.\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] has 'box_blue' but there's no 'target_blue' in its observable area. It needs to move 'box_blue' towards a target or a position that could be more strategic. Since 'target_blue' is observed by Agent[2.5, 0.5], we know it's at square[2.5, 0.5]. Thus, moving 'box_blue' to square[2.5, 0.5] is a good step.\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] has 'box_red' and can move it. Since 'target_red' is at square[0.5, 1.5], it should ideally move 'box_red' towards it. The first step could be to move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5].\n\n3. **First Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[2.5, 0.5] to get it closer to 'target_blue'.\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] moves 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5] as a step towards 'target_red'.\n\n4. **JSON Action Plan for Step 1**:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nLet's continue planning subsequent steps based on the new positions after the first action.\n\n### After Step 1:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] has moved 'box_blue' to square[2.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] has moved 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] has moved 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\nNew Observability:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] is now empty and can observe 'box_red'.\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] now has 'box_blue' and is on 'target_blue'.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] has done its task.\n\n### Step 2:\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] can now move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' directly.\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' towards 'target_red' at square[0.5, 1.5].

Now, we need to get 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n\n### Step 3:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] has 'box_red' and can move it to square[0.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] is empty and can potentially move 'box_red' if it's moved to it.\n\nLet's correct and simplify the steps for a straightforward solution.\n\n### Simplified Plan:\n1.

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]).

Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3.

          "full_model_response": "To create an efficient action plan, let's analyze the given information and proceed step by step.\n\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] is in square[0.5, 0.5] and observes ['target_red', 'target_blue'].\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] is in square[0.5, 1.5] and observes ['box_red', 'box_blue', 'box_green']. It can move any of these boxes to either square[0.5, 0.5] or square[0.5, 2.5].\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] is in square[0.5, 2.5] and observes ['target_green'].\n\n2. **Prioritizing Actions**:\n   - Since Agent[0.5, 1.5] has the boxes and can move them, we should prioritize matching these boxes to their respective targets.\n   - The possible targets are 'target_red', 'target_blue' observed by Agent[0.5, 0.5], and 'target_green' observed by Agent[0.5, 2.5].\n\n3. **First Step**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to 'target_red' directly or to square[0.5, 0.5] where 'target_red' is located. The most efficient action is to move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 0.5].\n   - Similarly, 'box_blue' can be moved to square[0.5, 0.5] where 'target_blue' is.\n   - 'box_green' should be moved to square[0.5, 2.5] where 'target_green' is located.\n\n   Thus, the first action plan could be:\n   ```json\n   {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"}\n   ```\n   Followed by:\n   ```json\n   {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"}\n   ```\n   And then:\n   ```json\n   {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}\n   ```\n\n4. **Subsequent Steps**:\n   - After moving 'box_red' and 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 0.5], Agent[0.5, 0.5] can directly move them to their respective targets since it observes both 'target_red' and 'target_blue'.\n   - After moving 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5], Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move it to 'target_green'.\n\nSo, the sequence of action plans will be:\n1. Move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 0.5].\n2. Move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 0.5].\n3. Move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n4. Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n5. Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n6. Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\nLet's format this into the required JSON action plans:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

The agent can move a box to either `square[0.5, 0.5]` or `square[0.5, 2.5]`. We should prioritize moving a box to its target if possible.\n\n- Moving `box_red` to `square[0.5, 0.5]` allows `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` to potentially move it to `target_red`.\n- Moving `box_green` to `square[0.5, 2.5]` allows `Agent[0.5, 2.5]` to potentially move it to `target_green`.\n\nLet's move `box_red` to `square[0.5, 0.5]` and `box_green` to `square[0.5, 2.5]`. However, we can only assign one action per agent at a time.\n\n### Step 3: Create the First Action Plan\n\nLet's prioritize `box_red` because it's closer to its target relative to the agent's position. So, `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` will move `box_red` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"}]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the State After the First Action\n\nAfter `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` moves `box_red` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`:\n1. `Agent[0.5, 0.5]`: Now observes `['target_red', 'target_blue', 'box_red']`, and can potentially move `box_red` to `target_red`.\n2. `Agent[0.5, 1.5]`: Now observes `['box_blue', 'box_green']`, and can move either to `square[0.5, 0.5]` or `square[0.5, 2.5]`.\n3. `Agent[0.5, 2.5]`: Still observes `['target_green']`.\n\n### Step 5: Plan the Next Actions\n\n1. `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` can now move `box_red` to `target_red`.\n2. `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` should move `box_green` to `square[0.5, 2.5]` so that `Agent[0.5, 2.5]` can move it to `target_green`.\n\n### Step 6: Create the Subsequent Action Plans\n\n1. First, `Agent[0.5, 0.5]` moves `box_red` to `target_red`, and `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` moves `box_green` to `square[0.5, 2.5]`.\n   \n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"}, \n {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}]\n```\n\n2. Then, `Agent[0.5, 2.5]` moves `box_green` to `target_green`, and `Agent[0.5, 1.5]` moves `box_blue` to `square[0.5, 0.5]`.\n\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"}, \n {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\":\"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"}]\n```\n\n3.

Let's continue with 'box_red' to 'target_red' in the next step after 'box_green' is dealt with.\n   - After moving 'box_green' to 'target_green', Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 0.5] in the next step, and then Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n\n6. **Detailed Subsequent Steps**:\n   - Step 1: Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n   - Step 2: Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves 'box_green' to 'target_green', and Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to square[0.5, 0.5].\n   - Step 3: Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red', and Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 0.5].\n   - Step 4: Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n\n7. **Action Plan**:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\":\"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\":\"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6.

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and create a sequence of action plans that will match all boxes to their color-coded targets efficiently.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State\n\nFrom the given information, we can observe the following:\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] is in square[0.5, 2.5] with 'box_green' and can move it to square[1.5, 2.5], square[0.5, 1.5], or square[0.5, 3.5].\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] is in square[2.5, 0.5] with 'target_green'.\n- Agent[2.5, 3.5] is in square[2.5, 3.5] with 'box_blue' and can move it to square[1.5, 3.5], square[3.5, 3.5], or square[2.5, 2.5].\n- Agent[0.5, 3.5] is in square[0.5, 3.5] with 'target_blue'.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] is in square[0.5, 1.5] with 'target_red'.\n- Agent[3.5, 2.5] is in square[3.5, 2.5] with 'box_red' and can move it to square[2.5, 2.5], square[3.5, 1.5], or square[3.5, 3.5].\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Actions\n\nFirst, we prioritize actions that match boxes to their targets directly or move them closer to their targets.\n\n1. **Move 'box_green' to 'target_green'**: Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move 'box_green' to square[1.5, 2.5] as a first step towards 'target_green' at square[2.5, 0.5]. So, the action is \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\".\n2. **Move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'**: Agent[2.5, 3.5] can move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 3.5] as a step towards 'target_blue' at square[0.5, 3.5]. So, the action is \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])\".\n3. **Move 'box_red' to 'target_red'**: Agent[3.5, 2.5] can move 'box_red' to square[2.5, 2.5] as a step towards 'target_red' at square[0.5, 1.5]. So, the action is \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\".\n\n### Step 3: Create the First Action Plan\n\nBased on the prioritized actions, the first action plan can be formulated as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Continue Planning Subsequent Steps\n\n1. **Continue moving 'box_green' towards 'target_green'**: Agent[1.5, 2.5] (assuming it moves to square[1.5, 2.5]) can move 'box_green' to square[2.5, 2.5]. Then, Agent[2.5, 2.5] can move it to square[2.5, 1.5] and finally to 'target_green'.\n2. **Continue moving 'box_blue' towards 'target_blue'**: Agent[1.5, 3.5] (after 'box_blue' is moved there) can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' at square[0.5, 3.5].\n3. **Continue moving 'box_red' towards 'target_red'**: Agent[2.5, 2.5] can move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 2.5], then to square[1.5, 1.5], and finally to 'target_red' at square[0.5, 1.5].\n\n### Step 5: Formulate Subsequent Action Plans\n\nLet's continue the planning process:\n\n- Step 2:\n  - Agent[1.5, 2.5]: \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  - Agent[1.5, 3.5]: \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 3.5])\" (directly to target)\n  - Agent[2.5, 2.5]: \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n\n- Step 3:\n  - Agent[2.5, 2.5]: \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  - Agent[1.5, 2.5]: \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n\n- Step 4:\n  - Agent[2.5, 1.5]: \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])\" (directly to target)\n  - Agent[1.5, 1.5]: \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\" (directly to target)\n\n### Step 6: Compile the Action Plans\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])\",\n    \"Agent[3.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\n\n",

So, \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\".\n- **Agent[1.5, 2.5]** is now at square[1.5, 2.5] with 'box_green'. It can move 'box_green' to square[2.5, 2.5].

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7.

Agent[1.5, 1.5] has completed its task.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5] has moved 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5].\n3. 'box_red' is still with Agent[1.5, 0.5].\n\nNow, 'box_red' can be moved to 'target_red' at square[1.5, 1.5]. However, 'box_blue' is already there. We need to resolve this.\n\n### Step 5: Resolve Potential Conflicts and Continue\n\nSince both 'box_blue' and 'box_red' are needed to be at 'target_blue' and 'target_red' respectively, and they are at the same square, we need to prioritize one.\n\nLet's directly move 'box_red' to 'target_red' since it's a direct match.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\n\n",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and create a sequence of action plans that will match all boxes to their color-coded targets efficiently.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current State\n\nFrom the given information, we can observe the following:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] is in square[0.5, 0.5] and can see ['target_green'].\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] is in square[0.5, 1.5] and can see ['target_red', 'box_blue', 'box_green'].\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] is in square[0.5, 2.5] and can see [].\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] is in square[1.5, 0.5] and can see [].\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] is in square[1.5, 1.5] and can see ['box_red'].\n- Agent[1.5, 2.5] is in square[1.5, 2.5] and can see ['target_blue'].\n\n### Step 2: Identify Possible Actions\n\nBased on the observations:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' or 'box_green' to adjacent squares or potentially directly to their targets if the targets were in adjacent squares. 'box_blue' can be moved towards 'target_blue' at [1.5, 2.5], and 'box_green' can be moved towards 'target_green' at [0.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to adjacent squares, including towards 'target_red' at [0.5, 1.5].\n\n### Step 3: Prioritize Actions\n\n1. **Move 'box_red' to 'target_red'**: Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5] where 'target_red' is located.\n2. **Move 'box_blue' towards 'target_blue'**: Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5].\n3. **Move 'box_green' towards 'target_green'**: Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 0.5].\n\n### Step 4: Create Action Plans\n\n#### Step 1 Action Plan\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red' at square[0.5, 1.5]. However, since 'target_red' is in the same square as the agent's destination, it can directly move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5].\n\n```json\n[{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}]\n```\n\n#### Step 2 Action Plan\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to square[0.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] is now in square[0.5, 1.5] and has completed its task. Agent[1.5, 1.5] is not included in the action plan as it has no further tasks.\n\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"}]\n```\n\n#### Step 3 Action Plan\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] (now at [0.5, 1.5]) is not acting; it's idle. Agent[1.5, 1.5] is not included.\n- The agent at [1.5, 1.5] is now at [0.5, 1.5], so the agent that was at [1.5, 1.5] and moved 'box_red' is now at [0.5, 1.5]. Let's correct the understanding: After moving 'box_red', Agent[1.5, 1.5] is at [0.5, 1.5], so we actually need to consider the next actions based on the corrected positions.\n- The box 'box_blue' is now at [1.5, 1.5]. Agent[1.5, 1.5] (originally, now at [0.5, 1.5]) is not acting. The agent at [1.5, 1.5] is actually the one that was at [0.5, 1.5] before moving 'box_blue'. So, the correct next step involves moving 'box_blue' from [1.5, 1.5] to [1.5, 2.5] where 'target_blue' is.\n\nLet's correct and simplify the action planning based on the initial analysis and directly provide the simplified and corrected action plan.\n\n### Simplified Action Plan\n\n1. Move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n2. Move 'box_blue' towards 'target_blue'.\n3. Move 'box_green' towards 'target_green'.\n4. Continue 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n\nLet's directly format the answer as per the given format.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

It has no boxes to move.\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] is in square[0.5, 1.5] with 'target_red', 'box_blue', and 'box_green' observable. It can move 'box_blue' or 'box_green' to adjacent squares.\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] is in square[0.5, 2.5] with no observables.\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] is in square[1.5, 0.5] with no observables.\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] is in square[1.5, 1.5] with 'box_red' observable. It can move 'box_red' to adjacent squares.\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5] is in square[1.5, 2.5] with 'target_blue' observable. It has no boxes to move.\n\n2. **Prioritizing Actions**:\n   - The closest box to its target should be moved first. 'box_red' is in square[1.5, 1.5] and 'target_red' is in square[0.5, 1.5], so moving 'box_red' to 'target_red' is a priority.\n   - 'box_blue' is in square[0.5, 1.5] and 'target_blue' is in square[1.5, 2.5]. Moving 'box_blue' towards 'target_blue' is the next priority.\n   - 'box_green' is in square[0.5, 1.5] and there's a 'target_green' in square[0.5, 0.5]. Moving 'box_green' towards 'target_green' is also a priority.\n\n3. **First Step**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5] where 'target_red' is located. So, \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\".\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5] as a step towards 'target_blue'. So, \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\".\n   - Alternatively, Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 0.5] where 'target_green' is. So, \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\".\n\nLet's choose the actions for the first step:\n- \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n- \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n\nThe first action plan is:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"}]\n```\n\n4. **Subsequent Steps**:\n   - After the first step, 'box_red' will be in square[0.5, 1.5] and can be moved to 'target_red' in the same square. So, \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\".\n   - 'box_green' will be in square[0.5, 0.5] and can be moved to 'target_green' in the same square. So, \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\".\n   - 'box_blue' is still in square[0.5, 1.5]. Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move it to square[1.5, 1.5]. Then, it can be moved to square[1.5, 2.5] where 'target_blue' is.\n\nLet's continue planning:\n- Second step: \n  - \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  - \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n- Third step:\n  - \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n- Fourth step:\n  - \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n- Fifth step:\n  - \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n\nThe subsequent action plans are:\n```json\n[\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nCombining all steps into a single list as required:\n```json\n[\n{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\", \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6.

However, given the constraints, we directly plan for available agents.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHowever, we must adjust our plan according to the given agent capabilities and positions.\n\nLet's directly create a feasible plan based on the information and adjust for the specific format required.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```",

There's no direct 'target_green' observed, so 'box_green' should be moved towards a potential 'target_green'. The closest observed target related to 'box_green' is 'target_green' at Agent[0.5, 0.5].

'box_green' can be moved to 'target_green' by Agent[0.5, 0.5].\n3.

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7.

Since there's `target_blue` in `square[2.5, 1.5]`, moving `box_blue` towards it is a good start.

The closest step is to move `box_red` to `square[1.5, 1.5]` or `square[2.5, 0.5]`. Moving to `square[2.5, 0.5]` is a step towards `target_red` but not directly towards it.

Now, `Agent[1.5, 2.5]` (previously done) is now free to move to `square[1.5, 2.5]` and can move `box_blue` to `square[2.5, 2.5]` or directly to `target_blue` if possible. However, `Agent[1.5, 2.5]` is in `square[1.5, 1.5]`, so it needs to move to `square[1.5, 2.5]` first. Let's correct the sequence: `Agent[1.5, 1.5]` can move to `square[1.5, 2.5]` and then handle `box_blue`.\n- `Agent[2.5, 1.5]` moved `box_red` to `square[2.5, 0.5]`. Now, `Agent[2.5, 0.5]` can move it to `square[1.5, 0.5]` and then to `square[0.5, 0.5]` where `target_red` is.\n\n### Action Plan for Step 2\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(None, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(None, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHowever, the correct sequence should be adjusted according to the rules and the current state.\n\n### Step 3 and Beyond\n\nContinuing this process:\n\n- Move `box_blue` to `target_blue`.\n- Move `box_red` to `target_red`.\n\nLet's directly construct a feasible sequence:\n\n1. `Agent[1.5, 2.5]` moves `box_green` to `target_green`.\n2. `Agent[0.5, 2.5]` moves `box_blue` to `square[1.5, 2.5]`.\n3. `Agent[2.5, 1.5]` moves `box_red` to `square[2.5, 0.5]`.\n4. `Agent[1.5, 1.5]` moves to `square[1.5, 2.5]`, then `Agent[1.5, 2.5]` moves `box_blue` to `square[2.5, 2.5]`, and then to `target_blue`.\n5. `Agent[2.5, 0.5]` moves to `square[2.5, 1.5]`, then `Agent[2.5, 1.5]` moves `box_red` to `square[1.5, 1.5]`, then to `square[0.5, 1.5]`, and finally to `target_red`.\n\nHere's a simplified and corrected action plan:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(None, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(None, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(None, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHowever, the exact steps might need further refinement based on the exact rules and the state after each action.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(None, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(None, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(None, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```",

The most direct path is to move it to `square[1.5, 1.5]` and then towards `target_red`.\n\n#### Step 2.3: Create a Sequence of Action Plans\n\nLet's create a step-by-step action plan:\n\n1. **Step 1:**\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5] moves `box_green` to `target_green` (square[1.5, 1.5]).\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"}`\n\n2. **Step 2:**\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves `box_blue` to square[1.5, 2.5].\n   - Agent[2.5, 1.5] moves `box_red` to square[1.5, 1.5] (but since `box_green` is already there, it should move to another adjacent square, let's say square[2.5, 0.5] or square[2.5, 2.5]. Moving to square[2.5, 2.5] is a better option as it is closer to the target_red).\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"}`\n\n3. **Step 3:**\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5] moves `box_blue` to square[2.5, 2.5] (since it's now at square[1.5, 2.5]).\n   - Agent[2.5, 2.5] (if it were there) or Agent[2.5, 1.5] (since it's the one moving box_red) moves `box_red` to square[1.5, 1.5] (but it's occupied by target_green, so it should go to another square, let's correct the path). Let's correct the path for `box_red`: Agent[2.5, 2.5] is empty, so Agent[2.5, 1.5] can move `box_red` to square[2.5, 2.5], and then Agent[2.5, 2.5] can move it further. However, a simpler step is for Agent[2.5, 1.5] to move `box_red` directly towards `target_red`, so it moves to square[1.5, 1.5] is not possible, so let's plan: move to square[2.5, 0.5] and then to [1.5, 0.5] and then to [0.5, 0.5].\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\"}`\n\n4. **Step 4:**\n   - Agent[2.5, 2.5] moves `box_blue` to `target_blue` (square[2.5, 1.5]).\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] moves `box_red` to square[1.5, 0.5].\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"}`\n\n5. **Step 5:**\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] (if it moves) or the agent that can move `box_red` further moves it to `target_red`. Let's say Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves to [0.5, 0.5].\n   - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}`\n\n### Step 3: Format the Action Plan in JSON\n\nLet's format the action plans into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n</answer> \n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 0.5]: I am in square[3.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 1.5]: I am in square[3.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 2.5]: I am in square[3.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

However, given the options, moving to square[1.5, 2.5] or square[0.5, 1.5] is considered.

The most direct path involves moving it right and then right again.\n\n3. **First Step Action Plan**:\n   - Move 'box_blue' from Agent[0.5, 0.5] to square[1.5, 0.5] because it's a step towards 'target_blue'.\n   - Move 'box_red' from Agent[0.5, 2.5] to square[1.5, 2.5] as it's a step towards 'target_red'.\n   - Move 'box_green' from Agent[1.5, 0.5] to square[2.5, 0.5] because it's a step that brings it closer to potentially being moved towards its target or being in a more central location for further planning.\n\n4. **Action Plan in JSON Format for the First Step**:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nLet's continue planning the subsequent steps based on the new positions after the first move.\n\nAfter the first step:\n- 'box_blue' is at square[1.5, 0.5].\n- 'box_red' is at square[1.5, 2.5].\n- 'box_green' is at square[2.5, 0.5].\n\n2. **Second Step Analysis**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] now has 'box_blue' and can move it to square[0.5, 0.5], square[2.5, 0.5], or square[1.5, 1.5]. Moving it to square[2.5, 0.5] is a good step towards 'target_blue'.\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5] now has 'box_red' and can potentially move it down towards 'target_red' at square[2.5, 0.5]. However, 'target_red' is at square[2.5, 0.5], so it should move towards it. The correct action is to move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 1.5] and then to square[2.5, 1.5] or directly towards 'target_red' if possible.\n   - Agent[2.5, 0.5] now has 'box_green' and can potentially move it to square[2.5, 1.5] or stay. Since 'target_red' is here, and there's 'box_red', we need to be cautious. 'box_green' should ideally be moved towards its target, but since 'target_green' is not visible, we should consider not moving it or moving it to a less congested area.\n\n3. **Second Step Action Plan**:\n   - Move 'box_blue' from Agent[1.5, 0.5] to square[2.5, 0.5].\n   - Move 'box_red' from Agent[1.5, 2.5] to square[2.5, 2.5] or towards 'target_red'. However, the direct path is blocked by 'box_green' and 'target_red', so it moves to square[1.5, 1.5].\n   - 'box_green' at Agent[2.5, 0.5] can be moved to square[2.5, 1.5].\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nLet's analyze further steps similarly.\n\nAfter the second step:\n- 'box_blue' is at square[2.5, 0.5] near 'target_red'.\n- 'box_red' is at square[1.5, 1.5].\n- 'box_green' is at square[2.5, 1.5].\n\n3. **Third Step Analysis**:\n   - 'box_blue' can be moved to square[3.5, 0.5] or square[2.5, 1.5]. It should move towards 'target_blue' at square[3.5, 1.5], so moving to square[2.5, 1.5] or directly to square[3.5, 0.5] is reasonable.\n   - 'box_red' can be moved towards 'target_red'. So, moving from square[1.5, 1.5] to square[2.5, 1.5] and then to square[2.5, 0.5] is a good plan.\n\n4. **Third Step Action Plan**:\n   - Move 'box_blue' from Agent[2.5, 0.5] to square[3.5, 0.5].\n   - Move 'box_red' from Agent[1.5, 1.5] to square[2.5, 1.5].\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nContinuing this process, we aim to match all boxes to their targets.\n\nThe final answer is \n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[3.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[2.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[3.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\n\n",

The agent can move box_green towards target_green.\n\n### Step 3: Create the Action Plan\n\n#### Step 1 Action Plan:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move box_red to square[1.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move box_blue to square[1.5, 1.5].\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] can move box_green to square[2.5, 1.5].\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 2 Action Plan (After Executing Step 1):\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] is now in a position to receive box_red. It doesn't have an action directly but will be involved in the next steps indirectly by being in the path.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] can receive box_blue and directly move it to target_blue.\n- Agent[2.5, 1.5] can receive box_green and directly move it to target_green.\n\nFirst, we need to get the boxes to the adjacent squares of their respective targets.\n\n#### Step 2:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] can now receive box_red from Agent[1.5, 0.5] (which got it from [0.5, 0.5]) and move it to target_red at [2.5, 0.5].\n\nLet's correct and simplify the steps:\n\n1. Move box_red from [0.5, 0.5] to [1.5, 0.5].\n2. Move box_blue from [0.5, 1.5] to [1.5, 1.5].\n3. Move box_green from [2.5, 0.5] to [2.5, 1.5].\n4. Then, move box_blue from [1.5, 1.5] to target_blue at [1.5, 1.5].\n5. Move box_green from [2.5, 1.5] to target_green at [2.5, 1.5].\n6. Finally, move box_red from [1.5, 0.5] to target_red at [2.5, 0.5].\n\nLet's format this into action plans:\n\n#### Step 1:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n  \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n  \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 2:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n  \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 3.5]: I am in square[1.5, 3.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])']\n\n",

Moving to [1.5, 2.5] brings it closer to the general direction of targets observed by Agent[0.5, 3.5].\n   - Move 'box_green' to square[1.5, 3.5] to get it closer to its target observed by Agent[0.5, 3.5].\n   - Move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 2.5] to get it closer to 'target_blue' in square[1.5, 1.5].\n\n### Step 3: Create Action Plan\n\nLet's create the initial action plan based on the observations and priorities.\n\n1. **First Step**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 1.5]: Move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 2.5].\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5]: Move 'box_green' to square[1.5, 3.5].\n   - Agent[1.5, 3.5]: Move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 2.5].\n\n   Action Plan:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"}]\n   ```\n\n2. **Subsequent Steps**: After the first step, we need to continue planning based on the new positions.\n\n- After the first step:\n  - 'box_red' and 'box_blue' are in square[1.5, 2.5].\n  - 'box_green' is in square[1.5, 3.5].\n\nLet's continue the planning process for the next steps.\n\n### Step 4: Continue Planning\n\n2. **Second Step**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5]: Move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' in square[1.5, 1.5].\n   - Agent[1.5, 3.5]: Move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 3.5] towards 'target_green'.\n\n   Action Plan for Second Step:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 3.5])\"}]\n   ```\n\n3. **Third Step**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 3.5]: Move 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\n   Action Plan for Third Step:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}]\n   ```\n\n4. **Fourth Step**:\n   - Move 'box_red' towards 'target_red'. First, move it to square[0.5, 2.5].\n\n   Action Plan for Fourth Step:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}]\n   ```\n\n5. **Fifth Step**:\n   - Continue moving 'box_red' towards 'target_red'. Move it to square[0.5, 3.5].\n\n   Action Plan for Fifth Step:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 3.5])\"}]\n   ```\n\n6. **Sixth Step**:\n   - Move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n\n   Action Plan for Sixth Step:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}]\n   ```\n\n### Final Action Plan\n\nCombining all the steps into a single list:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 3.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 3.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 3.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 3.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 3.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

The most direct path is to move it to square[1.5, 2.5] or square[1.5, 3.5] first.\n   - Agent[1.5, 2.5] has 'box_green' and can move it towards a potential target. However, we don't see a 'target_green' in the observations. Assuming it's not present or not observable, we'll focus on moving boxes to their respective targets or closer to them.\n   - Agent[1.5, 3.5] has 'box_blue' and there's 'target_blue' at square[1.5, 1.5]. So, 'box_blue' should be moved towards 'target_blue'.\n\n3. **First Step**:\n   - Move 'box_red' from Agent[1.5, 1.5] to square[1.5, 2.5] because it's on the path towards 'target_red' at square[0.5, 3.5].\n   - Move 'box_green' from Agent[1.5, 2.5] to square[1.5, 3.5] to make space and potentially move it towards a target if it were visible or known.\n   - Move 'box_blue' from Agent[1.5, 3.5] to square[1.5, 2.5], but since 'box_red' is being moved to square[1.5, 2.5], we need to adjust to avoid conflict. Let's move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 3.5] instead.\n\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 3.5])\"}]\n   ```\n\n4. **Subsequent Steps**:\n   - After the first step, 'box_red' is at square[1.5, 2.5] and 'box_blue' is at square[0.5, 3.5].\n   - 'box_blue' can now be moved to 'target_blue' at square[1.5, 1.5]. So, move 'box_blue' from square[0.5, 3.5] to square[1.5, 1.5] (though it's not directly possible, it can be done in steps).\n   - Let's correct and simplify the steps focusing on feasible moves.\n\n5. **Corrected Steps**:\n   - Step 1: \n     - Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to square[1.5, 2.5].\n     - Agent[1.5, 3.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 3.5].\n   - Step 2:\n     - Agent[0.5, 3.5] moves 'box_blue' from square[0.5, 3.5] to square[1.5, 3.5] (back to its original position, not optimal, let's adjust).\n     - Let's adjust: Agent[1.5, 2.5] moves 'box_red' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n     - Agent[0.5, 3.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 2.5] (if possible) or directly towards 'target_blue'.\n   - A more efficient plan would directly utilize the observable targets and boxes.\n\nLet's directly plan the actions based on the given observations and the rules.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 3.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 3.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 3.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 3.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3.

The closest target_red is at square[1.5, 0.5]. Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move box_red to square[0.5, 0.5], and then Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move it towards target_red.\n   - box_green is with Agent[0.5, 0.5]. It can be moved to target_green at square[1.5, 0.5] directly or after one move.\n   - box_blue is with Agent[1.5, 1.5] and target_blue is at square[0.5, 1.5].

Since it's a direct move to the target, it's efficient.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5] where 'target_red' is. However, 'target_red' is already at [1.5, 0.5], and there's 'target_green' there. So, we need to plan the moves carefully to avoid conflicts.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 1.5] where 'target_blue' is. However, 'target_blue' is already at [0.5, 1.5]. So, it's a potential direct move.\n\nLet's plan:\n- Move 'box_green' to 'target_green' at [1.5, 0.5].\n- Move 'box_red' to [1.5, 1.5] first because moving directly to [1.5, 0.5] might cause a conflict or not be possible due to the presence of 'target_green' and potentially 'box_green'.\n- Move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' at [0.5, 1.5].\n\nAction Plan for Step 1:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n  \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n  \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 2:\nAfter Step 1, the state changes:\n- 'box_green' is at [1.5, 0.5] with 'target_green'.\n- 'box_red' is at [1.5, 1.5].\n- 'box_blue' is at [0.5, 1.5] with 'target_blue'.\n\nLet's continue:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] (assuming it can now act as it's adjacent to 'box_green') can match 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] can now move 'box_red' to 'target_red' at [1.5, 0.5].\n\nAction Plan for Step 2:\n```json\n{\n  \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n  \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Compile the Action Plans\n\nThe sequence of action plans will be:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n\nNote that the exact JSON formatting might slightly vary based on the interpretation of the rules and the initial state.

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5.

So, one possible action is \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\".\n   - Alternatively, it could move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5] to match 'target_green'. So, another possible action is \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\".\n   - Let's prioritize 'box_red' over 'box_green' because it's one of the available choices and matches the rule of prioritizing matching boxes to targets in subsequent steps.\n\n4. **Subsequent Action Plans**:\n   - After moving 'box_red' to square[0.5, 2.5], Agent[0.5, 2.5] (if it could act) would ideally match 'box_red' with 'target_red'. However, Agent[0.5, 2.5] cannot act. So, we need to plan for Agent[0.5, 1.5] to move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5] next.\n   - Once 'box_green' is in square[0.5, 2.5], it can be matched with 'target_green'.\n   - Finally, 'box_blue' should be moved towards 'target_blue' in square[0.5, 3.5].\n\nLet's create the action plan step by step:\n\n### Step 1:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_red' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n\n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}\n```\n\n### Step 2:\n- Since Agent[0.5, 2.5] cannot act, Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n\n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}\n```\n\n### Step 3:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n\n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}\n```\n\n### Step 4:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' from square[0.5, 2.5] to square[0.5, 3.5] to match 'target_blue'.\n\n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 3.5])\"}\n```\n\n### Step 5:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] is not needed as it has finished its task.

          "full_model_response": "To create an efficient action plan, we need to analyze the given information and apply the rules provided.\n\n1. **Current State Analysis**:\n   - Agents are positioned across various squares.\n   - Agent[1.5, 0.5] is in a square with multiple targets (target_red, target_blue, target_green) but no boxes.\n   - Agent[1.5, 3.5] is in a square with multiple boxes (box_red, box_blue, box_green) and can perform actions to move these boxes.\n\n2. **Prioritizing Actions**:\n   - Since Agent[1.5, 3.5] has boxes and can move them, we should prioritize actions that match boxes to their targets.\n   - The closest target to Agent[1.5, 3.5] is presumably in square[1.5, 0.5] or adjacent squares, but since Agent[1.5, 0.5] is in square[1.5, 0.5] and has targets, we should plan to move boxes towards their respective targets.\n\n3. **Action Planning**:\n   - Agent[1.5, 3.5] can move boxes. Let's start by moving a box to its target. Since the targets are in square[1.5, 0.5], we should move boxes towards that direction.\n   - First, move a box to an adjacent square towards the target. For example, moving box_red, box_blue, or box_green to square[1.5, 2.5].\n\n4. **First Action Plan**:\n   - Let's choose to move box_red to square[1.5, 2.5] as the first action because it's a straightforward move towards the general direction of the targets.\n   - So, the first action plan could be: `{\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"}`.\n\n5. **Subsequent Action Plans**:\n   - After moving box_red to square[1.5, 2.5], Agent[1.5, 2.5] can potentially move it further. However, since Agent[1.5, 2.5] is not reported to have the capability to act on the box, we assume it needs to be in the same square as the box or the agent needs to move to the box.\n   - Let's assume Agent[1.5, 2.5] moves to square[1.5, 2.5] or acts on box_red if it were there. However, the initial report doesn't indicate its capability to act on box_red directly after it's moved.\n   - A more feasible next step involves continuing to move boxes towards their targets. So, the next action could involve moving another box towards the target or moving box_red further down.\n\n6. **Continuing the Plan**:\n   - Let's continue with moving box_blue to square[1.5, 2.5] or directly to a target if possible.\n   - However, since targets are in square[1.5, 0.5], we need to plan the moves carefully.\n\nGiven the constraints and the initial state, a simplified action plan could look like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nHowever, the above plan assumes capabilities and movements not directly stated in the initial conditions (like Agent[1.5, 2.5] and Agent[1.5, 1.5] acting on boxes). A more accurate plan based strictly on the given information and without assuming additional capabilities would be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"}\n]\n```\n\nLet's correct and simplify our final answer based on the information given and the format required.\n\n<answer>[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"}\n]</answer>\n\nHowever, to strictly follow the format and provide a list of action dictionaries as requested:\n\n<answer>[\n{\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\":\"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"}\n]</answer>\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>[\n{\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n{\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\":\"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"}\n]</answer>",

In Step 2, Agent[1.5, 2.5] is still not enabled, so let's directly move another box, say 'box_blue', to square[1.5, 2.5].\n     - Action Plan: `{\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"}`\n   - **Step 3 & onwards**: Continue this process. Once boxes are in square[1.5, 2.5], Agent[1.5, 2.5] can potentially be used or the boxes can be moved down to square[1.5, 1.5] and then to square[1.5, 0.5] where the targets are.\n\nLet's directly create a sequence of actions based on the given constraints and the objective to minimize moves.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 3.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_blue', 'target_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)']\n\n",

It can move 'box_red' to either square[0.5, 0.5] or square[0.5, 2.5].\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] has a 'box_green'.

It can move 'box_blue' to either square[0.5, 2.5] or 'target_blue'.\n\n2. **Prioritizing Actions**:\n   - The highest priority is to match boxes to their targets directly if possible.\n   - Agent[0.5, 3.5] can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' directly.\n\n3. **First Step Action Plan**:\n   - Since Agent[0.5, 3.5] can directly move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue', this action is prioritized.\n   - The other agents do not have direct matches, so we look at the next best action.\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' towards 'target_red' by moving it to square[0.5, 2.5] or square[0.5, 0.5]. Moving it to square[0.5, 2.5] brings it closer to 'target_red' at square[0.5, 3.5].\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 1.5] where there is a 'target_green', thus matching 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\n   So, the first step action plan is:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}]\n   ```\n\n4. **Subsequent Steps**:\n   - After the first step, 'box_blue' is matched with 'target_blue', and 'box_green' is on square[0.5, 1.5] where 'target_green' is located, so 'box_green' can be matched with 'target_green'.\n   - 'box_red' is now on square[0.5, 2.5].\n   \n   The state after the first step:\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] is now on square[0.5, 1.5] with 'target_green' and 'box_green', so it's empty and has no action.\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] is now empty and has no action.\n   - Agent[0.5, 3.5] is now empty and has 'target_red'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 0.5] is still empty.\n\n5. **Second Step Action Plan**:\n   - Agent[0.5, 1.5] can now match 'box_green' with 'target_green'.\n   - Agent[0.5, 2.5] has 'box_red' and can move it to 'target_red' at square[0.5, 3.5].\n\n   So, the second step action plan is:\n   ```json\n   [{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}]\n   ```\n\nSince 'box_red' is matched with 'target_red' and 'box_blue' is matched with 'target_blue' and 'box_green' is matched with 'target_green' after the second step, the task is complete.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n```",

The action is \"move(box_red, target_red)\".\n\nSo, the second action plan is:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}]\n```\n\nCombining these steps into a list of action plans as required:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\", \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]</answer>",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 3.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 3.5]: I am in square[1.5, 3.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 3.5]: I am in square[2.5, 3.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 0.5]: I am in square[3.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 1.5]: I am in square[3.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 2.5]: I am in square[3.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[3.5, 3.5]: I am in square[3.5, 3.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\n\n",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7.

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]).

Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4.

However, 'box_green' is still with Agent[1.5, 1.5] and 'target_green' is observed by Agent[1.5, 0.5].\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' to square[1.5, 0.5].\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4 (after Step 3 is executed):\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] now has 'box_green' and can move it to 'target_green'.\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nCombining these steps into a single list of action plans:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n```",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the current state of the grid and the actions available to each agent. We are given the status of four agents and their observable environment.\n\n1. **Agent[0.5, 0.5]**: This agent is in square[0.5, 0.5] with no observable boxes or targets and no available actions.\n2. **Agent[0.5, 1.5]**: This agent is in square[0.5, 1.5] with no observable boxes or targets and no available actions.\n3. **Agent[1.5, 0.5]**: This agent is in square[1.5, 0.5] and can observe 'box_red', 'target_blue', and 'target_green'. It can move 'box_red' to either square[0.5, 0.5] or square[1.5, 1.5].\n4. **Agent[1.5, 1.5]**: This agent is in square[1.5, 1.5] and can observe 'target_red', 'box_blue', and 'box_green'. It can move 'box_blue' or 'box_green' to either square[0.5, 1.5] or square[1.5, 0.5].\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current State and Available Actions\n\nFrom the information given:\n- 'box_red' is in square[1.5, 0.5] and 'target_red' is in square[1.5, 1.5].\n- 'box_blue' and 'box_green' are in square[1.5, 1.5]. 'target_blue' and 'target_green' are in square[1.5, 0.5].\n\n### Step 2: Plan the Actions\n\n1. **Move 'box_red' to 'target_red'**: Agent[1.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 1.5] where 'target_red' is located.\n2. **Move 'box_blue' or 'box_green' to their respective targets**: Since both 'target_blue' and 'target_green' are in square[1.5, 0.5] and 'box_blue' and 'box_green' are in square[1.5, 1.5], Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move one of the boxes to square[1.5, 0.5].\n\n### Step 3: Generate the Action Plan\n\n#### Step 1 Action Plan\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAfter this step, 'box_red' is matched with 'target_red', and 'box_blue' is moved to square[1.5, 0.5] where it can be matched with 'target_blue'. 'box_green' remains in square[1.5, 1.5].\n\n#### Step 2 Action Plan\nSince 'box_blue' is now in square[1.5, 0.5] with 'target_blue', Agent[1.5, 0.5] can match 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'. Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_green' to square[1.5, 0.5] to match it with 'target_green'.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 3 Action Plan\nNow, 'box_green' is in square[1.5, 0.5] with 'target_green', so Agent[1.5, 0.5] can match 'box_green' to 'target_green'.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Combining the Steps into a Single List\n\nThe final action plan is a list of these steps:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To create an efficient action plan, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Agent[0.5, 0.5]**: No boxes or actions available.\n2. **Agent[0.5, 1.5]**: No boxes or actions available.\n3. **Agent[1.5, 0.5]**: Has 'box_red' and can move it to 'square[0.5, 0.5]' or 'square[1.5, 1.5]'. There's 'target_blue' and 'target_green' in the same square, but 'box_red' doesn't match them.\n4. **Agent[1.5, 1.5]**: Has 'box_blue' and 'box_green'. 'target_red' is in the same square. Can move 'box_blue' to 'square[0.5, 1.5]' or 'square[1.5, 0.5]', and 'box_green' to 'square[0.5, 1.5]' or 'square[1.5, 0.5]'.\n\nLet's prioritize matching boxes to targets and optimize efficiency.\n\n### Step 1:\n- **Agent[1.5, 0.5]** can move 'box_red' to 'square[1.5, 1.5]' because 'target_red' is there, and it's a direct move towards matching 'box_red' with 'target_red'.\n- **Agent[1.5, 1.5]** has 'box_blue' and 'box_green'. It can move 'box_blue' to 'square[1.5, 0.5]' but there's no 'target_blue' there. However, it can move 'box_green' to 'square[1.5, 0.5]' as well. Since there's 'target_blue' in 'square[1.5, 0.5]', moving 'box_green' there is not optimal. Instead, moving 'box_blue' to 'square[0.5, 1.5]' is a better initial move because 'square[0.5, 1.5]' is empty and it's a start towards potentially matching 'box_blue' with a 'target_blue' if we knew its location.\n\nAction Plan:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 2:\nAfter Step 1, 'box_red' is in 'square[1.5, 1.5]' with 'target_red', so it can be matched.\n- **Agent[1.5, 1.5]** can now directly move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n- **Agent[0.5, 1.5]** is now in 'square[0.5, 1.5]' with 'box_blue'. It can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' if it were in an adjacent square or directly if 'target_blue' is in 'square[0.5, 1.5]'. However, we don't see 'target_blue' in 'square[0.5, 1.5]'. 'Agent[1.5, 0.5]' is in 'square[1.5, 0.5]' with 'target_blue', so 'box_blue' should be moved towards it.\n- **Agent[1.5, 1.5]** still has 'box_green'. It can move 'box_green' to 'square[1.5, 0.5]'.\n\nAction Plan Continued:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\nHowever, we need to adjust the second step because an agent can't perform two actions at once. Let's correct the steps and continue.\n\n### Corrected Step 1:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Corrected Step 2:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3:\n- Now 'box_blue' is being moved to 'square[1.5, 0.5]' where 'target_blue' is. So, 'Agent[0.5, 1.5]' can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n- 'Agent[1.5, 1.5]' moves 'box_green' to 'square[1.5, 0.5]'.\n\nLet's continue correctly:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4:\n- 'box_blue' and 'box_green' are now in 'square[1.5, 0.5]'. 'box_green' can be matched with 'target_green' if we move it appropriately.\n\nContinuing:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\nHowever, the last step has a conflict because 'Agent[1.5, 0.5]' can't perform two actions. Let's simplify and correct the final steps.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```",
