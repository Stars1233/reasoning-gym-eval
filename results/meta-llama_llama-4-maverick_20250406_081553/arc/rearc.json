      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this task, let's first analyze the given examples to identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\nIn the first example, the input grid is a 12x11 grid with a majority of the cells being '6'. There are two distinct patterns of different numbers: '8's forming a 2x2 square and '4's forming a 1x2 rectangle. The output grid retains the '8's and '4's in a shifted manner.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\nThe second example involves a 10x10 grid. Here, a '6' is isolated, and there's a 2x2 square of '8's. The output shifts the '6' down by one row and retains the '8's in their original position.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\nIn the third example, with an 8x12 grid, there are '4's and '5's. A '4' is shifted down, and '5's remain in their original position, with one '4' being affected by the presence of '5's.\n\n### Example 4 Analysis\nThe fourth example is a 12x12 grid. Here, a '4' is shifted up by one row, and '6's remain in their original position.\n\n### Identifying the Pattern\nUpon closer inspection:\n- In Example 1, the '8's stay in place, but the '4's move down by one row.\n- In Example 2, the '6' moves down, and '8's stay.\n- In Example 3, a '4' moves down, and '5's stay.\n- In Example 4, a '4' moves up, and '6's stay.\n\nIt seems that numbers different from the background are considered. If a different number is isolated or part of a singular occurrence, it tends to move. If it's part of a 2x2 square, it tends to stay.\n\nLet's refine this observation:\n1. **Background Value**: The majority or default value in the grid.\n2. **Distinct Values/Patterns**: Values different from the background.\n\nUpon a detailed review:\n- Isolated distinct values or singular occurrences tend to move vertically.\n- The direction of the move isn't consistent across examples; it depends on the grid's characteristics or the distinct value's position.\n\nLet's directly examine the changes:\n- Example 1: '8's (2x2) stay, '4's (1x2) move down.\n- Example 2: '6' (isolated) moves down, '8's (2x2) stay.\n- Example 3: '4's move down, '5's (2x2) stay.\n- Example 4: '4' moves up.\n\n### Rule Deduction\nThe rule seems to be:\n- **2x2 patterns of distinct numbers stay in place**.\n- **Isolated or non-2x2 distinct numbers tend to move**. The direction might depend on their position or the grid.\n\nLet's analyze the given test input grid with this rule:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nHere, '1's form a 2x2 square, so they should stay. '2' is isolated, so it should move.\n\nFollowing the observed pattern, '2' is expected to move. Let's see if it moves up or down.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n'1's (2x2) stay in place.\n'2' is isolated; let's consider the movement. If we follow the pattern of isolated numbers moving, '2' could potentially move up or down.\n\nGiven the examples, there's no clear direction for isolated numbers. However, if we look closely:\n- In Example 2, '6' moved down.\n- In Example 4, '4' moved up.\n\nLet's directly apply a potential rule to the test input:\nSince '1's are in a 2x2 pattern, they stay.\n'2' is isolated and could move either up or down. Let's consider moving it up as per Example 4's pattern for an isolated number.\n\n### Output Grid Prediction\nIf '2' moves up:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\nIn the first example, the input grid has a 2x2 sub-grid of 8s in the 7th row and a 2x2 sub-grid of 4s in the 10th row. The output grid retains the 2x2 sub-grid of 8s in the same position (7th row) but moves the 2x2 sub-grid of 4s up to the 9th row.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\nThe second example shows an input grid with a single 6 in the 3rd row and a 2x2 sub-grid of 8s in the 6th row. The output grid moves the 6 down to the 5th row and retains the 2x2 sub-grid of 8s in the same position (6th row).\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\nIn the third example, the input grid contains a single 4 in the 1st row and a 2x2 sub-grid of 5s in the 4th row. The output grid moves the 4 down to the 3rd row and retains the 2x2 sub-grid of 5s in the same position (4th row) but also seems to move a different number (4 in the 5th row) down.\n\n### Example 4 Analysis\nThe fourth example has a single 4 in the 1st row and a 2x2 sub-grid of 6s in the 3rd row. The output grid moves the 4 down to the 2nd row and retains the 2x2 sub-grid of 6s in the same position (3rd row).\n\n### General Rule Deduction\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that:\n- The 2x2 sub-grids with distinct numbers (like 8s, 5s, 6s) are generally retained in their original or slightly adjusted positions.\n- Single distinct numbers or smaller sub-grids not part of a larger pattern tend to move down.\n\nHowever, a more precise rule can be deduced by closely examining the movement of distinct numbers or sub-grids in each example.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n1. **Example 1**: The 8s stay, and the 4s move down one row.\n2. **Example 2**: The 6 moves down two rows, and the 8s stay.\n3. **Example 3**: The 4 moves down two rows, and the 5s stay.\n4. **Example 4**: The 4 moves down one row, and the 6s stay.\n\n### Common Rule\nUpon a detailed review, a simpler rule seems to apply: distinct numbers or sub-grids tend to move down, but the exact movement can vary. However, a clear pattern is that the distinct elements (not part of the dominant background number) tend to shift down.\n\nLet's re-evaluate with a focus on the position of distinct elements:\n- In Example 1, the 8s stay, and the 4s move down.\n- In Example 2, the 6 moves down two rows.\n- In Example 3, the 4 (in the first row) moves down two rows, and another 4 (in the fifth row) stays relatively in place or moves slightly.\n- In Example 4, the 4 moves down one row.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nThe test input grid is:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe distinct elements are the 1s (forming a 2x2 sub-grid) and the 2.\n\nFollowing the observed pattern:\n- The 2x2 sub-grid of 1s seems to stay in place based on previous examples with similar 2x2 sub-grids.\n- The 2, being a distinct number, might move down.\n\nThus, applying a similar logic:\n- The 1s stay.\n- The 2 moves down one row.\n\nSo, the output grid would be:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n</assistant<|header_end|>\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\nIn the first example, the input grid has a 2x2 sub-grid of 8s in the 7th row and a 2x2 sub-grid of 4s in the 10th row. The output grid retains the 2x2 sub-grid of 8s in the same position (7th row) but moves the 2x2 sub-grid of 4s up to the 9th row.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\nThe second example shows an input grid with a single 6 in the 3rd row and a 2x2 sub-grid of 8s in the 6th row. The output grid moves the 6 down to the 5th row and retains the 2x2 sub-grid of 8s in the same position (6th row).\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\nIn the third example, the input grid contains a 4 in the 1st row, a 2x2 sub-grid of 5s in the 4th row, and another 4 in the 5th row. The output grid moves the 4 from the 1st row down to the 3rd row, retains the 2x2 sub-grid of 5s in the same position (4th row), and moves the 4 in the 5th row down to the position that would be expected if following a pattern similar to the previous examples.\n\n### Example 4 Analysis\nThe fourth example has a 4 in the 1st row and a 2x2 sub-grid of 6s in the 3rd row. The output grid moves the 4 down to the 2nd row and retains the 2x2 sub-grid of 6s in the same position (3rd row).\n\n### Identifying the Pattern\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the rule involves shifting certain elements down by one or more rows. Specifically, for elements or sub-grids that are not part of a larger uniform background:\n- Non-background single cells or sub-grids are shifted down.\n- The position of the shift seems to be related to the presence of distinct values within a uniform grid.\n\nLet's directly examine the changes:\n1. **Example 1**: The 8s stay, and the 4s move up one row relative to their bottom edge.\n2. **Example 2**: The 6 moves down one row, and the 8s stay.\n3. **Example 3**: The top 4 moves down two rows (to the 3rd row), the 5s stay, and the lower 4 moves down one row.\n4. **Example 4**: The 4 moves down one row.\n\n### Rule Deduction\nFrom the examples, the rule seems to be that distinct patterns or numbers (not part of the uniform background) are shifted down by one row if they are not already at the bottom. If there's a number or pattern directly below another distinct number or pattern, the top one tends to move down.\n\nHowever, upon a detailed review, a simpler rule can be inferred:\n- The distinct elements or sub-grids tend to move down one row if possible.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n### Test Input Grid Analysis\nThe test input grid is:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe distinct elements are the 2x2 sub-grid of 1s and the 2.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n- The 2x2 sub-grid of 1s is in the 6th and 7th rows. According to the observed pattern, it should stay or move slightly. The exact behavior can be directly inferred from the examples.\n- The 2 is in the 7th row. It is distinct and should potentially move down.\n\nDirectly analyzing the given examples again for a clearer pattern:\n- The 1s (in the 6th and 7th rows) should stay as per Example 1.\n- The 2 (in the 7th row) moves down to the 8th row.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given examples to identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Example 1\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid is a 14x12 grid, and the output grid is a 10x6 grid. Upon closer inspection, we can see that the output grid seems to be related to the values in the input grid, particularly in how certain values or patterns are transformed.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Pattern in Example 1\n\nLooking closely at Example 1, the output grid contains a repeating pattern of \"0 0 5 0 5 0\" in most rows, with \"5 5 5 5 5 5\" in the second row and some other rows. It seems the output is not directly related to the numerical values in the input grid but rather to their positions or a specific pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Examine Example 2 and Example 3\n\nIn Example 2, the input grid is 12x13, and the output grid is 11x10. Here, the output grid has a pattern where most rows are \"9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9\" except for the second row, which is \"2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\".\n\nIn Example 3, with an input grid of 11x10 and an output grid of 6x8, the pattern in the output grid is mostly \"8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8\" with the fourth row being \"2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\".\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Common Rule\n\nUpon examining all examples, it appears that the output grid's pattern is related to the structure or specific elements of the input grid. However, the exact numerical values in the input grid do not directly translate to the output grid. Instead, the output seems to follow a pattern that is consistent within each example but varies between examples.\n\nNoticing the patterns:\n- In Example 1, the output alternates between \"0 0 5 0 5 0\" and \"5 5 5 5 5 5\".\n- In Example 2, it's mostly \"9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9\" with \"2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\" in the second row.\n- In Example 3, it's mostly \"8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8\" with \"2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\" in the fourth row.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Rule\n\nThe rule seems to involve creating a grid with a specific repeating pattern. The pattern and its dimensions are not directly derived from the input values but seem to be related to the input grid's dimensions or a specific characteristic of the input grid.\n\n### Step 6: Analyze the Output Grid Dimensions and Patterns\n\nThe dimensions of the output grids and their patterns suggest that the rule might involve a transformation that is not directly dependent on the input values but rather on their arrangement or the grid's dimensions.\n\n### Step 7: Apply the Observed Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input grid is 11x10, similar to Example 3, we might expect a similar pattern. The output grid in Example 3 is 6x8. If we follow a similar structure, we should look for a pattern that could apply to an 11x10 grid.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given examples again for a simpler pattern:\n- The output grids have a simpler pattern than the input grids.\n- The second row in Example 1 and the pattern in other examples suggest a uniform value for certain rows.\n\n### Step 8: Simplify the Analysis\n\nUpon reevaluation, notice that:\n- The output grids have a consistent pattern within themselves.\n- The pattern involves a dominant value or a simple alternation.\n\nLet's directly inspect the test input grid and apply a simplified rule based on observed patterns.\n\n### Step 9: Predict the Output Grid\n\nGiven that the exact rule is not straightforward from the numerical values, let's consider the structure and pattern observed in the examples.\n\nFor the test input grid (11x10), if we were to follow a pattern similar to Example 3 (since both have similar input dimensions), the output could be a grid with a similar structure to Example 3's output (6x8).\n\nLet's hypothesize the output grid could have a pattern like \"X Y X X X X X X\" for most rows and \"Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\" for one row, where X and Y are specific values.\n\nGiven the lack of direct correlation between input and output values, and considering the examples provided, a plausible approach is to look for a pattern that fits the output grid dimensions ( potentially 6x8 for an 11x10 input grid, following Example 3's structure).\n\n### Step 10: Finalize the Output Grid\n\nTo directly determine the output, let's consider that the rule might not be directly inferable from the given data without a clear pattern or additional hint towards the nature of the transformation (e.g., based on grid dimensions, specific cell values, etc.).\n\nHowever, if we follow the structure of Example 3, with an output of 6x8:\n```\n4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4\n```\nLet's directly apply a potential rule or pattern.\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nHowever, the above step-by-step process didn't directly lead to a clear, specific numerical answer following the exact format required for the output grid based on the examples given.\n\nLet's directly provide the answer as per the required format.\n\n<answer>\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n</answer>",

If we follow a similar structure, we should look for a pattern that could apply to an 11x10 grid.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given examples again for a simpler pattern:\n- The output grids have a simpler pattern than the input grids.\n- The second row in Example 1 and the pattern in other examples suggest a uniform value for certain rows.\n\n### Step 8: Simplify the Analysis\n\nUpon reevaluation, notice that:\n- The output grids have a consistent pattern within themselves.\n- The pattern involves a dominant value or a simple alternation.\n\nLet's directly inspect the test input grid and apply a simplified rule based on observed patterns.\n\n### Step 9: Predict the Output Grid\n\nGiven that the exact rule is not straightforward from the numerical values, let's consider the structure and pattern observed in the examples.\n\nFor the test input grid (11x10), if we were to follow a pattern similar to Example 3 (since both have similar input dimensions), the output could be a grid with a similar structure to Example 3's output (6x8).\n\nLet's hypothesize the output grid could have a pattern like \"X Y X X X X X X\" for most rows and \"Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\" for one row, where X and Y are specific values.\n\nGiven the lack of direct correlation between input and output values, and considering the examples provided, a plausible approach is to look for a pattern that fits the output grid dimensions ( potentially 6x8 for an 11x10 input grid, following Example 3's structure).\n\n### Step 10: Finalize the Output Grid\n\nTo directly determine the output, let's consider that the rule might not be directly inferable from the given data without a clear pattern or additional hint towards the nature of the transformation (e.g., based on grid dimensions, specific cell values, etc.).\n\nHowever, if we follow the structure of Example 3, with an output of 6x8:\n```\n4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4\n```\nLet's directly apply a potential rule or pattern.\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nHowever, the above step-by-step process didn't directly lead to a clear, specific numerical answer following the exact format required for the output grid based on the examples given.\n\nLet's directly provide the answer as per the required format.\n\n<answer>\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n</answer>",

The output grid seems to be derived based on a pattern or rule applied to the input grid.\n2. The size of the output grid is smaller than the input grid, suggesting that the rule might involve a transformation or a selection of specific elements or patterns from the input grid.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Pattern\n\nUpon closer inspection of Example 1:\n\n- The input grid is 12x14, and the output grid is 10x6.\n- The output grid has a repeating pattern of \"0 0 5 0 5 0\" in most rows, with the exception of rows that are all \"5 5 5 5 5 5\".\n\nLet's check if the pattern is related to the structure or specific values in the input grid.\n\n### Step 3: Checking the Rule Across Examples\n\nLet's analyze the other examples to confirm if there's a common rule.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n8 1 1 4 8 6 0 8 7 8 5 8 5\n7 7 2 4 8 0 6 8 2 5 2 6 6\n6 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 7\n5 9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 3 4\n5 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 7 4\n3 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 6 6\n8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 1\n8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 5\n8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 5\n7 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 7 6\n5 3 1 4 3 5 3 1 3 5 3 4 8\n```\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9 9 9\n```\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Common Rule\n\nAfter analyzing the given examples, it appears that the output grid is related to the presence of a specific pattern or value in the input grid, particularly focusing on a certain column or a block of values.\n\nUpon detailed examination, we can observe that the output grids seem to be highlighting or transforming the input data based on certain characteristics, such as the presence of a dominant value or a pattern in the input grid.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given grids:\n\n1. **Example 1**: The output seems to be related to the pattern observed in the input grid, particularly around the values that are zero or non-zero.\n2. **Example 2**: The output grid has a column with \"2\" and the rest are \"9\", indicating a possible relation to a specific column or pattern in the input grid.\n3. **Example 3**: The output grid has a pattern with \"8\" and \"2\", suggesting a relation to the dominant values or patterns in the input grid.\n\n### Step 5: Detailed Pattern Analysis\n\nUpon a detailed review, it seems that the rule could be related to the identification of a specific pattern or the dominant feature in the input grid.\n\nFor **Example 1**, the output grid seems to be related to the middle section of the input grid and the presence of zeros.\n\nFor **Example 2** and **Example 3**, a similar logic seems to apply, where the output grid reflects a certain characteristic or pattern observed in the input grid.\n\n### Step 6: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's directly infer the rule from the given examples:\n\n1. The output grid dimensions and values seem to be derived based on the input grid's structure and values.\n2. The rule appears to involve identifying a pattern or dominant feature in the input grid.\n\nGiven the input grid for the test:\n```\n3 2 3 2 7 7 1 7 9 6\n6 1 4 5 4 6 3 4 9 6\n1 4 6 6 4 8 8 9 4 3\n7 3 9 8 0 0 0 0 0 4\n4 4 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 2\n7 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 5\n4 4 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 9\n6 3 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 3\n5 7 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 6\n7 4 2 8 4 7 8 2 1 9\n```\n\nTo predict the output grid, let's analyze the given input grid:\n- The grid has a size of 10x10.\n- There's a clear pattern where the middle section (from the 5th column onwards for the first few rows) has zeros.\n\nLet's directly apply the observed pattern:\nThe output seems to be related to the pattern of zeros and non-zeros.\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n</answer>\n\nHowever, based on the closest match and simplification for this specific task:\n\n<answer>\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n</answer>\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n</answer>",

The '2' appears in the fourth column, and '9's and '2's are distributed in a column-wise pattern.\n   - In Example 3, the output grid has a pattern where the second column is '2', and the rest are '8's except for a row that is entirely '2's.\n\n2. **Common Rule**:\n   - Upon closer inspection, we can see that the output grid is related to the presence of a \"border\" or a \"frame\" of non-zero or specific values in the input grid.\n   - The rule seems to be related to identifying a certain pattern or value within the input grid and then transforming that into the output grid.\n\nGiven the input grid:\n```\n3 2 3 2 7 7 1 7 9 6\n6 1 4 5 4 6 3 4 9 6\n1 4 6 6 4 8 8 9 4 3\n7 3 9 8 0 0 0 0 0 4\n4 4 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 2\n7 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 5\n4 4 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 9\n6 3 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 3\n5 7 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 6\n7 4 2 8 4 7 8 2 1 9\n```\n\nLet's analyze it:\n- The grid has non-zero values on the edges and becomes zero in the center from the fourth row onwards.\n\nTo predict the output grid, we need to apply the observed rule:\n- The size of the output grid seems to be related to the input grid's dimensions. For an input grid of size MxN, the output grid's size varies but seems to be related to the area where the pattern or rule applies.\n\nLet's directly infer the rule from the given examples:\n- The output grid dimensions and values seem to be derived based on the pattern observed in the input grid, particularly around the transition from non-zero to zero values or a specific pattern.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nThe given test input grid is 11x10. Let's directly analyze the structure:\n- The grid starts having zeros from the 5th row (0-indexed: 4th row), indicating a pattern or rule might be applied around this area.\n\nLet's directly predict the output based on observed patterns:\n- The output grid for the given test input is expected to be a grid where certain values are repeated or follow a specific pattern based on the input grid's characteristics.\n\n### Output Grid Prediction\n\nGiven the complexity and the need to directly infer the rule, let's simplify by directly examining the structure of the examples and applying a similar transformation.\n\nThe output grid is:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nHowever, my explanation didn't directly lead to a clear rule, and the exact nature of the transformation isn't directly derived through the steps due to the complexity and variability of the examples provided.\n\nLet's directly provide the answer as per the required format.\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nis not directly derived.

      "best_full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\n- Input: `0 8`, `0 0`\n- Output: The first row is `0 8 0 0 0 0`, and the rest are zeros.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\n- Input: `4 0 0`, `0 0 0`, `4 0 0`\n- Output: The first and third rows start with `4 0 0`, followed by zeros. The rest are zeros.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\n- Input: `0 0`, `0 6`\n- Output: The second row starts with `0 6`, followed by zeros. The rest are zeros.\n\n### Example 4 Analysis\n- Input: `0 0`, `1 0`\n- Output: The second row starts with `1 0`, followed by zeros. The rest are zeros.\n\n### Example 5 Analysis\n- Input: `0 0`, `0 9`\n- Output: The second row starts with `0 9`, followed by zeros. The rest are zeros.\n\n### Common Rule Identification\nFrom the examples, we can observe that:\n- The output grid is always larger than the input grid.\n- The size of the output grid seems to be related to the size of the input grid.\n- In Example 1, the input is 2x2, and the output is 6x6.\n- In Example 2, the input is 3x3, and the output is 21x21.\n- In Examples 3, 4, and 5, the input is 2x2, and the output is 6x6.\n\nIt appears that the output grid size is determined by the input grid size. Specifically, for an n x n input grid, the output grid is (3n-0) x (3n-0) or simply 3n x 3n.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n- For a 2x2 input, the output is 6x6 (3*2 = 6).\n- For a 3x3 input, the output is indeed 9x9 if we strictly follow the 3n rule, but it's given as 21x21. This seems to be an exception or a different interpretation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the pattern with the given examples:\n- The first row or column of the output grid seems to be related to the input grid's first row or column, but more precisely, the non-zero values are placed according to the input grid's structure.\n\nFor a 2x2 input grid:\n- The output grid is 6x6.\n- The top-left value of the input grid is placed at (0,0) in the output if it's non-zero (Example 1).\n- If the bottom-left value is non-zero, it's placed at (1,0) in the output (Examples 4).\n- If the bottom-right value is non-zero, it's placed at (1,1) in the output (Examples 3, 5).\n\nThus, the rule seems to be:\n1. The output grid size is 3n x 3n for an n x n input grid.\n2. Non-zero values from the input grid are placed in the output grid in a specific pattern: the value at (0,0) in the input is at (0,0) in the output, and the value at (1,0) or (0,1) or (1,1) in the input is placed at the corresponding position in the second row or column of the output grid, shifted one position to the right or down.\n\nLet's directly apply the observed pattern to the test input grid.\n\n### Test Input Grid\nInput: `1 0`, `0 0`\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- Output grid size will be 6x6 because the input is 2x2.\n- The top-left value (1) is non-zero, so it's placed at (0,0) in the output.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n```\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n<answer>\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer> is replaced with the correct format as per the question.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

The output grid is always larger than the input grid.\n2. In Example 1, the input grid is 2x2, and the output grid is 6x6. The top-right value (8) from the input grid is copied to the top-left of the first row in the output grid.\n3. In Example 2, the input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 21x21. The top-left and bottom-left values (4) are copied to the corresponding positions in the output grid, maintaining their column and with a specific spacing.\n4. Examples 3, 4, and 5 show that the bottom-left value from the input grid is copied to the second row, first column in the output grid.\n\nObserving the pattern:\n- The size of the output grid seems to be related to the size of the input grid. Specifically, for an input grid of size NxN, the output grid is of size (N*3)x(N*3) or related to it.\n- Non-zero values from the first column of the input grid are placed in the first column of the output grid but shifted down by one row.\n\nLet's directly infer from the given examples:\n- For a 2x2 grid, the output is 6x6.\n- The top-right element is placed at the top row, second column in the output.\n- The bottom-left element is placed at the second row, first column in the output.\n\nGiven the input:\n1 0\n0 0\n\nApplying the observed rule:\n- The output grid should be 6x6 because the input is 2x2.\n- The top-right element (0) goes to the top row, second column.\n- The bottom-left element (1) goes to the second row, first column.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

The output grid is always larger than the input grid.\n2. In Example 1, the input grid is 2x2, and the output grid is 6x6. The top-right value (8) is copied to the first row of the output grid.\n3. In Example 2, the input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 21x21. The first column of the input grid is repeated in the output grid, maintaining the same spacing as in the input.\n4. Examples 3, 4, and 5 have 2x2 input grids and 6x6 output grids. The bottom-left value of the input grid is moved to the second row, first column of the output grid.\n\nLet's analyze further:\n- The size of the output grid seems to be related to the size of the input grid. For a 2x2 grid, the output is 6x6. For a 3x3 grid, the output is 21x21 (which is 7 times 3).\n- It seems that for an nxn input grid, the output grid is (3n-0)x(3n-0) or simply 3n x 3n, but the exact formula isn't directly derived from the given examples. However, we can infer that the output size is directly proportional to the input size.\n- Upon closer inspection, we see that for a 2x2 grid, the output is 6x6, and for a 3x3 grid, the output is 21x21. This suggests the output grid size is actually determined by a formula that isn't directly 3n. Let's directly examine the pattern of how input values are mapped to the output.\n\nFor the 2x2 input grids:\n- The top-right value is placed in the first row, second column of the output grid (Examples 1, 3).\n- The bottom-left value is placed in the second row, first column of the output grid (Examples 3, 4, 5).\n\nFor the given test input grid:\nInput:\n1 0\n0 0\n\nFollowing the observed pattern:\n- The output grid should be 6x6 because the input grid is 2x2.\n- The top-right value (0) is copied to the first row, second column.\n- The bottom-left value (0) is copied to the second row, first column.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHowever, re-examining the rule more precisely based on the given examples:\n- For a 2x2 grid, the output is 6x6.\n- The top-right element of the input is placed in the first row, second column of the output.\n- The bottom-left element of the input is placed in the second row, first column of the output.\n\nSo, for the input:\n1 0\n0 0\n\nThe correct output should be:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

The output is a 4x3 grid. The first row of the output contains the unique elements from the input grid in the order they first appear.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Example 2\nInput:\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n5\n2\n5\n4\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nOutput:\n2 5 4\n2 5 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n\nThe input is a 1x20 grid (or 20x1, considering it as a column).

The output is a 5x2 grid. The pattern continues: the first row of the output contains the unique elements from the input.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Example 4 and Example 5\nSimilar patterns are observed in Example 4 and Example 5, where the input grids are 5x3 and 4x4, respectively, and the outputs are constructed by taking the unique elements in the order they first appear and filling the rest of the grid with the first element and zeros.\n\n### Step 5: Identifying the Rule\n1. The output grid's first row contains the unique elements from the input grid in the order they first appear.\n2. The number of rows in the output grid is equal to the number of elements in the input grid (considering it as a single sequence, either row-wise or column-wise).\n3. The number of columns in the output grid is determined by the number of unique elements found in the input grid. If there are less than 3 unique elements, the output still has 3 columns if we consider the examples given; otherwise, it matches the count of unique elements.\n4. The first column of the output grid is filled with the first element of the input grid.\n5. The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.\n\n### Step 6: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nInput:\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n1\n4\n4\n4\n1\n9\n\n1.

The output grid will have 18 rows (since there are 18 elements in the input sequence) and 3 columns (since there are 3 unique elements).\n4. The first row will be: 4, 1, 9.\n5.

The first column of the output grid is always filled with the most frequent number in the input grid.\n2. The rest of the columns in the first row of the output grid are filled with the distinct numbers found in the input grid, excluding the most frequent number, in the order they first appear.\n3. The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.\n\nLet's verify this rule with the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Most frequent number is 2. Distinct numbers in order are 8, 9. So, the output should start with 2, followed by 8, 9 in the first row, and the rest filled with 2 in the first column and zeros elsewhere, which matches the given output.\n2. **Example 2**: Most frequent is 2. Distinct numbers are 5, 4. The output matches the rule.\n3. **Example 3**: Most frequent is 7. Distinct numbers are 9. The output matches.\n4. **Example 4**: Most frequent is 9. Distinct numbers are 4, 8. The output matches.\n5. **Example 5**: Most frequent is 3. Distinct numbers are 7, 4. The output matches.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\nInput:\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n1\n4\n4\n4\n1\n9\n\n1. **Most frequent number**: 4\n2. **Distinct numbers (excluding the most frequent) in order of appearance**: 1, 9\n\nSo, the output grid should be:\n- First column filled with 4.\n- First row: 4 (most frequent), 1, 9 (distinct numbers).\n\nThus, the output grid starts as:\n4 1 9\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n...\n\nLet's count the number of rows in the input grid to determine the number of rows in the output grid. There are 18 numbers, so the output grid should have 18 rows.\n\nThe output grid will be:\n4 1 9\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n\n<answer>\n4 1 9\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n4 1 9\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n4 0 0\n</answer>",

Specifically, the rule seems to involve shifting or replicating the non-dominant value(s) in a pattern.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given test input grid and apply a potential rule based on observations.\n\n### Test Input Grid\n```\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n```\nThe non-dominant value here is 2. Observing the examples, it seems the rule could be related to either moving or replicating the non-dominant value in a certain pattern.\n\n### Applying the Rule\nFrom the examples, a clear pattern is that the non-dominant value is often moved or replicated in a vertical or alternating pattern. Specifically, in Example 2 and Example 4, the non-dominant value is moved to the same column across all rows.\n\nFor the test input grid, if we follow a similar logic as in Example 2 and Example 4, we should look at how the non-dominant value (2) is distributed.\n\nGiven that the non-dominant value (2) appears in the 5th column in the second row and also in the third row, we might infer that the rule involves replicating or moving this value.\n\nLet's directly infer from the closest example (Example 2), where the non-dominant value (2) is moved to the same column across all rows.\n\n### Predicting the Output Grid\nIf we apply a similar rule to the test input grid, the non-dominant value (2) should be in the same column across all rows in the output grid. The column where 2 appears is the 5th column.\n\nThus, the output grid should have 2 in the 5th column for every row.\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n```\nLet's format it as per the required output.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n</answer>",

Specifically, the rule seems to involve placing the different value(s) in a specific pattern or column across the output grid.\n\nFrom the examples, we can observe:\n- The non-dominant value is moved or replicated in a pattern.\n- The pattern involves a specific column or alternating positions.\n\nLet's directly analyze the test input grid given:\n```\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n```\nThe non-dominant value is 2. Following the observed pattern, we need to determine how 2 is transformed.\n\nIn Example 2, the value 2 is moved to the fifth column across all rows. Let's apply a similar logic to the test input.\n\nGiven that the non-dominant value (2) appears in the last column in the second and third rows, we can hypothesize that it should appear in a consistent column across all rows in the output.\n\nLet's directly predict the output based on observed patterns.\n\n### Prediction\nIf we follow the pattern observed in the examples, particularly Example 2 where the different value is moved to a specific column across all rows, we can predict the output for the test input.\n\nThe test input has the non-dominant value (2) in the last column of the second and third rows. If we apply a similar transformation as in Example 2, the output should have 2 in the same column across all rows.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n```\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n```\n<answer>\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n3 3 3 3 2\n</answer>",

The value '1' is repeated from the third row onwards.\n\nFor **Example 2**, the central column (fourth column) has values 4, 3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 4 in the input and 4, 3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 4 (no change) in the output for that column, but other columns show a different pattern.\n\nFor **Example 3** and **Example 4**, similar observations can be made, but the key lies in understanding the pattern for each column or row.\n\n### Key Insight\n\nAfter re-evaluating, it appears the rule involves changing values in the grid based on a specific pattern related to their position, particularly for certain columns or rows.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given test input grid and try to apply a potential rule.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nGiven the input grid:\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n\nLet's predict the output based on observed patterns.\n\nIf we follow the pattern where certain values are repeated or changed based on their row or column index, we can start to see a potential rule.\n\nFor the given test input, if we observe the third column (which is the central column in this 5-column grid), the values are 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9. \n\nThe output for this column, following the observed pattern in **Example 1**, should potentially change to repeating the '9' from the third row onwards.\n\nThus, the output for the third column would be 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9.\n\nLet's apply a similar logic to other columns and observe the changes.\n\nUpon careful observation and trying to fit the given examples:\n- The rule seems to involve replicating or changing the middle or certain row values downwards.\n\nLet's directly infer the output for the given test grid.\n\n### Output Grid\n\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n</answer>",

Let's examine the changes more closely:\n\n1. **Rows with changes**: In all examples, it seems that the output grid is derived by modifying the input grid in a pattern that depends on the row index.\n   \n2. **Pattern in the examples**:\n   - In Example 1, rows 3, 5, and 7 have their original values copied to the output, with the middle element remaining '1'.\n   - In Example 2, the seventh row has elements at odd positions changed.\n   - In Example 3, the first, third, and fifth rows have elements at odd positions changed to the first element of their row.\n   - In Example 4, the third and fifth rows have their middle element ('9') preserved.\n\nLet's directly analyze the pattern:\n- For each row at an odd index (1-indexed), the elements at odd positions are changed to the first element of that row.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nInput:\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n\nLet's apply the identified rule:\n1. For the 1st row (odd index), change elements at odd positions to the 1st element: `7 0 7 0 7`.\n2. For the 2nd row (even index), no change: `0 0 0 0 0`.\n3.

However, a closer look shows that the central column and the values at certain positions are mirrored or changed. Let's analyze further.\n\n### Detailed Analysis Across Examples\n\n1. **Example 1**: Here, the output seems to replicate the input's pattern with a specific alteration. The central element and some others change.\n   \n2. **Example 2 & 3**: Upon closer inspection, it appears that the rule might involve changing certain elements based on their position.\n\nLet's directly compare input and output for a pattern:\n\n- In **Example 1**, the output grid takes the input grid and changes the middle row's central element (and others below it) to 1, effectively mirroring or changing values at certain positions.\n- In **Example 2**, a similar pattern is observed but with different numbers.\n- In **Example 3 & 4**, a similar rule seems to apply.\n\nUpon a detailed comparison:\n- For any grid cell at position (i, j), if we look at the examples, the output seems to be related to the input based on the cell's position.\n\nLet's directly examine the transformation:\n- The diagonal and certain other elements are either kept or changed based on a pattern.\n\n### Identifying the Pattern\n\nAfter analyzing the given examples, it seems that the rule involves modifying the grid based on the row and column indices.\n\nLet's directly analyze the change:\n- The elements on the grid that are on odd or even row and column indices seem to follow a certain pattern.\n\nUpon closer inspection of all examples, the rule appears to be that the output grid's elements are the same as the input grid's elements on certain diagonals or positions, but a clear, simple rule is:\n- For each cell, if the sum of its row and column index is even, it remains the same or is changed according to a specific pattern observed in the examples.\n\nThe pattern observed is that the grid is modified such that certain elements are kept the same, and others are potentially changed. However, a straightforward rule can be derived from observing that:\n- The first, third, fifth, etc., rows and columns tend to have a certain behavior.\n\nLet's directly check the examples again:\n- In all examples, the elements at positions where the row index is odd and the column index is odd (or even) tend to have a certain pattern.\n\nHowever, a simpler rule can be derived:\n- The output grid is generated by taking the input grid and applying a simple transformation based on the position.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the examples and directly infer the rule.\n\n### Rule Inference\n\nThe rule can be directly inferred as follows:\n- For any element at position (i, j) in the input grid, the corresponding element in the output grid is determined based on its position.\n\nUpon a detailed analysis, we can see that:\n- The output grid has the same values as the input grid for certain positions.\n\nLet's simplify the analysis:\n- Looking at the examples, the transformation seems to involve mirroring or changing certain elements.\n\nThe correct rule is that for each element in the grid:\n- If the row index is odd, the element is changed or remains the same based on a certain condition.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given test input grid and apply the observed pattern.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nInput:\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n\nLet's apply the rule that seems most plausible based on the examples.\n\nAfter analyzing the pattern in the given examples, the rule appears to be related to the symmetry or the pattern observed in the grids.\n\nThe output for the given test input grid, based on the observed pattern in the examples, is:\n7 0 7 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n\n<answer>\n7 0 7 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9\n</answer>\n\n<answer>7 0 7 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 9 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 9 0 9</answer>",

First row: All `7`s, so no change.\n2. Second row: All `7`s, so no change.\n3. Third row: `8 7 8 7 7 7 7`. The second `8` is replaced with `2`, resulting in `8 7 2 7 7 7 7`.\n4. Fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh rows: All `7`s, so no change.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the Output Grid\n\nApplying the identified rule:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n8 7 2 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n8 7 2 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>",

However, upon closer inspection, the change occurs at the second row's second element if we consider 1-based indexing.\n\nLet's directly examine the changes:\n- In Example 1, the element at (3,3) becomes 2.\n- In Example 2, the element at (2,2) becomes 2.\n- In Example 3, the element at (1,2) becomes 2.\n- In Example 4, the elements at (2,3) and (3,3) become 2.\n- In Example 5, the element at (3,2) becomes 2.\n\nUpon a detailed review, it appears the rule involves changing a specific element to '2', related to the occurrence of a different number in the neighborhood of the top or the changed element itself.\n\n### Step 7: Re-evaluate the Pattern More Closely\nUpon closer inspection, we see that the change to '2' occurs at the position that is directly below or related to the first occurrence of a different number in the input grid, specifically at the second column.\n\nLet's directly check the given test input:\nInput:\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n8 7 8 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nThe first different number is '8' at (3,1). The change occurs at (3,2).\n\n### Step 8: Apply the Rule to the Test Input\nFollowing the observed pattern, we need to change the element at (3,2) to '2'.\n\nOutput:\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n8 2 8 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n8 2 8 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>\n\n<answer>7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n8 2 8 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7</answer>",

For instance, in Example 1, the value `5` is dominant, in Example 2, it's `2`, and in Example 3, it's `3`.\n\n2. **Output Grid Pattern**: The output grids seem to follow a specific pattern based on the input grid's structure and values.\n\nLet's directly analyze the structure of the output grids:\n\n- **Example 1**: The output grid has a size of 11x9. It seems to be derived from the inner part of the input grid, focusing on the dominant value `5` and the pattern involving `1`s and `5`s.\n\n- **Example 2**: The output grid is 8x5. It appears to be related to the central part of the input grid, with a pattern involving the dominant value `2` and another value `5`.\n\n- **Example 3**: The output grid is 9x5, again related to the central part of the input grid, with a pattern involving `3` and `9`.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that:\n\n- The output grid dimensions are not directly the same as the input grid dimensions but seem to be related to the central or significant portion of the input grid.\n- The pattern involves the dominant value and sometimes another specific value.\n\n### Rule Application to Test Input\n\nLet's directly infer the rule based on the observed patterns and apply it to the test input.\n\nThe test input grid is:\n```\n1 0 2 0 1 9 1 7 0 9 8 3\n8 8 4 3 3 3 3 3 2 4 8 1\n3 4 9 3 3 3 3 3 0 9 3 9\n4 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 1 0 9 3\n8 3 1 3 3 9 3 3 2 4 5 8\n1 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 5 2 5 1\n1 2 8 3 3 3 3 3 0 4 2 4\n8 2 5 3 3 3 3 3 5 4 3 3\n2 8 2 3 3 3 3 3 9 4 7 1\n8 9 9 3 3 3 3 3 5 7 7 2\n7 0 8 7 0 1 5 8 0 5 3 2\n8 2 9 9 4 2 3 5 5 0 9 3\n```\n\nFirst, identify the dominant value in the test input grid, which appears to be `3` as it is repeated multiple times in the central part of the grid.\n\nThe size of the output grid in the examples seems to be related to the size of the input grid but is not a straightforward resize. Let's directly analyze the pattern:\n\nGiven the input grid size is 12x13, and observing the examples:\n\n- Example 1: 12x14 input to 11x9 output\n- Example 2: 13x10 input to 8x5 output\n- Example 3: 13x13 input to 9x5 output\n\nThe output grid size doesn't directly correlate with the input size in a simple manner. However, the output seems to be a transformed version focusing on the central or a significant pattern.\n\nLet's directly observe the test input grid and the pattern of `3`s:\n\nThe dominant value is `3`, and there's a clear central pattern involving `3`s. The output grid seems to reflect a pattern or a transformation involving this dominant value.\n\n### Applying the Observed Rule\n\nTo generate the output grid for the test input, let's follow the pattern observed:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be centered around the dominant value (`3` in this case).\n2. The pattern involves repeating the dominant value and sometimes another value in an alternating or specific pattern.\n\nLet's directly apply a similar transformation:\n\nThe test input has a dominant `3`, so we expect the output to involve `3` significantly.\n\n<answer>\n3 3 3 7 3\n3 3 3 7 3\n3 3 3 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7\n3 3 3 7 3\n3 3 3 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7\n3 3 3 7 3\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n3 3 3 7 3\n3 3 3 7 3\n3 3 3 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7\n3 3 3 7 3\n3 3 3 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7\n3 3 3 7 3\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n3 3 3 7 3\n3 3 3 7 3\n3 3 3 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7\n3 3 3 7 3\n3 3 3 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7\n3 3 3 7 3\n</answer>",

Following the observed pattern in the examples, we should look for an output that reflects a pattern related to `3`.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nThe size of the output grid seems to be related to the size of the input grid, but the exact dimensions are not directly proportional. Observing the given examples:\n- Example 1 has an input grid of 12x13 and an output grid of 11x9.\n- Example 2 has an input grid of 10x13 (if we consider the first and last row/column for size) and an output grid of 8x5.\n- Example 3 has an input grid of 13x13 and an output grid of 9x5.\n\nFor the test input grid of 12x13, if we follow a similar pattern or size reduction as in Example 1 (since it has a similar input grid size), we might expect an output grid of a similar size or pattern.\n\nThe output grid for the given test input, based on the pattern observed and the dominant value `3`, should alternate or have a pattern reflecting the dominant value.\n\nLet's directly infer or apply a simple rule based on the dominant central value `3` and the pattern observed in the examples.\n\n### Prediction\n\nGiven that `3` is the dominant value in the central region of the input grid, and following the pattern observed in the examples, we can predict the output grid.\n\nThe output should be:\n```\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n9 9 9 9 9\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n```\n\n<answer>\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n9 9 9 9 9\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n9 9 9 9 9\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n3 3 3 9 3\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the given examples to identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid is a 14x12 grid, and the output grid is an 11x9 grid. Upon closer inspection, we notice that the output grid seems to be related to the central part of the input grid.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Patterns in Example 1\n\nLooking at the input and output grids, the output grid appears to be a transformed version of a subset of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid has a repeating pattern related to the values in the input grid.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Analysis of Example 1\n\nUpon a detailed examination, we observe that the input grid has a large number of '5's in the central region. The output grid also predominantly consists of '5's and '1's. It seems that the output grid is derived by applying a certain rule to the corresponding elements in the input grid.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Rule\n\nBy comparing the input and output grids across the examples, we can see that the output grids are not directly copying values from the input grids but are instead applying a transformation.\n\n### Step 5: Observing the Pattern Across Examples\n\nIn all examples, the input grids have a distinct pattern or value in the central region that is reflected in the output grid. Specifically, for Example 1, the output grid alternates between '5' and '1'. For Example 2, it alternates between '2' and '5' or has a '5' when the corresponding input grid section has a '2'. For Example 3, the output grid has '3' and '9', with '9' being prominent at certain positions.\n\n### Step 6: Identifying the Common Rule\n\nUpon closer inspection, we notice that the output grid in each example seems to be related to the central \"box\" or \"pattern\" within the input grid. The output grids appear to be generated based on a checkerboard pattern or an alternating pattern.\n\n### Step 7: Detailed Rule Identification\n\nFor Example 1, the central part of the grid is filled with '5's, and the output alternates between '5' and '1'. For Example 2, the central part has '2's, and the output alternates between '2' and '5', with '5' at the center. For Example 3, with '3's in the center, the output has '3' and '9', with '9' at the center row.\n\n### Step 8: Generalizing the Rule\n\nThe rule appears to involve creating an output grid that alternates in value based on the position, with the values being related to the dominant or specific values in the central region of the input grid. The central row or column often has a distinct value.\n\n### Step 9: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input grid, we first identify the central region. The test input grid is 13x12, so the central region would correspond to an output grid of a certain size based on the observed patterns.\n\n### Step 10: Determining Output Grid Size and Values\n\nThe output grid size seems to be related to the dimensions of the input grid, potentially being a smaller grid that represents a transformed version of the central part of the input.\n\n### Step 11: Analyzing the Test Input Grid\n\nThe test input grid has '3's in a large central region, similar to the '5's in Example 1, '2's in Example 2, and '3's in Example 3.\n\n### Step 12: Applying the Observed Pattern\n\nIf we follow the pattern observed, the output should alternate between two values, with one of them being related to '3' (since '3' is the dominant value in the central region of the test input).\n\n### Step 13: Predicting the Output Grid\n\nGiven that the central region of the test input grid is filled with '3's, and following the pattern of alternation seen in the examples, we would expect the output grid to alternate between '3' and another value.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n</answer>\n<answer>\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n3 3 3 7 3 3 3\n</answer> is the solution.",

Specifically, `7` is a distinct value that appears in a certain pattern.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The output contains `4` and `3`, and `4` is a distinct value appearing in the input grid.\n\n4. **Example 4**: The output grid contains `0`, `2`, which are values present in the input grid.\n\nObserving the input and output grids:\n- The output grids seem to be derived from the non-uniform or distinct values within the input grids.\n- The dimensions of the output grids vary and seem to be related to the patterns or the number of distinct values in the input grids.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given test input grid and apply a potential rule based on observations:\n\nInput:\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7\n5 5 5 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7\n7 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n5 5 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n5 5 5 7 7 7 3 3 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 7\n\nThe distinct values in the grid are `8`, `5`, `3`, and `0`. The output grid seems to be related to these distinct values.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the task involves extracting a sub-grid or specific pattern related to the distinct or non-uniform values in the input grid.\n\nLet's directly examine the structure and distinct values:\n- The numbers `5`, `8`, `3`, and `0` are distinct and appear in a certain pattern.\n\nTo predict the output grid, let's hypothesize that the rule involves extracting or representing these distinct values in a certain format or pattern.\n\nThe given input grid has distinct values `5`, `8`, `3`, and `0`. Let's see if the output grid can be formed by representing these values.\n\nThe output for the test input grid is:\n```\n5 8 8\n5 8 8\n5 5 8\n7 0 7\n```\n\n<answer>\n5 8 8\n5 8 8\n5 5 8\n7 0 7\n</answer>\n\nLet's directly provide the final answer as per the required format.\n\n<answer>\n5 8 8\n5 8 8\n5 5 8\n7 0 7\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\nIn the first example, the input grid is an 11x11 grid, and the output grid is a 2x2 grid. The input grid has a specific pattern where the numbers 0, 4, 6, and 7 appear in a somewhat symmetrical manner. The output grid is:\n```\n3 6\n6 3\n```\nUpon closer inspection, it seems the output grid values correspond to specific numbers found in the input grid.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Example 2\nThe second example has a 12x12 input grid and a 4x2 output grid. The output grid is:\n```\n7 9\n9 7\n9 7\n9 7\n```\nHere, the numbers 7 and 9 appear in the output grid. Notably, 7 is a number that appears in the input grid, particularly in a column.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Example 3\nThe third example involves an input grid that is not square (12x15) and an output grid that is 4x3. The output grid is:\n```\n4 3 3\n3 4 3\n3 4 3\n3 4 4\n```\nThe numbers in the output grid seem to relate to specific values found in the input grid.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Example 4\nThe fourth example has a 12x12 input grid and a 3x5 output grid. The output grid is:\n```\n0 0 2 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0\n```\nThe values in the output grid directly correspond to specific numbers in the input grid.\n\n### Step 5: Identifying the Pattern\nUpon examining all examples, it appears that the output grid is derived from specific elements within the input grid. A closer look reveals that the output grid seems to be related to the values found in the input grid, particularly those that are different from the dominant background value.\n\n### Step 6: Detailed Examination\nLet's examine the positions and values in the input grids and their corresponding output grids more closely.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The output `3 6` and `6 3` seems to be related to the presence of specific numbers (like 4, 6, 7, and 0) in the grid. Notably, the numbers 6 and 7 are present in the grid, and their positions might be relevant.\n\n2. **Example 2**: The output involves the numbers 7 and 9. Here, 7 is a distinct number appearing in a pattern.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The numbers 4 and 3 (and 5) are relevant. The output grid contains these numbers, which are distinct in the input grid.\n\n4. **Example 4**: The output directly maps to the numbers 0 and 2, which are significant in the input grid.\n\n### Step 7: Observing the Input-Output Relationship\nUpon a detailed examination, it becomes evident that the output grid is constructed from the distinct or non-background values in the input grid. Specifically, the output grids seem to directly extract or represent certain patterns or values from the input grids.\n\n### Step 8: Applying to the Test Input Grid\nThe given test input grid is:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7\n5 5 5 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7\n7 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n5 5 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n5 5 5 7 7 7 3 3 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 7\n```\nThe distinct numbers here are 8, 5, 3, and 0. The pattern of these numbers seems to be crucial.\n\n### Step 9: Predicting the Output Grid\nBy observing the test input grid, the distinct numbers are 8, 5, 3, and 0. The numbers 5, 8, 3, and 0 form a pattern. If we look closely, the output might directly relate to the arrangement or presence of these numbers.\n\nLet's directly analyze the grid:\n- The number 8 appears in a 2x2 square.\n- The number 5 appears in a pattern that could be related to the output.\n- The number 3 and 0 are also distinct.\n\nThe output grid size isn't directly given, but based on the pattern observed in the examples, it seems the output grid could be related to the central or significant patterns in the input grid.\n\n### Step 10: Finalizing the Output Grid\nUpon careful observation and relating it to the given examples, it seems the task requires identifying a specific pattern or rule that applies to all given examples and then applying it to the test input.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need to directly infer the rule from the examples, let's simplify the approach by directly looking at the potential output based on the distinct elements (5, 8, 3, 0) in the test input grid.\n\nThe output grid is likely to be a representation or extraction of these distinct values.\n\n<answer>\n5 8 8\n5 5 8\n5 5 3\n7 7 0\n</answer>\n\nHowever, without a clear rule derived from the steps above and directly applying the observed patterns, the exact output grid size and values need to be inferred based on the distinct numbers and their patterns.\n\nLet's directly consider the pattern and the numbers involved.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>\n8 7 7\n5 7 7\n5 7 7\n5 7 0\n</answer>\n\nHowever, the correct interpretation based on the given examples and directly applying to the test grid should directly relate to the distinct numbers and their positioning.\n\nThus, the final output should be directly derived based on the observed distinct numbers and their patterns.\n\n<answer>\n8 7 7\n5 7 7\n5 7 7\n5 7 0\n</answer>",

Observing the positions of the non-'1' values in the output grid and their corresponding positions in the input grid, it appears that the top-left corner of the output grid is positioned at (6,6) if we consider the top-left corner of the input grid as (1,1).\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\nInput Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```\n0 4 4 0\n2 0 3 5\n2 3 3 5\n0 8 8 0\n```\nHere again, the output grid is a 4x4 sub-grid.

The top-left value of the output grid corresponds to the value at the position (3,3) in the input grid.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\nInput Grid:\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 5 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 5 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 9 9 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```\n1 3 3 1\n4 0 1 5\n4 1 0 5\n1 9 9 1\n```\nThe pattern continues; the output grid is a 4x4 sub-grid. The values in the output grid correspond to the values in the input grid starting from the position that captures the distinct or non-default values.\n\n### Common Rule Identification\nFrom the examples, the common rule appears to be extracting a 4x4 sub-grid from the input grid. The position of this sub-grid seems to be centered around the distinct or non-default values in the input grid.\n\nLet's analyze the starting position of the 4x4 sub-grid in the examples:\n1. Example 1: The top-left corner of the output grid is at (6,6) in the input grid (0-indexed: 5,5).\n2. Example 2: The top-left corner is at (3,3) (0-indexed: 2,2).\n3. Example 3: The top-left corner is at (7,7) (0-indexed: 6,6).\n\nUpon closer inspection, it seems the rule involves extracting a 4x4 grid around the \"center\" of the distinct values or patterns in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 9 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 9 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 0 7 7 2 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 0 7 7 2 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 4 4 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\nThe distinct values are centered around the area with values '9', '8', '0', '2', '4'. The \"center\" can be considered as roughly the position (4,4) or (5,5) when considering the grid's 0-indexed coordinates and the spread of distinct values.\n\nLet's directly identify the 4x4 sub-grid that corresponds to the output. By inspecting the grid, the relevant 4x4 sub-grid starts at (4,4) (0-indexed: 3,3).\n\nThus, the 4x4 sub-grid is:\n- Row 4 (0-indexed: 3): `7 7 9 7`\n- Row 5 (0-indexed: 4): `7 7 7 0`\n- Row 6 (0-indexed: 5): `7 7 7 0`\n- Row 7 (0-indexed: 6): `7 7 7 4`\n\nExtracting the 4x4 sub-grid:\n```\n7 9 7 7\n7 7 0 2\n7 7 0 2\n7 7 4 4\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n7 9 7 7\n7 7 0 2\n7 7 0 2\n7 7 4 4\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given examples and identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Structure of the Input and Output Grids\n\nFirst, let's examine the dimensions and structures of the input and output grids in the provided examples.\n\n- Example 1: Input grid is 12x14, and the output grid is 4x4.\n- Example 2: Input grid is 14x12, and the output grid is 4x4.\n- Example 3: Input grid is 15x14 (or 14x15, but based on the output, it seems to be treated as a square or near-square grid with some adjustments), and the output grid is 4x4.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Patterns in the Examples\n\nLet's analyze the given grids to identify any patterns or rules applied to transform the input grid into the output grid.\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis**:\n   - Input grid size: 12x14\n   - Output grid: \n     ```\n1 9 9 1\n7 8 1 5\n7 1 8 5\n1 2 2 1\n```\n   - The numbers 9, 9, 7, 8, 1, 5, 7, 1, 8, 5, 2, 2, 1 appear to be extracted from specific positions in the input grid.\n\n2. **Observing the Input Grid for Example 1**:\n   - Upon closer inspection, the output grid seems to be formed by extracting specific values from the input grid, particularly around the area where different numbers appear.\n\n3. **Common Pattern Across Examples**:\n   - For all examples, the output grid is 4x4.\n   - The non-uniform (different from the background) values in the input grid seem to be related to the output.\n\nLet's directly inspect the input grids and their corresponding outputs to identify how the values are being extracted or transformed.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Inspection\n\nUpon a detailed inspection of the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**:\n   - The output grid values correspond to specific non-1 values in the input grid.\n\n2. **Example 2**:\n   - Similarly, the output grid values are derived from non-0 (or non-uniform) values.\n\n3. **Example 3**:\n   - Again, the output is related to the non-uniform values.\n\n### Step 4: Rule Identification\n\nAfter analyzing the given examples, it appears that the rule involves extracting a 4x4 sub-grid from the input grid that contains the \"anomalies\" or non-uniform values relative to the background.\n\nLet's directly compare the positions of the non-uniform values in the input grids to their corresponding outputs.\n\nFor Example 1, the anomalies are around the 6th and 7th rows and 8th to 10th columns. Focusing on this area:\n- The values (9, 9), (7, 8), (7, 1), (8, 5), (1, 2), (2, 1) are extracted and arranged into a 4x4 grid.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 9 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 9 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 0 7 7 2 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 0 7 7 2 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 4 4 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\nThe anomalies are around the 3rd to 7th rows and 3rd to 8th columns. Specifically, the values are:\n- 9, 9 (3rd row, 3rd column and 4th row, 4th column)\n- 8, 8 (4th row, 6th and 7th columns)\n- 0, 0 (5th and 6th rows, 5th column)\n- 2, 2 (5th and 6th rows, 8th column)\n- 4, 4 (7th row, 6th and 7th columns)\n\nFocusing on the area around these anomalies, we can see the relevant values are:\n- Top-left anomaly: 9\n- Other values around it: 9, 8, 8\n- Below that: 0, 7, 2\n- And the values: 0, 7, 2\n- Then: 4, 4\n\nLet's directly form the output grid based on observed patterns in the examples.\n\nThe output grid, based on the pattern observed, should be:\n```\n7 9 9 7\n7 0 8 8\n7 0 8 2\n7 4 4 7\n```\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection and matching the pattern with the given examples, the correct extraction should directly relate to how the anomalies are positioned and extracted.\n\n<answer>\n9 9 8 8\n0 7 7 2\n0 7 7 2\n4 4 7 7\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n9 9 8 8\n0 7 7 2\n0 7 7 2\n4 4 7 7\n</answer> is not directly derived; let's directly infer from given data.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n7 9 9 7\n7 0 8 2\n7 0 2 8\n7 4 4 7\n</answer>",

Observing the input grid, the non-uniform values start appearing from the 6th row onwards. The output grid appears to be centered around the non-uniform values.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the top-left corner of the output grid corresponds to the (6-3, 9-3) = (3, 6) position in the input grid if we consider 0-based indexing and the center of the output grid being around the first occurrence of non-uniform values (9, 9). However, a more systematic approach is needed.\n\n### General Analysis\n\nLet's directly compare the input and output grids from all examples to identify a pattern.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The output grid is a 4x4 grid. If we look at the input grid, the values that are not '1' start from the 6th row and 9th column (0-indexed: 5, 8). The output grid seems to capture a 4x4 sub-grid around these non-'1' values.\n\n2. **Example 2**: Similarly, the non-'0' values are centered, and the output grid captures a 4x4 sub-grid around these values.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Again, the output grid is a 4x4 sub-grid that seems to be centered around the non-uniform values.\n\nLet's analyze the positions:\n\n- **Example 1**: Non-'1' values start around (5,8), and the output grid is from (5-3 to 5+0) rows and (8-3 to 8+0) columns, i.e., rows 2-5 and columns 5-8 (0-indexed: 2-5, 5-8).\n\n- **Example 2**: Non-'0' values are around (1,1) and (3,3), and the output is from (3,3) as a center, considering rows 2-5 and columns 2-5 (0-indexed).\n\n- **Example 3**: The pattern continues.\n\nUpon a detailed examination, we can observe that the output grid is a 4x4 grid that is extracted from a specific position in the input grid. The extraction point seems to be related to the positioning of the non-uniform values.\n\n### Rule Identification\n\nThe rule appears to be extracting a 4x4 sub-grid. To identify the exact rule, let's directly inspect the relation between input and output grids.\n\nFor **Example 1**, the top-left value '1' in the output grid corresponds to the value at the position (6-3, 9-3) = (3, 6) in the 0-indexed input grid. However, a simpler way to look at it is to directly check the starting point of the 4x4 grid in the input.\n\nLet's directly analyze the starting position for the 4x4 grid in each example.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The 4x4 grid starts at (5, 8) if we count from the top-left as (0,0).\n2. **Example 2**: The 4x4 grid starts at (2, 2).\n3. **Example 3**: The 4x4 grid starts at (6, 7).\n\nHowever, a more straightforward observation is needed.\n\n### Simplified Rule\n\nUpon closer inspection of the examples, we can observe that the output grid is a 4x4 sub-grid that is extracted from the input grid. The top-left corner of this sub-grid seems to be positioned at a certain offset from the top-left corner of the input grid.\n\nLet's directly check the offset for the given examples.\n\nFor the test input grid:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 9 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 9 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 0 7 7 2 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 0 7 7 2 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 4 4 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\nThe non-'7' values start appearing from the 3rd row and 4th column (0-indexed: 2, 3). If we follow a similar pattern as observed, the output grid should be a 4x4 sub-grid around these non-'7' values.\n\nLet's directly apply the observed pattern to the test input.\n\nThe first non-'7' is at (2, 2) (for '9'), and other non-'7's follow. A 4x4 grid around these values would start at (3, 3) (since the grid is 4x4 and we need to capture the values around the non-'7's).\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n```\n7 7 8 8\n7 0 7 2\n7 0 7 2\n7 4 4 7\n```\n\nLet's format it as required.\n\n<answer>\n7 7 8 8\n7 0 7 2\n7 0 7 2\n7 4 4 7\n</answer>\n\n<answer>7 7 8 8\n7 0 7 2\n7 0 7 2\n7 4 4 7</answer>",

In the output grid, the last two elements of the 4th column are replicated across all rows.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 3 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n7 7 7 7 3 7\n7 7 7 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 3 7\n7 7 7 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 3 7\n7 7 7 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 3 7\n7 7 7 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 3 7\n7 7 7 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 3 7\n7 7 7 8 7 7\n```\n\nThe non-zero distinct values (8 and 3) are at the 6th and 7th rows. The output grid alternates between the last column of the 7th row (7 3 7) and the last column of the 6th row (7 8 7) for each row.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n```\n\nHere, the non-zero value (3) is in the 2nd and 3rd rows. The output grid replicates the 5th column across all rows.\n\n### Common Rule Identification\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the rule involves replicating a specific column across all rows in the output grid. The column to be replicated seems to be related to the position of the non-zero or distinct values in the input grid.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The 4th row has non-zero values, and the last two elements of that row are not directly replicated. Instead, the column where the non-zero values are (4th and 5th columns) seems to be the focus. The output grid replicates the 4th and 5th columns' values (5 and 9) across all rows.\n\n2. **Example 2**: The distinct non-zero values are in the 6th and 7th rows. The output grid seems to alternate between the values in the last column of these rows.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The non-zero value is in the 2nd and 3rd rows, and the 5th column is replicated.\n\nUpon further analysis, the rule seems to be related to replicating a column that contains a non-default (non-zero or distinct) value. \n\nFor **Example 1**, it's the column with the non-zero value (5) that gets replicated along with its adjacent value (9).\n\nFor **Example 2** and **Example 3**, the rule isn't directly about replication of a single column but involves the column with the distinct or non-zero value.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nTest Input Grid:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\nThe non-default value (6) appears in the 4th and 5th rows, in the 6th column.

Following the observed pattern in Example 2, where the output alternates between the rows containing distinct values, we can apply a similar logic.\n\nThe rows with distinct values are the 4th and 5th rows. \n\nThus, the output grid should alternate between the 4th and 5th rows.\n\n4th Row: `7 7 7 7 7 6`\n5th Row: `7 7 7 7 7 6`\n\nSince both rows are the same, the output grid will be the same for all rows.\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n```\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\n- Input grid has a size of 9x5.\n- The output grid is also 9x5.\n- The input grid has non-zero values (5 and 9) at the position (3,4) and (3,5) if we consider 0-based indexing and the grid as a matrix.\n- The output grid replicates the row (0, 0, 0, 5, 9) across all its rows.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\n- Input grid is 13x6.\n- The output grid is also 13x6.\n- Non-zero or distinct values in the input are 8 at (5,4) and 3 at (6,5) if we consider 0-based indexing.\n- The output grid alternates between the rows (7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 7) and (7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7).\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\n- Input grid is 9x6.\n- The output grid is also 9x6.\n- The distinct non-zero value 3 is at positions (1,5) and (2,5).\n- The output grid replicates the row (0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0) across all its rows.\n\n### Common Rule Identification\nFrom the examples, it seems that:\n- In Example 1, the output is generated by replicating the row that contains the non-zero values (or the last row with non-zero values if there are multiple).\n- In Example 2, the output alternates between two specific rows that contain distinct or non-zero values.\n- In Example 3, similar to Example 1, the output is generated by replicating a specific row that contains non-zero values.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can observe:\n- Example 1 replicates the 4th row (0-indexed, so it's the row with the non-zero values).\n- Example 2 alternates between the 7th row and the 6th row, which are the rows containing the distinct values 8 and 3, respectively.\n- Example 3 replicates the 2nd row (or the row with non-zero value 3).\n\n### Rule Formulation\nThe rule appears to involve replicating or alternating based on rows that contain distinct or non-zero values. Specifically, for grids where there's a single row with distinct values, that row is replicated. For grids with more than one row having distinct values, it seems to alternate between specific rows related to these distinct values.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nThe test input grid is 10x6. It has non-zero or distinct values (6) at positions (3,6) and (4,6) if we consider 0-based indexing and the grid as a matrix, but since the grid is 10x6, the column index 6 is out of bounds. Correctly, the values are at (3,5) and (4,5).\n\nFollowing the observed pattern:\n- The distinct value 6 is in the 4th and 5th rows.\n- The output should alternate between the 4th row (7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6) and the 5th row (7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6), which are the same.\n\nThus, the output grid should replicate the row (7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6) across all its rows because both rows with the distinct value are the same.\n\n### Output Grid\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n7 7 7 7 7 6\n</answer>",

Let's look closer at the structure and values.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1**: The input grid is 8x10 (if we consider the given numbers), but the output is 6x4. Let's directly check the values.\n   - The top-left value of the output grid is the same as the top-left value of the input grid (3).\n   - The output grid seems to be extracting or transforming values from the input grid in a specific pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Upon closer inspection, we notice that the output grid values correspond to specific positions in the input grid.\n   - Let's analyze the positions of the elements in the output grid and their corresponding values in the input grid.\n\n### General Rule\n\nAfter analyzing the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**:\n   - Output[0,0] = Input[0,0] = 3\n   - Output[0,1] = Input[0,3] = 6\n   - Output[0,2] = Input[0,7] = 0\n   - Output[0,3] = Input[1,7] = 5 (but output is 6, which is Input[2,7])\n   - It seems there's a pattern in selecting values from the input grid.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given examples to deduce the rule:\n\n- The output grid seems to be related to the diagonal or cross-diagonal elements of the input grid.\n\n### Specific Rule\n\nUpon a detailed examination, it appears that the rule involves extracting elements from the input grid to form the output grid.

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given examples and identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Structure of the Input and Output Grids\n\nFirst, let's examine the dimensions of the input and output grids in the provided examples to identify any patterns.\n\n- Example 1: Input is 10x8, Output is 6x4.\n- Example 2: Input is 6x6, Output is 2x2.\n- Example 3: Input is 8x10, Output is 4x6.\n- Example 4: Input is 6x6, Output is 2x2.\n- Example 5: Input is 11x10, Output is 6x6.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Pattern in Grid Dimensions\n\nFrom the examples, we can observe that the output grid dimensions are not directly proportional to the input grid dimensions. However, let's check if there's a pattern in how the output grid is extracted or transformed from the input grid.\n\n### Step 3: Examining the Content of the Input and Output Grids\n\nLet's analyze the content:\n- In Example 1, the output seems to be related to the values at specific positions in the input grid.\n- Upon closer inspection, we can see that the output grid values correspond to specific elements in the input grid.\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Analysis of Example 1\n\nFor Example 1:\n- Input: 10x8 grid\n- Output: 6x4 grid\nLet's map the output grid values to their corresponding positions in the input grid.\n\nOutput grid values are:\n3, 6, 0, 6,\n6, 6, 0, 6,\n6, 6, 6, 6,\n4, 6, 7, 7,\n6, 6, 6, 6,\n6, 4, 6, 6.\n\nCorresponding input grid positions are:\n(1,1), (1,3), (1,8), (2,3),\n(3,1), (3,3), (3,8), (4,3),\n(5,1), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5),\n(10,1), (10,3), (10,8), (10,7)  - Corrected to (9,7) and (10,8) for last row,\n(6,1), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5),\n(7,1), (7,2), (7,4), (7,5).\n\nHowever, a more systematic approach is needed.\n\n### Step 5: Checking for Patterns Across Examples\n\nUpon a detailed review, it appears that the output grid is formed by taking elements from the input grid at specific positions. Let's directly analyze the pattern.\n\nFor each example, let's directly compare the input and output:\n- The output seems to be related to the corners and specific patterns within the grid.\n\n### Step 6: Observing the Pattern\n\nAfter analyzing the given examples, it seems the rule involves extracting specific elements from the input grid to form the output grid. The exact positions are related to the grid's structure.\n\nLet's directly inspect the given grids:\n- The first and last rows and columns of the output grid seem to be related to the corresponding elements in the input grid.\n\n### Step 7: Applying the Observed Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply the observed pattern to the test input grid:\n7 1 9 9 9 9 1 6\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n9 1 0 9 0 9 1 9\n9 1 9 0 9 0 1 9\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n5 1 9 9 9 9 1 8\n\nThe dimensions of the input grid are 6x8. If we follow a similar pattern as observed, we should get a 4x4 or a similarly sized output grid based on the rule.\n\nLet's directly check the values:\n- Output grid values are taken from specific positions.\n\n### Step 8: Detailed Calculation for Test Input\n\nTo predict the output grid, we need to understand that the output grid is derived from the diagonal or specific pattern elements of the input grid or its corners and middle elements.\n\nFor the given test input:\n7 1 9 9 9 9 1 6\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n9 1 0 9 0 9 1 9\n9 1 9 0 9 0 1 9\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n5 1 9 9 9 9 1 8\n\nLet's directly apply a potential rule that fits all examples.\n\nUpon closer inspection of the examples, the rule appears to involve taking elements from the input grid in a pattern that relates to its diagonals or specific positional values.\n\nThe output for the test input grid, based on the observed pattern in the examples provided, is:\n7 9 1 6\n5 9 1 8\n5 9 1 8\n7 6 1 6\n\nLet's directly verify:\n<answer>\n7 6 1 6\n5 8 1 8\n5 9 1 8\n7 6 1 6\n</answer>\n\nHowever, my analysis directly leads to the final output.\n\n<answer>\n7 6 1 6\n5 8 1 8\n5 9 1 8\n7 6 1 6\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Example 1\nIn Example 1, the input grid is a 7x10 grid with a specific pattern, and the output grid is also a 7x10 grid. Upon closer inspection, we can see that the output grid is almost entirely filled with the value 2, except for the last row where the middle elements are 3, corresponding to the inner pattern in the input grid. However, a simpler observation is that the output grid retains the value of the input grid at certain positions and fills the rest with a dominant value.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Example 2\nIn Example 2, the input is an 8x7 grid. Here, the output grid has the same outer border as the input, but the inner part is filled with the value 1, which is the value of the outer border of the input grid. Specifically, the inner grid values (4) are replaced by the border value (1).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Example 3\nExample 3 presents a similar pattern to Example 1. The output grid has the same value as the input grid at the bottom row for the inner section (4), and the rest is filled with the dominant value (6).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Example 4\nIn Example 4, the input is an 8x4 grid. The output grid retains the structure of having the outer border as 7 (the dominant input value), and the inner values are replaced.

Specifically, the rule seems to involve replacing most of the grid with the dominant border value or a dominant value present in the grid, except for a specific pattern or value that is retained from the input.\n\n### Step 7: Detailed Observation\nA closer look reveals that the last row of the output grid often reflects a part of the input grid's inner or distinct pattern. For instance, in Example 1, the last row has 3s corresponding to the inner 3s in the input. In Example 3, the last row has 4s where the input had 4s. This suggests that the rule might involve copying a part of the input grid's pattern to the output grid, particularly in the last row or certain significant positions.\n\n### Step 8: Apply the Observed Rule to the Test Input\nThe test input grid is a 6x8 grid with 7s and 8s.

The changes seem to propagate or relate to the distinct inner grid values or patterns.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that the rule involves changing the second last row to match the pattern or value of the surrounding or dominant value except for the distinct inner grid value if present.\n\nLet's directly apply a simplified observation:\n- The second last row of the input grid is modified in the output grid.\n\n### Test Input Grid Analysis\nGiven Input Grid:\n```\n7 7 8 8 8 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\nTo predict the output grid, we need to apply the observed rule.\n\n1. Identify the second last row: `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7`.\n2. The dominant value around the distinct inner grid ('8') is '7'. The second last row should change to '7' except potentially for a pattern related to '8'.\n\nApplying the rule: The second last row becomes `7 7 7 8 8 8 8 7` because it seems to adopt the pattern related to the distinct value ('8') in its original position.\n\nThus, the predicted Output Grid is:\n```\n7 7 8 8 8 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 8 8 8 8 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n7 7 8 8 8 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 8 8 8 8 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\nInput Grid:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 2\n```\nThe change occurs in the last row where the values change to match the pattern above it but with a specific alteration.\n\n### General Analysis Across Examples\nLet's examine the pattern across all given examples to identify a common rule.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The output is mostly uniform with the value '2', except for the last row where it reflects a change related to the input grid's distinct region.\n2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a '4' region surrounded by '1's. The output grid changes the '4' region to '1' except for the leftmost column of '4's, which remains '4'.\n3. **Example 3**: Similar to Example 1, the output grid is uniform with '6', except for the last row, which reflects a pattern change related to the '4' region in the input.\n4. **Example 4**: The '5' region in the input grid affects the output grid by appearing in the corresponding position but shifted.\n5. **Example 5**: The '6' region in the input grid is reflected in the output grid at a specific position.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that in each example, the output grid is largely uniform with the dominant value from the input grid. The exceptions or changes in the output grid seem to relate to the less dominant or distinct regions in the input grid.\n\n### Key Observation\nA key observation is that the distinct or less dominant region in the input grid influences the output grid in a specific manner. Notably, the change often occurs in a way that seems to \"lift\" or reflect the distinct pattern or value into the output grid, often with a transformation or shift.\n\n### Identifying the Rule\nUpon analyzing the examples, it becomes apparent that the rule involves:\n1. Filling the output grid with the dominant value from the input grid.\n2. Reflecting or adjusting the less dominant or distinct region's influence in the output grid, often in a manner that involves a positional shift or transformation.\n\n### Specific Rule\nThe specific rule that seems to apply across the examples is that the output grid takes the dominant color/value of the input grid and fills most of it with this value. The last row (or sometimes a specific row/column related to the distinct region) of the output grid reflects the pattern or influence of the less dominant region or distinct pattern from the input grid.\n\nLet's directly apply a simplified version of this observation to the given test input grid.\n\n### Test Input Grid\n```\n7 7 8 8 8 8 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\nThe dominant value is '7'. The distinct region is '8'.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n1. Fill the output grid with '7'.\n2. The last row of the output should reflect the influence of '8'.\n\nThus, the output grid should be filled with '7's, and the last row should have '8's where '8' was present in the input grid's corresponding position.\n\n### Output Grid\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 8 8 8 8 7 7\n```\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 8 8 8 8 7 7\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 8 8 8 8 7 7\n</answer>",

The output grid ignores the alteration and retains the original pattern outside the altered section.\n   \n2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the input grid has an alteration in the middle section with different numbers. The output grid again ignores this alteration and follows the original pattern.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The alteration is again in the middle section but with different numbers. The output grid retains the original pattern.\n\n4. **Example 4**: The input grid has an alteration towards the right-middle section. The output grid retains the original pattern, ignoring the alteration.\n\n5. **Example 5**: The alteration is in two different sections. The output grid changes the altered sections to follow a consistent pattern seen in the original grid before alteration.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the rule involves ignoring or correcting the alterations made in the input grid to match a certain pattern. Specifically, the output grids seem to be \"correcting\" or \"overwriting\" the input grids to follow a repeating pattern that is present in the input grids before they are altered.\n\n### Pattern Identification\n\nLooking at the examples:\n- The first row of each grid is uniform.\n- The pattern in the grids repeats every few rows and columns.\n\nFor instance, in **Example 1**, the original grid pattern before alteration is:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 8 8 2 8 8 2 8 8 2 8\n2 9 8 2 9 8 2 9 8 2 9\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n...\n```\nAnd it repeats. The output grid follows this original pattern.\n\n### Rule Application\n\nThe rule seems to be that the output grid follows the original repeating pattern of the input grid, ignoring any alterations.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given test input grid.\n\n### Test Input Grid\n\nInput:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 4 4 4 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 4 4 4 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\n### Output Grid Prediction\n\nTo predict the output grid, we need to identify the original pattern. The first few rows suggest a repeating pattern:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n...\n```\nThis pattern repeats every 3 rows after the first row.\n\nLet's correct the input grid according to this pattern.\n\nOutput:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given examples and identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Examples\n\nLet's examine the provided examples to identify any patterns or rules.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a specific pattern where the middle section is altered. The output grid retains the pattern outside the altered section but changes the values within it to match the surrounding pattern.\n   \n2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the input grid has a pattern, and the output grid seems to \"correct\" or change the altered section to fit the original pattern.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Again, the output grid takes the input grid and changes the altered section to match the expected pattern.\n\n4. **Example 4**: The same observation holds; the altered section in the input grid is changed in the output grid to fit the pattern.\n\n5. **Example 5**: The output grid changes the input grid's altered section to match the original pattern.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Rule\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the rule involves changing the values within a certain section of the grid to match a specific pattern or the surrounding values. However, the exact rule isn't immediately clear from just the description.\n\nLet's analyze the grids more closely:\n\n- In all examples, the output grid seems to be a \"restoration\" or a correction of the input grid to a certain pattern.\n- The altered or different section in the input grid is always \"corrected\" in the output grid.\n\nUpon a detailed examination:\n\n- **Example 1**: The middle 3x3 section is changed to match the pattern outside it.\n- **Example 2**: A similar correction happens.\n- **Example 3**: The altered values are corrected.\n- **Example 4**: The section with different values is corrected.\n- **Example 5**: The inner values are changed to match a pattern.\n\nThe common rule seems to be that any deviation from a repeating pattern in the input grid is corrected in the output grid.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nLet's analyze the test input grid:\n\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 4 4 4 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 4 4 4 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\nThe pattern in the grid is a repeating sequence where the second and third rows repeat in a cycle. The deviation occurs in the last two rows where the values `4` and the sequence disruption appear.\n\nTo correct this grid according to the observed rule, we need to identify the expected pattern and correct the deviations.\n\nThe expected pattern seems to be:\n\n- First row and every third row thereafter: `7 7 7 ...`\n- Second row and every third row thereafter: `7 1 6 7 1 6 ...`\n- Third row and every third row thereafter: `7 6 1 7 6 1 ...`\n\nLet's correct the test input grid according to this pattern.\n\n### Step 4: Correcting the Test Input Grid\n\nThe correction involves changing the deviated values to fit the pattern.\n\n- The 9th row should follow the pattern of the 3rd row (since it's the 3rd row in the cycle), so it should be `7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7`.\n\nApplying the correction:\n\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 1 6 7 1 6 7 1 6 7\n7 6 1 7 6 1 7 6 1 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given examples to identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n- A 12x14 grid with all elements being 9 except for two elements: one at (5,2) and one at (8,3), both being 3.\n\nOutput Grid:\n- The output grid is the same as the input grid except that the 3s are expanded into a 4x2 rectangle.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n- An 12x12 grid with all elements being 9 except for two elements: one at (5,7) being 7 and one at (9,1) being 7.\n\nOutput Grid:\n- The output grid has the 7s forming a 5x8 rectangle centered around the column of the original 7s (column 7), effectively expanding the 7s.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n- A 15x12 grid with all elements being 3 except for a few elements: (0,10) being 6, (4,5) being 6, (10,5) being 7, and (11,9) being 7.\n\nOutput Grid:\n- The 6 at (4,5) expands into a 5x6 rectangle around its column, and the 7s at (10,5) and (11,9) expand into a rectangle around their column.\n\n### Identifying the Rule\n\nFrom the examples, we can observe that:\n1. The non-default values (not 9, 3, etc.) in the input grid are expanded into rectangles in the output grid.\n2. The expansion is centered around the column of the non-default value.\n3. The height and width of the rectangle seem to be determined by the presence of other non-default values and their positions.\n\nLet's examine the expansion pattern closely:\n- In Example 1, the 3s expand into a 4x2 rectangle.\n- In Example 2, the 7s expand into a 5x8 rectangle.\n- In Example 3, the non-default values expand into rectangles around their respective columns.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it seems that the rule involves expanding the non-default value into a rectangle that spans a certain number of rows centered around the row/column of the non-default value.\n\n### Detailed Rule\n\nThe rule appears to be that for any non-default value (let's call it X) at position (row, col) in the input grid:\n1. Find all occurrences of X in the grid.\n2. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices where X is found.\n3. Create a rectangle in the output grid that encompasses the columns between the minimum and maximum column indices where X was found and spans a certain range of rows.\n\nLet's refine this based on the examples:\n- The column span is determined by the range of columns where X is found (min_col to max_col).\n- The row span seems to be centered around the column where X is found and extends a certain number of rows up and down.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n1. Identify non-default values (3).\n2. The 3s are at (4,1) and (6,5).\n3. Min_col = 1, max_col = 5.\n4. The output should have 3s expanded into a rectangle spanning from column 1 to 5.\n\nLet's apply a similar logic as observed:\n- The 3s are in columns 1 and 5.\n- The expansion should thus cover columns 1 through 5.\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

The output grid shows that the positions of these `3`s are used to create a rectangle where the top-left and top-right corners are the `3`s, and the area between and including these points is filled with `3`s.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 7 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 7 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n```\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 9 9 9 9\n9 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 9 9 9 9\n9 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 9 9 9 9\n9 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 9 9 9 9\n9 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n```\n\nHere, the two `7`s in the input grid are used to define the rectangle in the output grid. The top-left `7` (at row 5, column 7) and the bottom-left `7` (at row 9, column 1) define the rectangle that is filled with `7`s in the output grid.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 6 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 6 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 7 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 7 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n3 3 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3\n3 3 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3\n3 3 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3\n3 3 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3\n3 3 3 3 3 6 6 6 6 6 6 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 7 7 7 7 7 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 7 7 7 7 7 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nThe non-`3` values (`6` and `7`) define the rectangles filled with `6` and `7` respectively.\n\n### Rule Identification\n\nFrom the examples, the rule appears to be that the positions of the non-background values (different from the majority background value) in the input grid are used to define rectangles in the output grid. Specifically, the top-most and bottom-most occurrences of these non-background values are used to define the vertical span of the rectangle, and the left-most and right-most occurrences define the horizontal span. The area within this rectangle is then filled with the non-background value.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe non-background value is `3`, occurring at (4,1) and (6,5).\n\n- Top-most occurrence: (4,1)\n- Bottom-most occurrence: (6,5)\n- Left-most occurrence: (4,1)\n- Right-most occurrence: (6,5)\n\nThus, the rectangle's top-left corner is (4,1), and the bottom-right corner is (6,5).

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\nIn the input grid, there are two occurrences of the number 3, at positions (5,2) and (8,3). In the output grid, the number 3 is spread out in a 2x2 square around these positions.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\nHere, the number 7 appears at positions (5,7) and (9,1). In the output grid, the number 7 is spread out in a rectangular area starting from the first occurrence (5,7) and covering a width that encompasses the second occurrence (9,1), effectively making a rectangle that includes both points.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\nThe numbers 6 and 7 are of interest. The number 6 appears at (0,10) and (4,5), and in the output, it is spread out around these points. Similarly, 7 appears at (10,6) and (11,9), and it is spread out in the output grid. Observing closely, the spread is not just a simple square or rectangle but seems to be related to the positions of these numbers.\n\nUpon closer inspection of all examples, we can see that:\n- In Example 1, the number 3 at (5,2) and (8,3) results in a 2x2 square of 3s around these positions in the output, effectively from (5,2) to (6,3) and from (8,3) to (9,4).\n- In Example 2, the number 7 at (5,7) and (9,1) results in a rectangle of 7s from (5,1) to (9,7) in the output.\n- In Example 3, the special numbers are spread out. For instance, 6 at (0,10) and (4,5) results in 6s being spread from (4,5) to (0,10) horizontally, and 7 at (10,6) and (11,9) results in 7s being spread from (10,6) to (11,9).\n\nThe rule appears to be that the special number (different from the background) is spread out to fill a rectangle that encompasses the first and last occurrence of this number in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nThe test input grid has the number 3 at positions (4,1) and (6,5). \n\nTo apply the rule:\n- The minimum row is 4, and the maximum row is 6.\n- The minimum column is 1, and the maximum column is 5.\n\nThus, the rectangle that encompasses these positions is from (4,1) to (6,5).\n\nThe output grid should have 3s in this rectangle.\n\nLet's create the output grid:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given examples to identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n- A 12x14 grid with all elements being 9 except for two elements: one at (5,2) and one at (8,3), both being 3.\n\nOutput Grid:\n- The output grid is the same as the input grid except that the 3s are expanded into a 4x2 rectangle.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n- An 12x12 grid with all elements being 9 except for two elements: one at (5,7) being 7 and one at (9,1) being 7.\n\nOutput Grid:\n- The output grid has the 7s forming a 5x8 rectangle centered around the column of the original 7s (column 7), effectively expanding the 7s.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\n\nInput Grid:\n- A 15x12 grid with all elements being 3 except for a few elements: (0,10) being 6, (4,5) being 6, (10,5) being 7, and (11,9) being 7.\n\nOutput Grid:\n- The 6 at (4,5) expands into a 5x6 rectangle around its column, and the 7s at (10,5) and (11,9) expand into a rectangle around their column.\n\n### Identifying the Rule\n\nFrom the examples, we can observe that:\n1. The non-default values (not 9, 3, etc.) in the input grid are expanded into rectangles in the output grid.\n2. The expansion is centered around the column of the non-default value.\n3. The height and width of the rectangle seem to be determined by the presence of other non-default values and their positions.\n\nLet's examine the expansion pattern closely:\n- In Example 1, the 3s expand into a 4x2 rectangle.\n- In Example 2, the 7s expand into a 5x8 rectangle.\n- In Example 3, the non-default values expand into rectangles around their respective columns.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it seems that the rule involves expanding the non-default value into a rectangle that spans a certain number of rows centered around the row/column of the non-default value.\n\n### Detailed Rule\n\nThe rule appears to be that for any non-default value (let's call it X) at position (row, col) in the input grid:\n1. Find all occurrences of X in the grid.\n2. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices where X is found.\n3. Create a rectangle in the output grid that encompasses the columns between the minimum and maximum column indices where X was found and spans a certain range of rows.\n\nLet's refine this based on the examples:\n- The column span is determined by the range of columns where X is found (min_col to max_col).\n- The row span seems to be centered around the column where X is found and extends a certain number of rows up and down.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n1. Identify non-default values (3).\n2. The 3s are at (4,1) and (6,5).\n3. Min_col = 1, max_col = 5.\n4. The output should have 3s expanded into a rectangle spanning from column 1 to 5.\n\nLet's apply a similar logic as observed:\n- The 3s are in columns 1 and 5.\n- The expansion should thus cover columns 1 through 5.\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

Fourth row, first column: 0 to 3.\n\n### Common Rule Identification\n\nFrom the examples, we can observe that the rule involves changing certain values to 3 in the output grid based on the input grid's configuration.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The change happens at (5,2) from 1 to 3.\n2. **Example 2**: The change happens at (9,7) from 9 to 3.\n3. **Example 3**: Changes happen at (2,2) from 0 to 3 and (3,0) from 0 to 3.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the rule might be related to the diagonal or neighboring elements. However, a clear pattern isn't immediately obvious from just the changes.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the grids more closely:\n\n- In Example 1, the change is at the 6th row, 3rd column.\n- In Example 2, the change is at the 10th row, 8th column.\n- In Example 3, the changes are at the 3rd row, 2nd column, and the 4th row, 1st column.\n\nUpon a detailed examination, we can notice that the positions where the changes occur seem to be related to the presence of distinct or specific numbers in the input grid and their positions relative to other numbers.\n\nHowever, a simpler observation is that the change occurs at a position that is related to the \"edge\" or \"boundary\" of a distinct region or pattern in the grid.\n\nLet's directly analyze the pattern of changes:\n- The change seems to occur at a cell that is related to a specific pattern or a \"transition\" in the grid.\n\nGiven the input grid for prediction:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply a potential rule based on observed changes:\n1. **Identify distinct regions or patterns**: There's a row of 4s and a 9 in the second last and last rows.\n\nUpon analyzing the given examples again with a focus on relative positions and patterns, we can notice that the rule isn't straightforwardly related to a simple shift or arithmetic operation on the grid values.\n\nHowever, if we consider the last example and the test input, we can hypothesize that the rule involves changing a value based on its position relative to a distinct pattern or edge.\n\nFor the test input grid, let's directly predict based on observed patterns:\n- The distinct pattern here involves the row of 4s and the presence of 9s.\n\nLet's directly inspect potential changes:\n- The row of 4s ends at the 5th row. The next row has a 9 at the 10th column.\n\nIf we follow a similar \"change pattern\" as observed:\n- A potential change could be expected at a position related to the \"edge\" or a notable position like the first or last occurrence of a distinct number or pattern.\n\nFor the given test grid, applying a similar logic as in the examples:\n- We see that the 9s are at (5,9) and (6,10).\n- A change could potentially occur at a neighboring or related position.\n\nLet's directly apply the rule as inferred from the examples.\n\nThe output grid should be:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

Third row, second column: 0 to 3.\n2. Fourth row, first column: 0 to 3.\n\n### Common Rule Identification\n\nFrom the examples, we can observe that the rule involves changing certain values to 3 in the output grid based on the input grid's configuration.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The change happens at (5,2) from 1 to 3.\n2. **Example 2**: The change happens at (9,7) from 9 to 3.\n3. **Example 3**: Changes happen at (2,2) from 0 to 3 and (3,0) from 0 to 3.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the rule might be related to the diagonal or neighboring elements. However, a clear pattern isn't immediately obvious from just the changes.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the grids more closely:\n\n- In Example 1, the change is at the 6th row, 3rd column.\n- In Example 2, the change is at the 10th row, 8th column.\n- In Example 3, the changes are at the 3rd row, 2nd column, and the 4th row, 1st column.\n\nUpon a detailed examination, we can notice that the positions where the changes occur seem to be related to the presence of distinct or specific numbers in the input grid and their positions relative to other numbers.\n\nHowever, a simpler observation is that the change occurs at a position that is related to the \"edge\" or \"boundary\" of a distinct region or pattern in the grid.\n\nLet's directly analyze the pattern of changes:\n- The change seems to occur at a cell that is related to a specific pattern or a \"transition\" in the grid.\n\nGiven the input grid for prediction:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply a potential rule based on observed changes:\n1. **Identify distinct regions or patterns**: There's a row of 4s and a 9 in the second last and last rows.\n\nUpon analyzing the given examples again with a focus on relative positions and patterns, we can notice that the rule isn't straightforwardly related to a simple shift or arithmetic operation on the grid values.\n\nHowever, if we consider the last example and the test input, we can hypothesize that the rule involves changing a value based on its position relative to a distinct pattern or edge.\n\nFor the test input grid, let's directly predict based on observed patterns:\n- The distinct pattern here involves the row of 4s and the presence of 9s.\n\nLet's directly inspect potential changes:\n- The row of 4s ends at the 5th row. The next row has a 9 at the 10th column.\n\nIf we follow a similar \"change pattern\" as observed:\n- A potential change could be expected at a position related to the \"edge\" or a notable position like the first or last occurrence of a distinct number or pattern.\n\nFor the given test grid, applying a similar logic as in the examples:\n- We see that the 9s are at (5,9) and (6,10).\n- A change could potentially occur at a neighboring or related position.\n\nLet's directly apply the rule as inferred from the examples.\n\nThe output grid should be:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

Let's analyze the positions and values:\n\n1. **Example 1**: The change is at (5, 2) from 1 to 3. The cell above it is 5 (different from 1).\n2. **Example 2**: The change is at (9, 7) from 9 to 3. The cell above it is 9 (same as 9), but looking closely, the pattern involves the column with a distinct value (5 in this case).\n3. **Example 3**: Changes are at (2, 2) from 0 to 3 (cell above it is 6, different from 0) and (3, 1) from 0 to 3 (cell above it is 0, same as 0, but the cell to its right is 0, and the one above that is 6, indicating a potential diagonal or neighborhood influence).\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, a simpler rule seems to apply: the change occurs for a cell that is just below a cell with a different value or is at a specific position relative to a pattern.\n\nLet's directly examine the changes and their positions relative to the grid and distinct values.\n\n### Common Rule\n\nUpon detailed analysis, we can see that the rule isn't directly related to the simple neighborhood or a straightforward arithmetic operation on the cell values. However, a pattern can be deduced:\n\n- The output grid is the same as the input grid except for specific cells that change to 3.\n\nLet's directly apply the observed changes to understand the rule:\n- In Example 1, the cell at (5,2) changes to 3. It's below a 7.\n- In Example 2, the cell at (9,7) changes to 3. It's below a 9, and there's a column of 5s.\n- In Example 3, the cells at (2,2) and (3,1) change. The first is below a 6, and the second is below a 0.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTo predict the output, let's analyze the grid:\n- There's a row of 4s at the fifth row.\n- The ninth column has mostly 0s, but the tenth column has a 9 in the sixth row, and the eleventh column has a 9 in the seventh row.\n\nThe change seems to occur for a cell that is just below a distinct or non-zero value or at a specific pattern. Specifically, the cell below a non-zero or distinct value in its column or neighborhood changes.\n\nLet's directly inspect potential changes:\n- The cell below the 4s (at row 6) doesn't change because it's 0 and doesn't directly follow a distinct non-zero pattern that changes it.\n- The cell at (7, 10) is below a 9 (at (6,10)) and is 0. It could potentially change.\n\nThus, applying a similar logic:\n- The cell at (6, 10) is 9, so the cell below it, (7, 10), which is 0, changes to 3.\n\nOutput Grid:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

However, the exact pattern isn't immediately clear from the given examples.\n\n### Applying to Test Input\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's hypothesize that the rule involves changing a cell to 3 based on its position relative to other values or grid structure.\n\nGiven the lack of a clear rule from the examples and directly applying observed changes:\n- We notice that in Example 1 and Example 3, the changes occur below a certain distinct pattern or value.\n\nLet's directly examine the test input for potential changes based on observed patterns:\n- The row with all 4s is at the 5th row. \n- The changes in previous examples seem to be related to the presence of distinct numbers and their positions.\n\n### Prediction\n\nTo predict the output for the test input, let's directly apply a potential rule based on the observed examples.\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we follow a pattern similar to the one observed in the examples (though not clearly defined), we might expect changes below or near distinct values.\n\nLet's directly provide the output based on a potential interpretation of the rule.\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Input and Output Grids\n\nUpon examining the provided examples, it is evident that the output grids have a similar structure to the input grids but with some modifications in the central or specific areas.\n\n### Step 2: Compare Input and Output Grids\n\nLet's directly compare the input and output grids for each example to identify any patterns or rules.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The output grid seems to be the input grid with the central area modified. Specifically, the values in the central part of the grid are changed.\n   \n2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the central area is modified. The original values in the central cross pattern are replaced by a sequence (0, 8, 3, 8, 3) in the output.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The central area is again modified, with the original values being replaced.\n\n4. **Example 4**: The pattern continues; the central part of the grid is altered.\n\n5. **Example 5**: The same pattern is observed.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Rule\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that the rule involves modifying the central area of the grid. Specifically, for grids with an odd size (like 7x7, 9x9), the central cross (both horizontal and vertical lines through the center) and sometimes additional central elements are modified.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern of modification:\n- In **Example 1**, the central element and its immediate neighbors in the cross pattern are replaced by a sequence derived from the original central values (6, 3, 1, 3).\n- In **Example 2**, a similar pattern is observed with (0, 8, 3).\n- This pattern continues across examples, suggesting that the central area is replaced by a specific sequence or pattern derived from the original values.\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Analysis\n\nUpon a detailed analysis, it appears that the rule involves taking the central column and row and replacing their values with a new sequence. The new sequence seems to be derived from the original values in the cross pattern.\n\nFor instance, in **Example 1**, the central row is \"2 6 6 6 2 6 6\" and the central column is \"2 6 2 6 2 6 2\".

Specifically, the examples suggest that the rule involves changing the values in a cross pattern (horizontally and vertically) centered around a specific point or number.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the rule involves taking a subset of the input grid's values and rearranging or replacing them according to a certain pattern, often related to the central or distinctive numbers/areas in the grid.\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Analysis of the Pattern\n\nLooking closely at the examples:\n\n- In **Example 1**, the numbers 3 and 1 from the 8th row seem to influence the output, with a pattern that involves mirroring or replacing numbers around the central area.\n- In **Example 2** and **Example 3**, the numbers 8 and 0 (or 2) are key, with the output showing a pattern that involves these numbers.\n- In **Example 4** and **Example 5**, similar patterns are observed with different numbers.\n\nThe common rule seems to involve modifying the grid based on the central or distinctive elements, often involving a cross or diamond pattern.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n8 8 1 2 7 8 1\n1 1 1 7 1 1 1\n1 8 8 8 1 8 8\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nLet's analyze it:\n- The grid has distinctive numbers like 8, 2, and 7.\n- The pattern seems to involve the central area and the numbers around it.\n\nApplying the observed rule, which seems to involve changing the numbers around the central distinctive numbers (like 2, 7, 8) into a specific pattern, we can predict the output.\n\nThe output grid for the given test input, following the pattern observed in the examples (especially considering the cross or specific number replacement pattern), would be:\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n8 8 1 7 1 8 1\n1 1 1 7 1 1 1\n1 7 7 7 1 8 8\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nLet's directly infer or compute the output based on observed transformations.\n\n<answer>\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n8 8 1 7 1 8 1\n1 1 1 7 1 1 1\n1 7 7 7 1 8 8\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n8 8 1 7 1 8 1\n1 1 1 7 1 1 1\n1 7 7 7 1 8 8\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n</answer>",

In Example 1, the input grid is 8x8, and the output grid is 4x4. In Example 2, the input grid is also 8x8, and the output grid is again 4x4. In Example 3, the input grid is 8x6, and the output grid is 4x2. This suggests that if the input grid is NxM, the output grid could be (N/2)x(M/2), considering the grid sizes are even.\n\n2. **Elements in Output Grid**: Let's examine how elements in the output grid are generated from the input grid.\n\n- For Example 1, the output grid elements seem to be taken from specific positions in the input grid. Let's check the positions:\n  - Output[0,0] = Input[0,0] = 8 (but it's 7 in output), it seems not directly copied.\n  - Upon closer inspection, it appears that the output grid is formed by taking elements from the input grid but not directly copying them.\n\nLet's directly analyze the pattern for the output:\n\n- **First Column of Output**: In Example 1, the first column of the output grid is [7, 7, 7, 5]. Looking at the input grid, if we consider the top-left to bottom-left diagonal or nearby elements, we can observe:\n  - Output[0,0] = 7 (could be related to the first element or nearby elements in the input grid).\n  - Similarly, analyzing other examples and positions.\n\nUpon a detailed examination, we can observe that the output grid seems to be extracting or processing elements from the corners or specific patterns within sub-grids of the input grid.\n\nLet's directly check the pattern for corner or specific sub-grid values:\n\n1. The output grid's size is half of the input grid's dimensions.\n2. The elements of the output grid seem to be directly related to the corresponding sub-grids (2x2) in the input grid.\n\nLet's hypothesize that the output grid is generated by taking one specific element from each 2x2 sub-grid of the input grid. \n\nFor Example 1:\n- The top-left 2x2 sub-grid is `8 6; 6 6`, and Output[0,0] is `7`, which is not directly the top-left element.\n- Let's check the pattern for the first element of the output grid in all examples.\n\nAfter analyzing the given examples closely:\n- It appears that the output grid is formed by taking the top-right element of each 2x2 sub-grid in the input grid.\n\nLet's verify this rule:\n- For Example 1 Input Grid:\n  - Top-left 2x2 sub-grid: `8 6; 6 6`, top-right element is `6`, but Output[0,0] is `7`.\n  - Let's directly check the hypothesis for all given examples.\n\nUpon re-evaluation, let's directly inspect the given examples again and apply a simpler pattern:\n- The output seems to be related to the values within the 2x2 sub-grids.\n\nLet's directly analyze the test input grid given:\n```\n2 0 7 7 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 3 3 0 7\n7 0 7 7 0 7\n7 0 3 3 0 7\n7 0 7 7 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 7 7 0 8\n```\n\nTo predict the output grid, let's apply the observed pattern or rule.\n\nFirst, let's determine the size of the output grid. The input grid is 8x6, so the output grid should be (8/2)x(6/2) = 4x3.\n\nLet's directly form the output grid based on a simpler or more straightforward pattern observed from the given examples.\n\nIf we consider the pattern where the output grid elements are derived from the input grid by some rule related to sub-grids or specific element extraction, we should directly check the values.\n\nLet's analyze the first 2x2 sub-grid:\n```\n2 0\n0 0\n```\nAnd subsequent sub-grids.\n\nAfter directly checking the given examples and trying to apply a pattern:\n- It seems the rule could be related to extracting a specific element or a simple operation on the 2x2 sub-grids.\n\nLet's directly apply a potential rule to the test input grid.\n\nGiven the input grid:\n```\n2 0 7 7 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 3 3 0 7\n7 0 7 7 0 7\n7 0 3 3 0 7\n7 0 7 7 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 7 7 0 8\n```\n\nLet's divide it into 2x2 sub-grids and observe:\n1. Top-left sub-grid: `2 0; 0 0`\n2. Next sub-grid to the right: `7 7; 0 0`\n3. Next sub-grid to the right: `0 1; 0 0`\n\nAnd so on.\n\nLet's directly form the output grid.\n\nThe output grid should be 4x3. Let's directly extract or compute the elements.\n\nLet's hypothesize that the output is directly related to a simple transformation or extraction.\n\nAfter re-checking the examples, let's directly predict the output for the test input grid.\n\nTo directly provide the output grid for the given test input:\nLet's analyze the pattern again with a simpler perspective.\n\nThe output grid for the input:\n```\n2 0 7 7 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 3 3 0 7\n7 0 7 7 0 7\n7 0 3 3 0 7\n7 0 7 7 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 7 7 0 8\n```\n\nLet's directly check the corners or specific values.\n\nThe output grid is:\n```\n7 0 1\n7 7 7\n9 7 7\n7 7 8\n```\n\n<answer>\n7 0 1\n7 7 7\n9 7 7\n7 7 8\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>7 0 1\n7 7 7\n9 7 7\n7 7 8</answer>",

Let's examine the pattern closely:\n\n1. **Identifying the Pattern**: Upon closer inspection, it appears that the rule involves modifying the middle rows and columns of the grid. Specifically, the values in the grid change in a certain pattern around the central area.\n\n2. **Analyzing Changes**: \n   - In Example 1, the top 3x4 sub-grid changes, with the second row and column being affected differently.\n   - In Example 2, the middle row and column (4th row and column in a 5x5 grid) are modified.\n   - In Example 3, the 4th and 5th rows are affected, with the 5th row being the middle row of the grid.\n   - In Example 4, similar to Example 2, the middle row and column are modified.\n   - In Example 5, the top 3x5 sub-grid is affected.\n\n3. **Common Rule**: Upon further analysis, it seems the rule involves changing the grid values around the middle row and/or column. Specifically, for grids with an odd number of rows or columns, the exact middle row/column is a pivot. For grids with an even number of rows or columns, the rule seems to apply to the two middle rows/columns or just one of them depending on the example.\n\nLet's directly analyze the pattern:\n- The rule seems to be related to the central part of the grid.\n- For each example, the output grid differs from the input grid in the middle section.\n\nUpon a detailed review:\n- The pattern involves changing the grid elements in the middle rows and/or columns to a certain value (often 4 in the examples).\n\nLet's directly infer the rule from the given examples:\n- The rule appears to be that the elements in the grid that are in the same row or column as the central element(s) are modified to a certain value if they are not on the edge or if they are in a specific pattern.\n\nTo deduce the exact rule, let's simplify:\n- Looking at all examples, it seems that the rule applies to a \"cross\" shape around the middle of the grid. The \"cross\" involves the middle row and column.\n\nLet's check if the rule could be that the middle row and column (or the rows/columns around the center for even-sized grids) are changed to a specific value or pattern.\n\n### Rule Formulation\nAfter analyzing the given examples:\n- The output grid is the same as the input grid except for the elements in the middle row and/or column, which are changed.\n\nLet's directly check the examples again with this hypothesis:\n1. **Example 1**: The grid is 6x4. The middle rows are 3rd and 4th. The top part changes, with a \"4\" appearing in the top 3x4 sub-grid.\n2. **Example 2**: The grid is 5x5 (odd). The middle row and column (3rd) are affected, with values changing to \"4\".\n3. **Example 3**: The grid is 9x3. The middle row (5th) is affected, changing to \"4\".\n4. **Example 4**: The grid is 5x5. The middle row and column are affected, with changes to \"4\".\n5. **Example 5**: The grid is 6x5.

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given examples and identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\nIn Example 1, the input grid is a 6x4 grid with a specific pattern, and the output grid has changes in the top part. Observing the grid, the values at positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3) are changed to 4 in the output grid.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Example 2\nIn Example 2, the 5x5 input grid has a different pattern. The output grid shows that the middle row and column (except the central element which remains 9) are changed to 4. This indicates a possible rule related to the middle row and column.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Example 3\nExample 3 provides an 8x3 grid. Here, the fourth and sixth rows are mostly unchanged, but the fifth row is altered to have 4s except where there's a 5. The change occurs in the middle row.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Example 4\nIn Example 4, a 5x5 grid is given. The third and fifth rows are changed to have 4s in the third, fourth, and fifth columns, indicating a pattern related to the middle row.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing Example 5\nExample 5 shows a 6x5 grid. The first and second rows are changed to have 4s in the second, third, and fourth columns, indicating a rule that might be related to the proximity to the top.\n\n## Step 6: Identifying the Common Rule\nUpon closer inspection of all examples, it appears that the rule involves changing the values in a specific pattern around the middle of the grid. Specifically, for grids with an odd number of rows, the middle row is affected. For grids with an even number of rows, the row just above or below the exact middle is affected. The change involves setting certain elements to 4, particularly those not on the edges of the pattern in the row(s) around the middle.\n\n## Step 7: Detailed Observation\nObserving the examples closely:\n- In Example 1 (6x4), the top 3 rows are affected, with the second row being fully changed except for the last column, and the first and third rows having their second and third columns changed.\n- In Example 2 (5x5), the middle row and column are changed to 4 except for the central element.\n- In Example 3 (8x3), the fifth row is changed.\n- In Example 4 (5x5), the third and fifth rows are changed to 4 in the last three columns.\n- In Example 5 (6x5), the first and second rows are changed.\n\n## Step 8: Refining the Rule\nThe rule seems to be related to changing the grid elements around the middle row. For an odd number of rows, the middle row is directly affected. For an even number of rows, the rows around the middle are affected.\n\n## Step 9: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nThe test input grid is an 8x8 grid. Since 8 is even, we look at the rows around the middle, which are the 4th and 5th rows (since the middle would be between the 4th and 5th rows).\n\n## Step 10: Predicting the Output Grid\nFor the given 8x8 input grid:\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n1 1 1 9 1 1 1 1\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n\nThe 4th and 5th rows are around the middle. The rule seems to change these rows to have 4s in certain positions.\n\n## Step 11: Finalizing the Output Grid\nApplying the observed pattern:\n- The 4th row (7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7) should change to have 4s around the 9, resulting in 7 7 4 4 4 7 7 7.\n- The 5th row (7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7) should similarly change to 7 7 4 4 4 7 7 7.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n1 1 1 9 1 1 1 1\n7 7 4 4 4 7 7 7\n7 7 4 4 4 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n1 1 1 9 1 1 1 1\n7 7 4 4 4 7 7 7\n7 7 4 4 4 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given examples to identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\nIn the first example, the input grid is:\n```\n2 1 2 2\n3 1 3 3\n2 1 2 2\n2 1 2 2\n2 1 2 2\n2 1 2 2\n```\nAnd the output grid is:\n```\n4 4 4 2\n4 1 4 3\n4 4 4 2\n2 1 2 2\n2 1 2 2\n2 1 2 2\n```\nObserving the output, the top-left 3x3 sub-grid has been modified. Specifically, the values in the first three rows have changed.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Example 2\nThe input grid is:\n```\n3 3 7 3 3\n3 3 7 3 3\n3 3 7 3 3\n9 9 9 9 9\n3 3 7 3 3\n```\nAnd the output grid is:\n```\n3 3 7 3 3\n3 3 7 3 3\n3 4 4 4 3\n9 4 9 4 9\n3 4 4 4 3\n```\nHere, the 3x3 sub-grid centered around the fourth row (which is actually the row with '9's and the rows around it) is affected, but more precisely, it seems the rule applies to a specific area.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Example 3\nInput:\n```\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n5 5 5\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n```\nOutput:\n```\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n4 4 4\n4 5 4\n4 4 4\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n```\nThe change occurs around the middle row where '5 5 5' is. The row '5 5 5' and its neighboring rows are affected.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Example 4\nInput:\n```\n1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 2 1\n3 3 3 3 3\n1 1 1 2 1\n```\nOutput:\n```\n1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 4 4 4\n3 3 4 3 4\n1 1 4 4 4\n```\nThe change is around the row '3 3 3 3 3', affecting it and its neighboring rows.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing Example 5\nInput:\n```\n8 8 5 8 8\n3 3 5 3 3\n8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 5 8 8\n```\nOutput:\n```\n8 4 4 4 8\n3 4 5 4 3\n8 4 4 4 8\n8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 5 8 8\n```\nThe change occurs in the top 3x5 sub-grid.\n\n### Step 6: Identifying the Pattern\nUpon closer inspection of all examples, it appears that the rule involves changing the values in a specific pattern around a certain row or column that stands out due to its value being different from its neighbors or due to its position.\n\nNoticing the pattern:\n- In each example, the grid values change in a 3x3 sub-grid centered around a distinctive row or the area where there's a change in the pattern.\n- The change involves setting certain cells to '4', which seems to be a special value indicating a change.\n\n### Step 7: Detailed Observation\nUpon a detailed observation:\n- The change happens around a row that is different from its immediate neighbors.\n- The 'different' row and its immediate neighbors are affected.\n- The pattern of change involves replacing certain values with '4', specifically in a 3xN or Nx3 sub-grid around the distinctive row.\n\n### Step 8: Applying the Rule\nThe rule seems to be: when there's a row that is distinct from its neighbors, the 3x3 sub-grid centered on this row changes. The elements in this sub-grid that are not on the central row or column are changed to '4', except for the elements that are already distinct or part of the original distinct row.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given test input grid:\n```\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n1 1 1 9 1 1 1 1\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n```\nThe row `1 1 1 9 1 1 1 1` is distinct from its neighbors. Thus, we apply the rule around this row.\n\n### Step 9: Predicting the Output Grid\nThe 3x3 sub-grid centered around `1 1 1 9 1 1 1 1` will change. The sub-grid to consider is:\n```\n7 7 7\n1 1 1\n7 7 7\n```\nThe output for this sub-grid should be:\n```\n7 4 7\n1 4 1\n7 4 7\n```\nAnd the rest of the grid remains the same.\n\nThus, the predicted output grid is:\n```\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 4 7 9 7 7 7 7\n1 4 1 9 1 1 1 1\n7 4 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n```\nLet's format it correctly:\n```\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 4 7 9 7 7 7 7\n1 4 1 9 1 1 1 1\n7 4 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n```\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 4 7 9 7 7 7 7\n1 4 1 9 1 1 1 1\n7 4 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 9 7 7 7 7\n</answer>",

However, a simpler pattern could be that the change happens at a specific positional rule related to the distinct element or the grid's structure.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the changes more precisely:\n- The changed element is not necessarily directly related to the distinct value but seems to be related to its position or the grid's structure.\n\nUpon a detailed review:\n- Example 1: The \"5\" is in the third row, second column. The change happens in the second row, fifth column.\n- Example 2: The \"4\" and \"5\" are distinct. The change happens in the last row, first column.\n- Example 3: The \"3\" and \"5\" are distinct from \"9\". The change happens in the first row, second column.\n- Example 4: The \"3\" and \"1\" are distinct from \"2\". The change happens in the first row, second column.\n\nIt seems the rule isn't directly related to the value but rather to the position. Let's directly inspect the pattern of change:\n- The change occurs at a position that seems related to the layout and distinct values.\n\nHowever, a clear, simple rule can be derived when noticing the position of the change relative to the grid and distinct elements.\n\n### Direct Observation\nLet's directly analyze the given grids again and look for a pattern in the changes.\n\nAfter re-evaluation, we can notice that the rule is to increment or change the value of an element that is in a certain positional relationship with other elements or distinct values.\n\n### Applying to the Test Input Grid\nGiven the input grid:\n```\n4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n```\nLet's directly apply the observed pattern. If we follow the pattern of changing a value based on the distinct element or grid structure, we need to identify the distinct element or the relevant position.\n\nThe distinct elements here are \"4\" and \"0\". If we look at the structure and the examples again, we can see that the change often relates to being near or related to a distinct value.\n\nFor the given test grid, let's hypothesize that the rule involves changing an element near or related to \"0\" or another distinct value.\n\nUpon closer inspection and trying to fit the observed changes in the examples:\n- The change seems to occur in a manner that is related to the position of distinct values or edges.\n\nLet's directly check the output for a pattern match:\nIf we consider the \"0\" as a distinct value and look at its neighborhood, we can observe that the change could be related to an adjacent cell.\n\nThe output grid, based on a potential rule that involves changing a cell related to the distinct \"0\", could be:\n```\n4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 4 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n```\nGiven this, let's directly provide the output.\n\n<answer>\n4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 4 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 4 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n</answer> is replaced with the correct format as per the question's request.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 4 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\nInput:\n```\n4 4 4 9 4 4 4\n4 4 4 9 4 4 4\n4 5 5 9 4 4 4\n```\nOutput:\n```\n4 4 4 9 4 4 4\n4 4 4 9 5 4 4\n4 5 5 9 5 4 4\n```\nIn the output, the element at position (1,5) is changed to 5, and the element at position (2,5) is also 5. It seems the change is related to the presence of a different number (5) in the neighborhood.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\nInput:\n```\n3 3\n3 4\n5 5\n3 3\n3 3\n```\nOutput:\n```\n3 3\n3 4\n5 5\n3 3\n4 3\n```\nHere, the bottom left element changes to 4. Observing the input, there's a 4 at (1,2), and it seems the rule could be related to the presence of this 4.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\nInput:\n```\n9 9\n9 9\n3 3\n9 9\n9 5\n```\nOutput:\n```\n9 5\n9 9\n3 3\n9 9\n9 5\n```\nThe top right element changes to 5. Noting the input, there's a 5 at (4,2), and the change occurs at (0,1), suggesting a possible relation to the column or presence of a different number.\n\n### Example 4 Analysis\nInput:\n```\n2 2 3 2 2\n2 2 3 2 1\n```\nOutput:\n```\n2 1 3 2 2\n2 2 3 2 1\n```\nThe top left element changes to 1 (the same as the bottom right). Observing the grid, the change seems related to the presence of a different number (1) at the bottom right.\n\n### General Rule Deduction\nUpon closer inspection of all examples, a pattern emerges where the change in the output grid seems to be related to the \"infection\" or \"change\" of a value from a neighboring cell or a specific pattern. Let's directly analyze the changes:\n- In Example 1, the value 5 \"infects\" or changes the value to its right.\n- In Example 2, the presence of 4 seems to \"infect\" downwards.\n- In Example 3, the 5 at the bottom seems to \"infect\" upwards.\n- In Example 4, the 1 at the bottom right \"infects\" upwards and to the left.\n\nA common theme is that a different number (not the dominant number in its immediate or broader neighborhood) seems to cause a change in a specific direction or pattern in the output grid.\n\nUpon a detailed review, it appears the rule involves changing a value in the output grid based on the presence of a distinct or different value in the input grid. Specifically, it seems that the distinct value \"propagates\" or \"infects\" in a certain manner.\n\nLet's directly examine the pattern:\n1. **Identify the distinct element**: In each grid, identify an element that is different from its immediate neighbors or stands out.\n2. **Observe the change**: Note how this distinct element affects the output.\n\nAfter re-evaluation:\n- The rule appears to be that the distinct or different number in the input grid \"propagates\" one step in a particular direction in the output grid.\n\nLet's apply this observed rule to the given test input grid.\n\n### Test Input Grid\nInput:\n```\n4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n```\nHere, the distinct numbers are 1 (surrounded by 4s or other numbers) and 0. Let's analyze:\n- The number 0 is distinct and appears in the third column.\n- The presence of 1 among 4s is also distinct.\n\nThe output grid should reflect a change due to the presence of these distinct numbers.\n\n### Applying the Rule\nThe distinct element '0' is in the 4th column. It seems from examples that '0' or any distinct number might not directly influence the neighboring cells in a straightforward manner without understanding the exact direction or rule of \"infection.\"\n\nHowever, if we follow a simpler observed pattern from the examples:\n- A distinct number seems to affect its neighboring cells or cells in a specific pattern.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given test input and predict the output based on observed patterns.\n\nGiven the input:\n```\n4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n```\nIf we consider the distinct number '0' and its influence:\n- '0' is at the 4th column. If we consider an \"infection\" or change pattern, it might affect the neighboring cells.\n\nHowever, without a clear direction from the examples, let's directly infer from the closest example (Example 1) where a similar pattern is observed.\n\n### Predicting the Output\nIf the rule involves changing a cell based on the presence of a distinct number, let's directly apply a possible interpretation:\n- The distinct '0' column might influence the column to its left or right.\n\nLet's directly apply a simple and logical rule that could fit all examples:\n- The presence of a distinct number (like 5, 4, 1, or 0 in the examples) seems to cause a change.\n\nFor the given input grid:\n```\n4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n```\nLet's hypothesize that the distinct '0' affects the cell to its left (as one possible simple rule).\n\nThus, changing the cell to the left of '0' (which is at column 3, so the cell at column 2 or position (0,3)'s left neighbor, i.e., (0,2)) could be a possible rule. However, directly applying this:\n- The '1' at (0,2) could change due to '0'.\n\nLet's directly predict:\nOutput:\n```\n4 1 0 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n```\nThis follows a pattern where '0' influences the cell to its left.\n\n<answer>\n4 1 0 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n</answer>\n\nLet's provide the final answer as per the required format.\n\n<answer>4 1 0 0 1 1 1\n1 4 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1</answer>",

The '2's in the first and fifth rows influence the output, with '6's appearing below '2' in the last row.\n   \n2. **Example 2**: The '2' in the input grid is transformed into '4' in the output. The '5's remain '5', and a '2' appears in the output grid in the first row and fifth row, related to the '5' and '2' in the input.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The '3' in the input grid is associated with a '3' or '4' in the output grid. A '3' appears in the second column of the output grid, related to the '7' and '3' or '9' in the input.\n\n### Common Rule\n\nUpon closer inspection, a pattern emerges:\n- The output grid seems to be influenced by the \"edge\" or \"boundary\" values and specific numbers within the grid.\n- Notably, a distinct value (not 6, 9, or 7) within the grid (like 6 in Example 1, 2 in Example 2, and implicitly 3 in Example 3) influences the output.\n- The transformation involves changing certain values to a new value or propagating a value (like '6' in Example 1) based on its presence and position.\n\nThe key observation is that the second column in the output grid often takes a distinct value related to a specific input value or condition. Moreover, the presence of a distinct number (e.g., 6, 2, 3) in the input grid seems to trigger a transformation that affects the output grid.\n\n### Identifying the Rule\n\nAfter analyzing the examples, the rule appears to involve:\n1. Identifying a \"distinct\" or \"special\" value within the grid (not the dominant value).\n2. Propagating or transforming this value or related values into the output grid, often in a specific pattern or direction.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the input grid:\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 0 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nThe distinct value here is '3', and another distinct value is '0'. Following the observed pattern:\n- '3' and '0' are distinct and might influence the output.\n- The second column takes a distinct value related to '3'.\n\nLet's predict the output based on observed patterns:\n1. The '3' in the input grid could influence the second column.\n2. '0' is transformed into '4' or another distinct value.\n\nThus, applying a similar transformation:\n- The '3' and '0' influence the output.\n- The output grid's second column becomes '3' (as in Example 3).\n\nOutput Grid Prediction:\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n3 4 7 7 4 7 7\n3 3 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n\n<answer>\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n3 4 7 7 4 7 7\n3 3 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>\n\n<answer>7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n3 4 7 7 4 7 7\n3 3 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7</answer>",

The value at the position (1,1) or the top-left corner does not directly influence the output in a straightforward manner across all examples.\n2. However, a pattern emerges when looking at the \"exceptional\" or different values within the grid and how they influence the output.\n\nLet's directly analyze the changes:\n- In Example 1, the '6' at (1,5) influences the row below it and to its right in the output.\n- In Example 2, the '2' at (4,2) becomes '4', and the first column becomes '2'.\n- In Example 3, the second column becomes '3', and there's a change in the last column's elements.\n\nUpon a detailed review, it seems that:\n- The second column is changed to a specific value (not necessarily the same across examples).\n- There's a transformation related to the \"different\" or \"special\" values within the grid.\n\nHowever, a clear, consistent rule across all examples isn't immediately obvious from the initial observations. Let's directly infer a potential rule based on the provided examples and then apply it to the test input.\n\n### Rule Inference\n\nAfter re-evaluating the examples:\n1. The element in the second column of every row becomes a specific value (e.g., 3 in Example 3, 2 in Example 2, and potentially related to the \"different\" value or a fixed transformation).\n2. The \"special\" or different value within the grid (like 6 in Example 1, 2 in Example 2) influences the output grid, often by changing its value or the values around it.\n\nLet's simplify the rule inference:\n- The second column is modified to a certain value. Let's check if it's related to the input grid's values or a fixed operation.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nInput:\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 0 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nLet's directly apply the observations:\n- The second column becomes a certain value. If we follow Example 3's pattern, the second column could become '3' (as it did with '9' becoming '3').\n\nOutput Grid:\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n3 4 7 7 0 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n\nLet's format the output grid as per the required format.\n\n<answer>\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n3 4 7 7 0 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 3\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n3 4 7 7 0 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 3 7 7 7 7 7\n</answer> is the solution.",

This matches the rule if we consider the input as a 1x1 grid.\n- Example 2: The input grid is 2x3, so the output should be 6x9. However, the output given is 9x9, which is filled with 9. This seems to be an exception or a different interpretation where the output size is determined by the value (9) rather than the grid size.\n- Example 3: Input is 3x3, so the output is 9x9. The pattern holds as each element of the input grid is repeated in a 3x3 sub-grid in the output.\n- Example 4: Input is 2x1, so the output should be 6x3, which matches the given output.\n\n### Step 8: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nGiven the input grid:\n2 2\n2 2\n\nThe size of the input grid is 2x2. According to the observed rule, the output grid should be 3 times the size of the input grid, so it should be 6x6.\n\nSince all elements in the input grid are the same (2), the entire output grid should be filled with 2.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n</answer>",

The values in the output grid are filled based on the input grid. For the elements that correspond to the positions within the original input grid, they are directly copied. For the other positions, they seem to be filled with the values from the input grid in a mirrored or repeated manner.\n\nLet's examine Example 4 closely as it provides a clearer pattern for the output:\n- The first row of the input (7 4 2) is mirrored to get (7 4 2 2 2 7) in the first row of the output.\n- The pattern continues with the rest of the rows, where the values are either directly copied or mirrored/filled based on the input grid values.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that:\n- The output grid's size is twice that of the input grid.\n- The first and last rows and columns of the output grid are mirrored or reflect the input grid's edges.\n\nTo predict the output for the given test input grid:\nInput:\n0 0  \n0 0  \n\nFollowing the observed rule:\n1.

It is not necessarily the number that appears least frequently overall but is notable for being different.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The output is `5`, a number that is not the dominant number (`6`) and appears less frequently.

However, upon a detailed count: `9` appears 11 times, `8` appears 19 times. So, `8` is more frequent than `9`, making `8` the most frequent and `9` the second most. The output is actually `1`, which is not the second most frequent. Let's reevaluate: The numbers and their counts are `9`: 11, `8`: 19, `1`: 2. Here, the least frequent number is `1`, which is the output.\n  \n- **Example 2**: `5` is the most frequent, and `9` and `2` are less frequent. Upon counting: `5` appears 57 times, `2` appears 7 times, and `9` appears 3 times. The least frequent among the distinct numbers is `9`, which is the output.\n\n- **Example 3**: `6` is the most frequent. Upon counting: `6` appears 31 times, `1` appears 9 times, and `5` appears 2 times.

It is not necessarily the number that appears least frequently overall but is notable for being different.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The output is `5`, a number that is not the dominant number (`6`) and appears less frequently. It is also notable among the less frequent numbers.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that the output in each case is the second most frequent number in the grid.\n\n### Checking the Hypothesis:\n- **Example 1**: `9` is the most frequent, `8` is the second most frequent, and `1` is the output. However, upon a detailed count: `9` appears 11 times, `8` appears 19 times. So, `8` is more frequent than `9`, making `8` the most frequent and `9` the second most. The output is actually `1`, which is not the second most frequent. Let's reevaluate: The numbers and their counts are `9`: 11, `8`: 19, `1`: 2. Here, the least frequent number is `1`, which is the output.\n  \n- **Example 2**: `5` is the most frequent, and `9` and `2` are less frequent. Upon counting: `5` appears 57 times, `2` appears 7 times, and `9` appears 3 times. The least frequent among the distinct numbers is `9`, which is the output.\n\n- **Example 3**: `6` is the most frequent. Upon counting: `6` appears 31 times, `1` appears 9 times, and `5` appears 2 times.

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given examples and identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Examples\n\nLet's examine the provided examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**:\n   - Input: A 7x9 grid with various numbers, predominantly '8' and '9', with '1' appearing once in the top-left 3x3 subgrid.\n   - Output: '1'\n\n2. **Example 2**:\n   - Input: An 8x8 grid, predominantly '5', with '2' and '9' appearing in specific patterns.\n   - Output: '9'\n\n3. **Example 3**:\n   - Input: A 9x6 grid (though described as 6x6, the example given is actually 9x6), predominantly '6', with '5' and '1' appearing in specific patterns.\n   - Output: '5'\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Pattern\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can observe that the output in each example is not directly related to the size of the grid or the predominant number. However, looking at the arrangement and the numbers that are different from the predominant number, we can notice a pattern:\n\n- In **Example 1**, '1' is the number that is different from '9' and '8', and it appears in the top-left 3x3 subgrid. The output is '1'.\n- In **Example 2**, '2' and '9' are different from '5'. '9' appears multiple times, and '2' appears once in a pattern. The output is '9', which is the second distinct number.\n- In **Example 3**, '5' and '1' are different from '6'. '5' appears twice, and '1' appears multiple times. The output is '5', which is the first distinct number appearing.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Rule\n\nFrom the observations, it seems that the output is related to the distinct numbers that appear in the grid. Specifically, the rule appears to be that the output is the second most frequent distinct number (or the first distinct number if we consider the order of appearance or some other characteristic).\n\nHowever, upon a more detailed examination:\n- The output corresponds to the second distinct number that appears in the grid when considering the numbers that are not the dominant number.\n\nLet's directly analyze the grids:\n- In **Example 1**, the dominant numbers are '8' and '9', and '1' is the distinct number, which is the output.\n- In **Example 2**, '5' is dominant, '2' and '9' are distinct. '9' is the output.\n- In **Example 3**, '6' is dominant, '5' and '1' are distinct. '5' is the output.\n\nIt seems the rule could be related to identifying the distinct numbers and their order or frequency.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7\n0 7 6 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 7 0 7 0 0 0\n6 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe dominant number is '0'. The distinct numbers are '6' and '7'. '6' appears first (in the order of appearance in the grid), and '7' appears subsequently.\n\nFollowing the observed pattern where the output is related to the distinct numbers, we see that '6' is the first distinct number and '7' is the second.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Output\n\nBased on the pattern observed, where the output seems to be related to the distinct numbers ('6' and '7' in this case), and considering that '7' is the second distinct number that appears, the output should be '7'.\n\n<answer>7</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the structure of the input and output grids in the examples.\nIn Example 1, the input grid is 2x2, and the output grid is 4x4. In Example 2, the input grid is 3x2, and the output grid is 6x6 (3*2 x 2*3). In Example 3, the input grid is 2x2, and the output grid is 4x4. This suggests that the output grid size is related to the input grid size.\n\n\n## Step 2: Examine how the elements from the input grid are distributed in the output grid.\nLooking at Example 1, the top-left element (9) of the input grid is repeated in a 2x2 sub-grid in the top-left of the output grid. The top-right element (9) is repeated in a 2x2 sub-grid to its right. The bottom-left element (8) is repeated below the top-left sub-grid, and the bottom-right element (0) is repeated below the top-right sub-grid.\n\n\n## Step 3: Confirm the pattern by checking the other examples.\nIn Example 2, each element of the input grid is repeated in a 3x3 sub-grid in the output grid, following the same relative position. The first column of the input grid (4, 8, 6) is repeated in three 3x3 sub-grids in the output grid, and the second column (9, 6, 4) is similarly repeated to the right. This results in a 6x6 grid.\n\n\n## Step 4: Apply the observed pattern to understand the rule.\nThe rule appears to be that each element in the input grid is repeated in an n x m sub-grid in the output grid, where n is the number of rows in the input grid, and m is the number of columns. The arrangement of these sub-grids in the output grid corresponds to the arrangement of the elements in the input grid.\n\n\n## Step 5: Test the rule with the given input grid.\nThe given input grid is:\n6 5\n6 9\n\nIt is a 2x2 grid. According to the rule, each element should be repeated in a 2x2 sub-grid. So, the output should be a 4x4 grid where:\n- The top-left element (6) is repeated in a 2x2 sub-grid in the top-left.\n- The top-right element (5) is repeated in a 2x2 sub-grid to its right.\n- The bottom-left element (6) is repeated below the top-left sub-grid.\n- The bottom-right element (9) is repeated below the top-right sub-grid.\n\n\n## Step 6: Generate the output grid based on the rule.\nApplying the rule:\n- Top-left (6) repeated: 6 6\n                     6 6\n- Top-right (5) repeated: 5 5\n                     5 5\nSo, the top half is: 6 6 5 5\n                   6 6 5 5\n- Bottom-left (6) repeated: 6 6\n                         6 6\n- Bottom-right (9) repeated: 9 9\n                         9 9\nSo, the bottom half is: 6 6 9 9\n                      6 6 9 9\n\nCombining them gives:\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 9 9\n6 6 9 9\n\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 9 9\n6 6 9 9\n</answer>\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>6 6 5 5\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 9 9\n6 6 9 9</answer>",

Each element is repeated in a 3x3 sub-grid.\n- In Example 3, the input grid has 2 rows. The output grid is 4x4. Each element is repeated in a 2x2 sub-grid.\n\nThe rule appears to be that for an input grid with 'n' rows, the output grid will be of size '2n x 2n'. Each element from the input grid is used to fill a sub-grid of size 'n x n' in the output grid, with the position of the sub-grid corresponding to the position of the element in the input grid.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given test input grid.\n\nInput:\n6 5\n6 9\n\nThis input grid has 2 rows. So, 'n' = 2. The output grid should be of size '2n x 2n' = 4x4.\n\n1. The first element is '6'. It should fill a 2x2 sub-grid at the top left.\n2. The second element is '5'. It should fill a 2x2 sub-grid to the right of '6'.\n3. The third element is '6'. It should fill a 2x2 sub-grid below '6'.\n4. The fourth element is '9'. It should fill a 2x2 sub-grid below '5' and to the right of '6'.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 9 9\n6 6 9 9\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 9 9\n6 6 9 9\n</answer>",

The elements in the output grid seem to follow a pattern related to the input grid. Specifically, the first row of the output grid is a repetition of the first row of the input grid. The second row of the output grid contains elements that are not directly copied from the input grid; instead, they seem to follow a different rule.\n\n### Step 3: Examining the Rule for Each Element in the Output Grid\nUpon closer inspection of Example 1 and other examples, we can observe:\n- The output grid's size is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\n- For each element in the output grid, its value depends on its position relative to the input grid.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Pattern Across Examples\nLet's analyze the pattern across the given examples to identify a common rule.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The input is a 2x2 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid. The first and third rows of the output are the same as the first row of the input repeated. The second and fourth rows are not directly the second row of the input but follow a pattern where the second row's elements are replaced or modified.\n\n2. **Common Observations**:\n   - The output grid is twice the size of the input grid.\n   - The value at each position in the output grid seems to depend on whether the sum of its row and column indices is even or odd.\n\n### Step 5: Detailed Analysis of the Pattern\nUpon a detailed analysis:\n- When the sum of the row and column index is even, the output grid's element is the same as the corresponding element in the input grid.\n- When the sum of the row and column index is odd, the element is replaced by '8' if the corresponding input grid element is not '8', otherwise, or in some cases, it follows a different rule.\n\nHowever, a simpler and more consistent rule across all examples is:\n- The output grid is constructed by replicating the input grid in a specific pattern.\n- For each cell in the output grid, if the sum of its row and column indices is even, it takes the value from the corresponding position in the input grid (considering the input grid's dimensions and the output grid's indexing).\n- If the sum of the row and column index is odd, it is replaced by '8'.\n\n### Step 6: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nGiven the input grid:\n4 5\n4 4\n\nTo generate the output grid, we apply the observed rule:\n1. The output grid will be a 4x4 grid because the input grid is 2x2.\n2. For each element in the output grid:\n   - At positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), the values are from the input grid, so they are 4, 5, 4, 4 respectively.\n   - At positions (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), we apply the rule for odd sums.\n\nLet's fill in the output grid according to the rule:\n- (0,0) = 4 (even sum)\n- (0,1) = 8 (odd sum)\n- (0,2) = 5 (even sum)\n- (0,3) = 8 (odd sum)\n- (1,0) = 8 (odd sum)\n- (1,1) = 4 (even sum)\n- (1,2) = 8 (odd sum)\n- (1,3) = 4 (even sum)\n- (2,0) = 4 (even sum)\n- (2,1) = 8 (odd sum)\n- (2,2) = 4 (even sum)\n- (2,3) = 8 (odd sum)\n- (3,0) = 8 (odd sum)\n- (3,1) = 4 (even sum)\n- (3,2) = 8 (odd sum)\n- (3,3) = 4 (even sum)\n\nThus, the output grid will be:\n4 8 5 8\n8 4 8 4\n4 8 4 8\n8 4 8 4\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n4 8 5 8\n8 4 8 4\n4 8 4 8\n8 4 8 4\n</answer>",

The output grid seems to be a repetition or transformation of the input grid.\n   \n2. **Example 2**: The input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 6x6. Again, the output is a larger grid derived from the input.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The input grid is 4x3, and the output grid is 8x6. The dimensions of the output grid are twice those of the input grid.\n\n4. **Example 4**: The input grid is 3x2, and the output grid is 6x4 (or more accurately, it follows the pattern where the output dimensions are twice the input dimensions, but the grid is not a perfect rectangle in the traditional sense as it has been transformed).\n\n5. **Example 5**: The input grid is 4x2, and the output grid is 8x4.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Transformation Rule\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can observe that the output grid's dimensions are twice those of the input grid. Let's examine how the elements are transformed:\n\n- The first row of the output grid is a repetition of the first row of the input grid.\n- For the elements that are not directly copied from the input grid, a specific value (8) is used.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern more closely:\n\n1. **Example 1**:\n   - Input: \n     ```\n     9 1\n     1 1\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     9 1 9 1\n     1 8 1 8\n     9 1 9 1\n     1 8 1 8\n     ```\n   The pattern here is that the original grid is repeated, and where the original grid's elements are not directly copied, they are replaced with '8'.\n\n2. Observing the output grids, it seems that:\n   - The elements from the input grid are directly copied to the output grid at even positions (0-indexed) in both dimensions.\n   - At odd positions, if the corresponding input grid element is the same as the one directly above or to the left of it (in the input grid), it's replaced with '8'.\n\nLet's directly check the rule on the given test input grid.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nInput:\n```\n4 5\n4 4\n```\n\nTo generate the output grid, we follow the observed pattern:\n\n1. The output grid will be 4x4 (twice the dimensions of the 2x2 input grid).\n\n2. Directly copying the input grid elements to the even positions (0-indexed) in both dimensions:\n   - (0,0) -> 4, (0,2) -> 5, (2,0) -> 4, (2,2) -> 4\n\n3. Filling in the rest with '8' where the input grid element is not directly available or is different from its neighbor.\n\nLet's directly apply the transformation:\n- Output Grid:\n  - Row 1 (copying input row 1): `4 5 4 5`\n  - Row 2 (since the corresponding input row is the same as the one above it, replace with '8' where necessary): `4 8 4 8`\n  - Row 3 (copying input row 2, but since it's different from row 1, we still follow the pattern): `4 4 4 4`\n  - Row 4 (similar to row 2, replacing with '8'): `4 8 4 8`\n\nSo, the output grid is:\n```\n4 5 4 5\n4 8 4 8\n4 4 4 4\n4 8 4 8\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n4 5 4 5\n4 8 4 8\n4 4 4 4\n4 8 4 8\n</answer>",

The value at (4,4) in the input is 7, and the output grid's center value is 3, which is the value to the right of the center in the input grid.\n\n### Step 3: Examine the Relationship Between Input and Output\nLet's directly compare the input and output grids for all examples to identify a pattern.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The center of the input is 7, and the output grid's values are related to the values around the center in the input. Specifically, the output is:\n   - Center value (3) is taken from the input grid at position (4,6) or the 3rd column from the center in the row below the center.\n   - The rest of the output grid values are 2, which is the value at the center of the 3x3 sub-grid around the center in the input.\n\n2. **Example 2**: The output grid's center is 8, which is the different value in the input grid. The rest are 0, which is the different value in the sub-grid around the center.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The center of the output is 8, and it's related to the values around the center (7) in the input.\n\n4. **Example 4**: The output grid's center is 3 (different value in the sub-grid around the center), and the rest are 5 (the different value in the input grid).\n\n5. **Example 5**: The output grid's center is 8, and the rest are 4, which follows a similar pattern.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Common Rule\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the output grid is formed by taking the value that is different from the majority in the 3x3 sub-grid centered around the center of the input grid for the center of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the value that is different from the majority in the input grid.\n\nLet's verify this rule with the examples:\n- **Example 1**: The different value around the center (7,7) is 3 (at (7,6)), and the different value in the input grid is 2 (3, 2, 3). So, the output is 2 2 2 / 2 3 2 / 2 2 2.\n- **Example 2**: The different value around the center is 8, and the different value in the input is 0 (or 8, considering the context). So, the output is 0 0 0 / 0 8 0 / 0 0 0.\n- **Example 3**: The different value around the center is 8, and the different value in the input grid is 7. So, the output is 7 7 7 / 7 8 7 / 7 7 7.\n- **Example 4**: The different value around the center is 5, and the different value in the input grid is 5. So, the output is 5 5 5 / 5 3 5 / 5 5 5.\n- **Example 5**: The different value around the center is 8, and the different value in the input grid is 4 (or 8, but 4 is the value different from 9 and 8).

The 3x3 sub-grid around the center has values:\n4 4 4\n4 4 4\n4 7 7\n\nThe different value in this sub-grid is 7. The different value in the entire input grid is 2 (since 7 and 2 are different from 4).\n\nThus, applying the rule: the center of the output grid should be 7 (the different value in the 3x3 sub-grid around the center), and the rest should be 2 (the most different value in the input grid, which is not the majority value 4).\n\nThe output grid should be a 3x3 grid:\n2 2 2\n2 7 2\n2 2 2\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2\n2 7 2\n2 2 2\n</answer>\n\n<answer>2 2 2\n2 7 2\n2 2 2</answer>",

Looking at the input grid, the central element of the output grid (3) corresponds to the central element of a 3x3 sub-grid in the input grid (2). The other elements in the output grid are the same (2), which corresponds to the most frequent or a specific element in the surrounding area of the input grid.\n\n### Step 2: Detailed Analysis of Examples\nLet's examine the central cell and its surroundings in each example to identify a pattern.\n\n1. **Example 1**: Central element in input is '2', and it's surrounded by '3's. The output central element is '3', which is the distinct element in the 3x3 sub-grid centered at '2'. The rest of the output grid elements are '2', which is the central element of the input sub-grid.\n\n2. **Example 2**: Central element is '7', surrounded by '8's. Output central element is '8'. The rest are '0', corresponding to the central element '0' in the input sub-grid.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Central element is '7', surrounded by '8's. Output central element is '8'. The rest are '7', corresponding to the central element '7'.\n\n4. **Example 4**: Central element is '4' (or considered in the context of its neighborhood), with '5' being distinct in the sub-grid. Output central element is '3', which is not the central element but corresponds to the distinct non-'4'/'3' element ('5') in the sub-grid. The rest are '5', which is the distinct element.\n\n5. **Example 5**: Central element is '9', with '4' being the distinct element in the sub-grid. Output central element is '8', corresponding to the '8's around '9'. The rest are '4', the distinct element in the sub-grid.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Pattern\nUpon closer inspection:\n- The size of the output grid seems to be related to the size of the input grid, specifically, it appears to be a smaller grid that corresponds to a certain sub-grid or pattern within the input grid.\n- The output grid elements appear to be derived from the elements within a certain neighborhood or sub-grid in the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples, it seems the output grid is centered around a particular sub-grid of the input and involves identifying a distinct or central element within a neighborhood.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Observed Pattern\nLet's directly analyze the pattern:\n- The output grid size is smaller and seems to be related to extracting a sub-grid or pattern from the input.\n- The central element of the output grid often corresponds to a distinct element or a specific pattern in the input grid's corresponding sub-grid.\n\nUpon a detailed review, a clear rule emerges: The output grid is formed by taking a sub-grid of the input grid (typically centered), and the elements of the output grid are determined by the central element and the distinct or different elements within the corresponding sub-grids or neighborhoods in the input.\n\n### Step 5: Specific Rule Identification\nThe rule appears to be: \n1. The output grid is a 3x3 grid centered around a specific sub-grid or pattern in the input grid.\n2. The central element of the output grid is the distinct or different element surrounding the central cell of the considered sub-grid in the input.\n3. The other elements of the output grid are the central element of their corresponding 3x3 sub-grids in the input.\n\nLet's directly check the given test input grid:\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 7 7 7\n4 4 4 7 2 7\n4 4 4 7 7 7\n\n### Step 6: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nTo generate the output grid, we need to look at the sub-grid that would correspond to a 3x3 output. Focusing on the central area:\n- The relevant input sub-grid is centered around the transition area.\n\nThe central element in the input is '4', and the distinct element in its 3x3 neighborhood is '7'. Thus, the central output element should correspond to '7' or the distinct element.\n\nFor the given input, considering the sub-grid around the central area:\n- The central element is between '4' and '7'. The distinct element in this neighborhood is '7'.\n\nOutput grid calculation:\n- Central element: The neighborhood around the central '4' (or the area between '4' and '7') includes '7', so the central output is '7' or related to '7'/'2'.\n- The distinct element in the 3x3 sub-grid centered at the position corresponding to the output grid's center is '2', as it's the distinct element ('2') within '7's.\n\nThus, the output should have '2' as the central element because '2' is the distinct element within the '7's.\n\nThe output grid:\n2 2 2\n2 7 2\n2 2 2\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2\n2 7 2\n2 2 2\n</answer>\n\n<answer>2 2 2\n2 7 2\n2 2 2</answer>",

Looking at the input grid, the center of the output grid corresponds to the center of the input grid. The value in the output grid seems to be related to the values in the input grid.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Pattern in Example 1\nUpon closer inspection, the center cell of the input grid is not directly copied to the output. Instead, the output grid values seem to be derived from the input grid. The output grid's center is 3 (from the input grid's 2 at position (3,3)), and the rest are 2, which is the value that appears most frequently around the center in a specific pattern or the value that is not the majority in its immediate neighborhood.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Further Examples\nLet's examine the other examples to identify a pattern.\n\n- In Example 2, the input grid has a '0' at (5,2), and the output grid has '8' at its center, corresponding to the input's (5,2) being '0'. The output is 3x3.\n- In Example 3, the central value '7' in the input is output as '8' in the output grid.\n- In Example 4, '5' is output at the center, corresponding to the '5' in the input grid.\n- In Example 5, '4' is output, corresponding to the '4' in the input.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the examples, it appears that the output grid takes the center value of the input grid (or a value from a specific position relative to the center) and possibly applies some transformation or uses neighboring values. However, a simpler pattern is observed:\n- The center cell of the output grid is the non-majority or a specific value from the neighborhood in the input grid.\n\nUpon a detailed review:\n- Example 1: The center of the input is '2', and it's surrounded by '3's. The output center is '3', and the rest are '2'.\n- Example 2: The center is '7', and there's a '0' nearby. The output reflects a value from the neighborhood ('8' is at the center).\n- Example 3: '7' is at the center, and '8's are around it. The output center is '8'.\n- Example 4: '4' is at the center, and '5' is around it. The output center is '5', and the rest are '5' or reflect the non-'4' value.\n- Example 5: '9's are the majority, '8's and '4' are not. The output reflects '4', which is a distinct value.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Rule\nThe output grid seems to be derived by taking a 3x3 sub-grid around the center of the input grid. The center of the output grid is the value that is not the majority (or a distinct value) in this 3x3 sub-grid. The rest of the output grid cells are filled with the value that is distinct or less frequent in the 3x3 neighborhood.\n\n### Step 6: Apply the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 7 7 7\n4 4 4 7 2 7\n4 4 4 7 7 7\n\nThe center of the input grid is between (3,3) and (4,3), so we consider the 3x3 grid around (4,3) or the effective center. The 3x3 sub-grid around (4,3) is:\n4 4 4\n4 7 7\n4 7 2\n\nHere, '4' is the majority, and '2' and '7' are not. '7' is more frequent than '2'. The distinct or less frequent value is '2'. Thus, the center of the output should be '2'. The rest of the output grid is filled with '7' or another distinct value, but based on the pattern, it seems the rest are filled with the less frequent or distinct value around the center, which is '2' in this case.\n\nOutput:\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n</answer> is the solution.",

The '7' in the second column of the seventh row changes to '2'.\n2. **Example 2**: The third column's value in the first row changes to '2'.\n3. **Example 3**: The second column's value in the third row changes to '2'.\n4. **Example 4**: The second column's value in the first row changes to '2'.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it seems the rule isn't directly related to the absolute or relative position being consistent across all examples. However, a more subtle pattern is observed: the change occurs in the second column.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the changes with a focus on the second column:\n- **Example 1**: Seventh row, second column '8' becomes '2'.\n- **Example 2**: First row, second column '6' remains '6', but third column '8' becomes '2'.\n- **Example 3**: Third row, second column '5' becomes '2'.\n- **Example 4**: First row, second column '1' becomes '2'.\n\nIt appears that the rule involves changing a value in the grid to '2', specifically targeting the second column.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nInput:\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n4 9 4 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n\nTo apply the rule, we need to identify the correct position to change to '2'. Based on the observation that the change occurs in the second column, let's directly examine the second column for a potential change.\n\nThe fourth row has '4' in the first column and '9' in the second column. If we follow the pattern of changing a value in the second column to '2', we should look for the first or a significant occurrence from the top.\n\nThus, changing '9' (second column) in the fourth row to '2' because it follows the pattern seen where an alteration in the second column occurs.\n\nOutput Grid:\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n4 2 4 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n<answer>\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n4 2 4 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n4 2 4 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n</answer>",

The second element in this row is '9', which should change to '2'.\n\nThus, applying the rule, the output grid should be:\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n4 2 4 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n<answer>\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n4 2 4 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n</answer>\n\n<answer>9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n4 2 4 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9</answer>",

Specifically, the value at each position in the output grid seems to be determined by whether the sum of its row and column indices is even or odd.\n\n### Rule Identification\nLet's examine if the pattern follows a simple rule based on the position (row, column) of each cell:\n- For Example 1, the output grid alternates between 9 and 7.

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given examples and identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Example 1\nIn Example 1, the input grid has a specific pattern where the middle elements of the grid are different from the rest. However, upon closer inspection, we see that the output grid is identical to the input grid. This suggests that the rule might not alter the grid if it follows a certain pattern or condition.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Example 2\nIn Example 2, the input grid has some variations in the middle, but the output grid is again identical to the input grid. This reinforces the observation from Example 1.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Example 3\nIn Example 3, the input grid has a different pattern, and again, the output grid is the same as the input grid. This further supports the idea that the rule might be to leave the grid unchanged.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Common Rule\nFrom all the examples given, it is evident that the output grid is always the same as the input grid. There is no transformation or alteration applied to the input grid to obtain the output grid.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 6 6 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 6 6 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n```\nApplying the identified rule (leaving the grid unchanged), the output grid will be the same as the input grid.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 6 6 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 6 6 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given examples to identify a pattern or rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\nIn the first example, the input grid is:\n9 7 9 7 9 7 9\n7 9 7 9 7 9 7\n9 7 9 8 8 7 9\n7 9 7 8 8 9 7\n9 7 9 7 9 7 9\n7 9 7 9 7 9 7\n9 7 9 7 9 7 9\n7 9 7 9 7 9 7\n9 7 9 7 9 7 9\n\nAnd the output grid is the same as the input grid. Notably, the input grid has a specific pattern where the values alternate between 9 and 7, except for the central 2x2 sub-grid where the values are 8.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\nIn the second example, the input grid is:\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n6 4 4 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n3 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n6 6 6 6 6 6 4 4 6 6 6\n3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3 3 3\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nAnd the output grid is:\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nThe output grid ignores the anomalies (values 4) in the input grid and follows the original pattern of alternating between 3 and 6.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\nIn the third example, the input grid is:\n4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 6 6 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnd the output grid is:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHere, the output grid corrects the input grid to follow a strict alternating pattern between 4 and 0.\n\n### Rule Identification\nFrom the given examples, it appears that the rule is to correct or simplify the input grid to follow a specific, simpler pattern. In all cases, the output grid follows a pattern that is determined by the position of the cells (e.g., alternating values based on the row and column index).\n\nSpecifically, the pattern seems to be related to the parity of the row and column indices:\n- In Example 1, the value is 9 if the sum of the row and column indices is even, and 7 if it's odd, except for the central anomaly.\n- In Example 2, the pattern alternates between 3 and 6 based on the row index.\n- In Example 3, the value alternates between 4 and 0 based on the row index.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it seems that the rule could be related to the row index, with the output value at each row being determined by whether the row index is even or odd.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nThe test input grid is:\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 6 6 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 6 6 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n\nLet's apply the observed rule:\n- For even row indices (0, 2, 4, ...), the output should be 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8.\n- For odd row indices (1, 3, 5, ...), the output should be 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n\n<answer>\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n</answer>\n\n<answer>0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0\n0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this problem, let's first analyze the given examples to identify a pattern or rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\nIn the first example, the input grid contains several distinct numbers (4, 8, 5), and the output grid shows a transformation where the number 8 in the input grid is associated with the number 5 in the output grid, and there's an additional change involving the number 8 appearing in the output grid at a position corresponding to a different number in the input grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of All Examples\n\n1. **Identify Distinct Numbers and Their Transformations:**\n   - In each example, identify the distinct numbers and how they transform from the input grid to the output grid.\n\n2. **Look for Patterns:**\n   - Analyze the positions of distinct numbers in the input grids and their corresponding values in the output grids.\n\n3. **Common Rule Across Examples:**\n   - Upon examining the examples, it appears that the rule involves changing the values around certain distinct numbers.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given examples:\n\n- **Example 1:** The number 8 in the input is associated with 5 in the output. The output grid seems to \"extend\" or \"transform\" the 8s into 5s in a certain pattern.\n- **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, the numbers 6 and 9 in the input grid are associated with changes in the output grid, where 6 is somewhat extended, and 9 remains 9 but is surrounded by an extension of 6.\n- **Example 3:** The numbers 9 and 4 in the input grid are associated with changes. The 9s remain, and the area around certain numbers is transformed into 4s.\n- **Example 4:** The numbers 7 and 5 in the input grid are transformed. The 7s and 5s are extended or changed in the output grid.\n- **Example 5:** The numbers 5 and 9 in the input grid are associated with changes. The area around certain numbers is transformed.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can observe that the rule seems to involve identifying a distinct number (or numbers) in the input grid and then applying a transformation that \"expands\" or \"changes\" the values around these distinct numbers to a specific output value.\n\n### Detailed Observation\n- The distinct numbers in each input grid (e.g., 8 in Example 1, 6 and 9 in Example 2) seem to trigger a transformation.\n- The transformation involves changing the values of neighboring cells to a specific number.\n\n### Identifying the Rule\nAfter analyzing the examples, it appears that the rule involves:\n1.

The output grid seems to \"extend\" or \"transform\" the 8s into 5s in a certain pattern.\n- **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, the numbers 6 and 9 in the input grid are associated with changes in the output grid, where 6 is somewhat extended, and 9 remains 9 but is surrounded by an extension of 6.\n- **Example 3:** The numbers 9 and 4 in the input grid are associated with changes. The 9s remain, and the area around certain numbers is transformed into 4s.\n- **Example 4:** The numbers 7 and 5 in the input grid are transformed. The 7s and 5s are extended or changed in the output grid.\n- **Example 5:** The numbers 5 and 9 in the input grid are associated with changes. The area around certain numbers is transformed.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can observe that the rule seems to involve identifying a distinct number (or numbers) in the input grid and then applying a transformation that \"expands\" or \"changes\" the values around these distinct numbers to a specific output value.\n\n### Detailed Observation\n- The distinct numbers in each input grid (e.g., 8 in Example 1, 6 and 9 in Example 2) seem to trigger a transformation.\n- The transformation involves changing the values of neighboring cells to a specific number.\n\n### Identifying the Rule\nAfter analyzing the examples, it appears that the rule involves:\n1.

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given examples to identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\nIn the first example, the input grid contains several distinct numbers (4, 8, 5), and the output grid seems to have a pattern related to the positions and values of these numbers. Specifically, the number 8 in the input grid is associated with the number 5 in the output grid, and this change seems to propagate outward.\n\n### Step 2: Detailed Analysis of Example 1\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the number 8 in the input grid is replaced by 5 in the output grid, and the surrounding 4s are also changed to 5s, effectively creating a larger \"blob\" of 5s around where the 8s were. This suggests a rule where the presence of a distinct number (like 8) causes a transformation in the output grid.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Other Examples\nLet's examine the other examples to confirm if a similar rule applies.\n\n- In Example 2, the numbers 6 and 9 in the input grid are associated with changes in the output grid, where 6 is surrounded by 6s and 9 remains 9 but is also surrounded by a pattern.\n- In Example 3, the numbers 9 and 4 in the input grid are associated with changes, where 4 and 9 are propagated.\n- In Example 4, the numbers 7 and 5 in the input grid are associated with a change to 7 in the output grid around their positions.\n- In Example 5, the numbers 5 and 9 in the input grid are associated with a change to 9 in the output grid.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Common Rule\nFrom the examples, it seems that when a grid contains a distinct number (different from the background number), the output grid changes the background number to this distinct number in a rectangular area surrounding the distinct numbers in the input grid. More precisely, the rule appears to be that the distinct numbers (not equal to the background) in the input grid cause the background number to change to the distinct number in a rectangular bounding box around the distinct numbers.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nThe test input grid has a background of 2 and distinct numbers 7 and 0. The 7s are located at (4,3), (7,10-12), and (14,5), and the 0s are at (13,6) and (15,6). To apply the rule, we need to identify the bounding box around these distinct numbers.\n\nThe minimum and maximum x coordinates for the distinct numbers are 3 and 15 (since 0-based indexing is assumed for the grid positions), and the minimum and maximum y coordinates are 3 and 12 (for the 7s) and 5 and 6 (for the 0s), resulting in an overall bounding box that encompasses all these points.\n\nThus, the bounding box for the 7s is from (3,3) to (15,12), and for the 0s, it's from (5,6) to (6,13), but since the 0s are within the larger area influenced by the 7s, we consider the overall effect.\n\n### Step 6: Generating the Output Grid\nThe output grid should have 2s outside the bounding box defined by the minimum and maximum coordinates of the distinct numbers (7 and 0), and 7s inside this box because 7 is the distinct number that appears most prominently and is not the background. However, upon closer inspection, it seems the rule might simply be related to changing the grid values based on the presence of distinct numbers.\n\nLet's directly analyze and apply:\n- The distinct numbers are 7 and 0.\n- The bounding box around these numbers is from (3,3) to (15,6) considering both 7 and 0.\n\nThe grid should change to 7 within this bounding box.\n\n### Step 7: Output Grid Generation\nGiven the input grid:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 7 2 2 2 2 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThe output grid, based on the identified rule, should change to 7 within the bounding box around the distinct numbers.\n\nThe bounding box is from (3,3) to (15,6).\n\nThus, the area from row 3 to 6 and column 3 to 15 should be filled with 7.\n\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2\n2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2\n2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2\n2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 7 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2\n2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2\n2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2\n2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 7 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid based on the given examples, we need to analyze the patterns and changes occurring from the input to the output in each example.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid contains several distinct numbers (4, 8, 5), and the output grid shows a transformation where the number 8 in the input grid is associated with the number 5 in the output grid in certain positions, and the number 8 in the first column is associated with 5.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Example 2\n\nIn Example 2, a similar pattern is observed where the presence of 6 and 9 in the input grid influences the output, with 6 and 9 spreading to adjacent cells or being associated with a different number.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Example 3\n\nExample 3 shows that the numbers 9 in the input grid are associated with the number 4 in the output grid in certain positions, spreading or changing values.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Example 4\n\nIn Example 4, the numbers 7 and 5 in the input grid are associated with the number 7 in the output grid, indicating a possible rule related to the distinct numbers and their positions.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing Example 5\n\nExample 5 indicates that the numbers 5 and 9 in the input grid are associated with the number 9 in the output grid, showing a spreading or transformation pattern based on the distinct numbers.\n\n### Step 6: Identifying the Common Rule\n\nUpon closer inspection of all examples, a pattern emerges where the distinct numbers (not equal to the background number) in the input grid seem to influence the output grid. Specifically, it appears that these distinct numbers either spread to adjacent cells or are transformed into another distinct number in the output.\n\nThe common rule observed across the examples is that the distinct numbers (other than the background number) in the input grid tend to spread or transform into a specific pattern in the output grid. For instance, in Example 1, the \"8\"s are associated with \"5\"s in certain configurations. In Example 5, the \"5\"s and \"9\"s are associated with \"9\"s spreading.\n\nHowever, upon a detailed review, a simpler and more consistent rule is observed:\n- The background value remains unchanged.\n- The distinct numbers (e.g., 8 in Example 1, 6 and 9 in Example 2, etc.) seem to cause a transformation or spreading.\n\nA specific rule that fits all examples is related to how the distinct numbers interact with their surroundings and how they transform or spread.\n\n### Step 7: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nLet's directly analyze the test input grid and apply the observed pattern.\n\nThe test input grid is:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 7 2 2 2 2 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 7 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\nGiven the distinct numbers are 7 and 0, and following the observed pattern in the examples, the output can be derived by analyzing how these numbers influence their surroundings.\n\nThe output grid, based on the pattern observed, should reflect a transformation or spreading related to the distinct numbers 7 and 0.\n\nLet's directly infer the output based on the given examples and the test input.\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n</answer>",

The inner cells (not on the border of the shape formed by 7) are changed to 1.\n\n#### Example 3:\nAgain, the output is the same as the input except for the inner cells of the shape formed by 8, which are changed to 1.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Rule\n\nFrom the examples, we can infer that the rule is to identify a distinct shape or pattern formed by a number different from the background, and then change the inner cells (not on the border of this shape) to 1.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nFirst, identify the distinct shape or pattern. Here, the number 0 forms a distinct shape against the background of 6.\n\nLet's identify the cells that are inside the shape formed by 0 and not on its border.\n\n1. The shape formed by 0 is:\n   - Row 3: Columns 1-8 (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)\n   - Row 4: Columns 1, 5, 8 (0, 0, 0)\n   - Row 5: Columns 1-8 (0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)\n   - Row 9: Columns 1-6 (0 0 0 0 0 0)\n   - Row 10: Columns 1, 6 (0, 0)\n\n2. The border of this shape includes:\n   - Row 3: Columns 1-8\n   - Row 5: Columns 1-8\n   - Column 1: Rows 3-5\n   - Column 8: Rows 3-5 (partially, as it's part of the border in row 4 as well)\n   - Row 9: Columns 1-6\n   - Row 10: Columns 1 and 6\n\nThe inner cells that are not on the border are:\n- Row 4: Column 5 (since it's surrounded by 0s)\n\nThus, we need to change the cell at Row 4, Column 5 to 1.\n\n### Step 4: Generating the Output Grid\n\nApplying the rule to the test input grid:\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nBecomes:\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 1 6 6 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 1 6 6 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n</answer>",

Specifically, the cells that are completely surrounded by the same different value (i.e., they are isolated within a different number) are changed to '1'.\n\nLet's verify this rule with the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: The cells with value '2' that are surrounded by '5' are changed to '1'.\n2. **Example 2**: The cells with value '7' that are surrounded by '8' are changed to '1'.\n3. **Example 3**: The cells with value '8' that are surrounded by '5' are changed to '1'.\n\nThe rule appears to be consistent across the examples.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nTo apply the rule, we need to identify cells that are completely surrounded by a different value.\n\n1. The '6's surrounded by '0's should be changed to '1'.\n\nLet's identify such cells:\n- In the third row, the '6' is not surrounded by '0's.\n- The '6' in the fourth row, second column is surrounded by '0's.\n\nAfter applying the rule:\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 1 1 1 1 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nThe output grid is:\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 1 1 1 1 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\n<answer>\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 1 1 1 1 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 1 1 1 1 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n```",

For instance, in Example 1, the sub-grid with the value '5' is within a grid of '2's.\n\n2. **Modification Rule**: The elements within this sub-grid that are surrounded by the same value (i.e., not on the edge of the sub-grid) and are of the same value as the sub-grid are changed to '1'. More specifically, it seems that the rule applies to the inner elements of the sub-grid, making them '1' if they are completely surrounded by the sub-grid's value.\n\nLet's directly apply the observed pattern to the given test input grid.\n\n### Test Input Grid\n\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nThe sub-grid with a different value is '0'. Let's identify the inner part of this sub-grid and change it to '1'.\n\nThe '0' sub-grid is:\n- Row 3 to 5 and Row 9 to 9 (since it's not a single block but two separate blocks, we need to consider them separately).\n- Column 3 to 8 (for the first block) and Column 1 to 6 (for the second block, but it's not a perfect rectangle).\n\nLet's directly analyze the grid:\n- The first '0' sub-grid (from Row 3 to 5, Column 1 to 8) has inner '0's that are completely surrounded by '0's. The cell at (4, 4) is such a cell.\n\nApplying the rule:\n- Change the inner '0' at (4, 4) to '1'.\n\nThe resulting output grid will be:\n\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\n<answer>\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n0 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n```",

The output is 1.\n   - In Example 2, the input grid has a different pattern with numbers 8 and 6, and the output is again 1.\n   - In Example 3, the pattern involves numbers 1 and 2, and the output is 6.\n\n2. **Analyze the Outputs:**\n   - The outputs are not directly related to the values within the grid (e.g., sum, average) since the outputs are simple integers (1 or 6) despite the varying numbers in the input grids.\n   - The fact that Example 1 and Example 2 have the same output (1) despite different input values and patterns suggests that the rule might not depend on the specific values but rather on some characteristic of the grid or pattern.\n\n3. **Look for Common Characteristics:**\n   - Upon closer inspection, we can see that in Example 1 and Example 2, the grids have a dominant number (2 in Example 1 and 8 in Example 2) that is consistent across most of the grid, with a smaller number (6 in both examples) appearing in a less dominant pattern. The output is 1 in both cases.\n   - In Example 3, the dominant number is 1, and the less dominant number is 2. The output is 6.\n\n4. **Identify the Rule:**\n   - Let's count the number of cells that are different from the dominant number in each example:\n     - Example 1: The dominant number is 2. There are 6 cells with the number 6, so the count is 6. Output is 1.\n     - Example 2: The dominant number is 8. There are 6 cells with the number 6, so the count is 6. Output is 1.\n     - Example 3: The dominant number is 1. There are 6 cells with the number 2, so the count is 6. Output is 6.\n   - It seems the count of non-dominant cells is 6 in all examples. However, the output differs between Example 1/2 and Example 3.\n\n5. **Re-evaluate the Rule:**\n   - Upon a more detailed examination, we can observe:\n     - The output might be related to the count of the non-dominant number or a characteristic of the pattern formed by the non-dominant number.\n     - In all examples, the count of the less dominant number is 6. \n     - The outputs are either 1 or 6. Let's directly check if the output is related to whether the less dominant number is greater than the dominant number.\n\n6. **Apply the Observation:**\n   - In Example 1 and Example 2, the less dominant number (6) is greater than the dominant number (2 and 8, respectively). The output is 1.\n   - In Example 3, the less dominant number (2) is greater than the dominant number (1), and the output is 6.\n\n7. **Formulate the Rule:**\n   - The rule seems to be related to the comparison between the dominant and less dominant numbers and possibly the count or presence of the less dominant number.\n\nGiven the provided examples and analysis, let's directly check the given test input grid.\n\n### Test Input:\n4 3 3\n4 3 3\n3 4 4\n\n- Dominant number: 3 (if we consider the count) or could be argued as 4 based on a different perspective, but 3 appears more frequently.\n- Less dominant number: 4.\n\nCount of less dominant number (4): 4 cells.\n\nLet's directly apply a potential rule based on observations:\n- The less dominant number (4) is greater than the dominant number (3).\n\nIf we follow a rule that could potentially fit (like the count or comparison), we need a clear rule.\n\n### Potential Rule:\nIf the less dominant number is greater than the dominant number, the output could be related to the count of the less dominant number.\n\n### Applying to Test Input:\n- Dominant number: 3\n- Less dominant number: 4\n- Count of 4: 4\n\nLet's hypothesize the output is the count of the less dominant number.\n\nThus, for the test input grid:\n4 3 3\n4 3 3\n3 4 4\n\nThe count of 4 is 4.\n\n<answer>4</answer>",

The output is 1.\n2. **Example 2**: The input grid has a pattern where 6 is surrounded by 8s. Again, the output is 1.\n3. **Example 3**: The input grid has a pattern with 2s surrounded by 1s. The output is 6.\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that the output corresponds to the number that is surrounded by a different number within the grid.\n\n### Analysis:\n- In **Example 1**, 6 is surrounded by 2, and the output is 1, which doesn't directly relate to 6 or 2. \n- In **Example 2**, 6 is surrounded by 8, and the output is again 1.\n- In **Example 3**, 2 is surrounded by 1, and the output is 6.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that the output is actually the number that is \"different\" or \"surrounded\" within the grid. However, the output doesn't directly match the surrounded number or the surrounding number. Let's directly analyze the pattern:\n\n- The output seems to be related to the count or the presence of a different number within a uniform background.\n\nLet's directly check the hypothesis that the output is related to the number that is different from the majority or background number:\n\n1. **Example 1**: The background is 2, and 6 is different. The count of 6 (or its presence) could be related to the output.\n2. **Example 2**: The background is 8, and 6 is different. Again, the count or presence of 6.\n3. **Example 3**: The background is 1, and 2 is different. Here, the output is 6, which is not directly the count of 2 but could be related to the configuration or count of 2.\n\nLet's directly count the occurrences of the \"different\" number in each grid:\n- **Example 1**: Count of 6 is 6.\n- **Example 2**: Count of 6 is 6.\n- **Example 3**: Count of 2 is 6.\n\nIt seems the output is actually the count of the number that is different from the background.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nInput:\n4 3 3\n4 3 3\n3 4 4\n\nHere, 4 is the number that is different from the background 3. Let's count the occurrences of 4:\n- The count of 4 is 4.\n\nThus, the predicted output should be the count of 4, which is 4.\n\n<answer>4</answer>",

The values in the output grid correspond to specific elements in the input grid.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Rule\n\nLet's analyze the positions of the elements in the output grid with respect to the input grid.\n\n1. The top-left element of the output grid (2) is at position (4,1) or (5,2) if we consider 1-based indexing and the grid as a matrix, but more precisely, it seems to be related to the elements around the center or a specific pattern.\n2. Upon closer inspection, the output grid seems to be formed by taking a subset of elements from the input grid.\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Analysis\n\nAnalyzing the given examples:\n\n- In Example 1, the output grid seems to be related to the elements at specific positions in the input grid. If we consider the input grid as a 15x15 grid, the output grid corresponds to the elements at positions that form a 4x4 grid centered around a certain pattern or anomaly in the input grid.\n\nLet's directly examine the relationship between input and output for all examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Output grid is a 4x4 matrix where elements are directly taken from specific positions in the input grid. It seems to capture a \"pattern\" or \"anomaly\" in the grid.\n2. **Example 2**: Similar observation as Example 1.\n3. **Example 3**: The output grid again corresponds to a specific 4x4 sub-grid within the input grid, capturing the \"anomaly\" or distinct pattern.\n\n### Step 5: Understanding the Pattern\n\nUpon detailed analysis, it becomes clear that the output grid is a 4x4 grid that captures the \"distinct\" or \"non-background\" values or patterns in the input grid. The exact positions are related to where these distinct patterns or values are located.\n\n### Step 6: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nThe test input grid is:\n```\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 6 6 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 3 9 9 1 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 3 9 9 1 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2 2 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n```\n\nTo predict the output, we need to identify the 4x4 grid that corresponds to the \"distinct\" pattern.\n\n### Step 7: Predicting the Output\n\nThe distinct elements in the input grid are '6', '3', '1', '2', '8'. Focusing on these, the relevant 4x4 sub-grid seems to be centered around these values.\n\nLet's directly identify the corresponding output:\n- The values '9', '9', '9', '6', '9', '9', '3', '9', '9', '9', '3', '9', '9', '2', '2', '9' form a 4x4 grid when considering the positions (2,9), (2,10), (3,9), (3,10), (9,10), (9,11), (10,10), (10,11), (4,9), (4,10), (5,9), (5,10), (13,9), (13,10), (14,9), (14,10) or a similar pattern.\n\nHowever, directly extracting based on observed examples:\nThe output grid is:\n```\n9 6 6 9\n9 3 9 1\n9 3 9 1\n9 2 2 9\n```\n\n<answer>\n9 6 6 9\n9 3 9 1\n9 3 9 1\n9 2 2 9\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>9 6 6 9\n9 3 9 1\n9 3 9 1\n9 2 2 9</answer>",

It captures a 4x4 grid that encompasses the distinct elements.\n\n2. **Example 2**: Similarly, the output is a 4x4 grid that captures the distinct elements.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The output grid again corresponds to a 4x4 sub-grid that includes the distinct elements.\n\n4. **Example 4**: The same pattern is observed.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Rule\n\nThe rule appears to be extracting a 4x4 grid from the input that centers around the distinct or non-uniform elements. To precisely define the rule, let's analyze the positions:\n\n- In Example 1, the distinct elements are around the center. The 4x4 grid starts at (4,2).\n- In Example 2, it starts at (8,2).\n- In Example 3, it starts at (5,5).\n- In Example 4, it starts at (3,4).\n\nUpon a detailed review, we can observe that the rule involves extracting a 4x4 sub-grid. The top-left corner of this grid seems to be positioned such that it captures the area with the most distinct or notable elements.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nGiven the input grid:\n```\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 6 6 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 3 9 9 1 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 3 9 9 1 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2 2 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n```\nThe distinct elements are at positions involving 6, 3, 1, 2, and 8. Focusing on the area that includes these elements, we see that the 4x4 grid that captures the essence starts at (2,9) or more precisely, considering 1-based indexing and the area of interest, it is around the elements 9, 3, 1, 2, 6, and 8.\n\nLet's directly identify the 4x4 sub-grid:\n- The elements 6, 3, 1, and 2 are key. \n- The top-left of the 4x4 grid seems to be at row 2 and column 9 (1-based indexing), which gives us the sub-grid.\n\nThus, extracting the 4x4 grid:\n```\n9 9 6 6\n9 9 3 9\n9 9 3 9\n9 9 9 2\n```\n\nThe output grid is:\n```\n9 6 6 9\n9 3 9 9\n9 3 9 1\n9 2 2 9\n```\n\nLet's format it as required.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n9 6 6 9\n9 3 9 9\n9 3 9 1\n9 2 2 9\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given examples to identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Structure of Input and Output Grids\n\nFirst, observe the dimensions of the input and output grids in the provided examples.\n\n- Example 1: Input is 15x15, and output is 4x4.\n- Example 2: Input is 15x13 (though the grid is not fully utilized), and output is 4x4.\n- Example 3: Input is 12x16 (again, not fully utilized), and the output is 4x4.\n- Example 4: Input is 12x12 (and again not fully utilized), and output is 4x4.\n\nThe output grid is consistently 4x4, suggesting that the rule involves extracting or transforming a subset of the input grid into a 4x4 grid.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Pattern\n\nLet's examine the input and output grids more closely to identify any patterns or rules.\n\nUpon closer inspection of the examples:\n\n- In Example 1, the output grid seems to be related to the \"anomalies\" or non-2 values in the input grid.\n- The same observation can be made in Examples 2, 3, and 4, where the output grids correspond to specific patterns or \"anomalies\" within the input grids.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Examination of Examples\n\nLet's analyze Example 1 in detail:\n- The input grid has dimensions 15x15, filled mostly with 2s, except for a few \"anomaly\" regions.\n- The output grid is a 4x4 grid that seems to capture the essence of these \"anomalies.\"\n\nUpon careful observation, it appears that the output grid is formed by capturing the values of these \"anomalies\" or distinct patterns within the input grid.\n\n### Step 4: Rule Identification\n\nAfter examining all examples, a clear rule emerges:\n- The output grid is a 4x4 representation of the \"distinct\" or \"anomalous\" values within the input grid.\n- Specifically, the rule involves identifying a central or significant pattern/anomaly in the input grid and representing it in a 4x4 format.\n\nLet's directly inspect the values:\n- In each example, the output grid corresponds to a specific 4x4 sub-grid within the input that contains the \"anomalies\" or distinct values.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 6 6 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 3 9 9 1 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 3 9 9 1 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2 2 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n```\n\nThe \"anomalies\" here are the non-9 values. Focusing on the region with these anomalies:\n- The values 6, 3, 3, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 2, 2, 9, 8, 8, 9 form a pattern.\n\nExtracting the relevant 4x4 sub-grid that corresponds to the anomalies:\n```\n9 6 6 9\n9 3 9 1\n9 3 9 1\n9 9 2 2\n```\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n```\n9 6 6 9\n9 3 9 1\n9 3 9 1\n9 2 2 9\n```\n\n<answer>\n9 6 6 9\n9 3 9 1\n9 3 9 1\n9 2 2 9\n</answer>\n\n<answer>9 6 6 9\n9 3 9 1\n9 3 9 1\n9 2 2 9</answer>",

Specifically, the different cell's value is propagated downwards and sometimes influences the cells diagonally or directly below/above it.\n\nLet's directly examine the pattern:\n- For a cell with a different value, its influence propagates down and potentially to the right (depending on its position relative to the grid and other different cells).\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nInput:\n```\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\nThe '7' at (3,3) is the different cell.

The value `2` is then influenced by `1`, changing its immediate neighbor's value to `1` in the output grid. Other cells remain unchanged or are influenced based on their neighbors.\n\n2. **Example 2**: The cell with value `4` influences the top-left to bottom-right diagonal and possibly its neighbors. The output shows that `4` directly affects the cell above it, changing `7` to `4`, and influences the cells diagonally (top-right direction).\n\n3. **Example 3**: The cell with value `6` is propagated downwards. The row with `4` influences the cells above and below it.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can observe that the non-dominant value (the value different from the majority in its neighborhood or the grid) tends to propagate or influence its neighbors in the output grid.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the transformation more systematically:\n\n- **Propagation and Influence**: In all examples, a distinct or non-dominant value within a uniform background tends to propagate or influence neighboring cells in the output.\n\n- **Specific Behavior**:\n  - The distinct value tends to move or influence in a downward direction or diagonally.\n  - The influence can sometimes be seen as \"bleeding\" into adjacent cells.\n\n### Common Rule\n\nThe common rule seems to involve the propagation or influence of distinct or non-dominant values within a grid. Let's simplify this observation:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Dominant Values**: Cells with values different from their neighbors or the dominant value in the grid.\n2. **Propagation**: These non-dominant values tend to propagate downwards or influence neighboring cells.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nInput:\n```\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\nLet's apply the observed rule:\n\n1. The value `7` is distinct and non-dominant.\n2. `7` influences or propagates to neighboring cells.\n\nBased on the observed behavior in the examples:\n\n- `7` will influence the cells around it, potentially changing their values to `7` or influencing them directly.\n\nLet's directly infer the output based on the rule that the distinct value (`7`) tends to influence or propagate:\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 7 7 7 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\nThus, the predicted output grid is:\n```\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 7 7 7 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\n<answer>\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 7 7 7 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 7 7 7 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 7 2 2\n1 2 2 2 2 2\n</answer>",

The rest of the output is 0 0 0 0.\n- In Example 2, the first row of the input has no zeros, but the output is still 5 5 for the first row if we consider the pattern of the rest of the examples. However, upon closer inspection, it seems the rule might not directly depend on the first row being all zeros.\n- In Example 3, the first row of the input is not all zeros, but the output starts with 0 0 0 0 0 0. The second and third rows are all 6s, and their corresponding outputs are 5 5 5 5 5 5.\n- In Example 4, the pattern continues, with the top rows having outputs of 5 if they are not the last row with a different value.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can notice that the output grid seems to be determined by the value in the cells of the input grid relative to the edges and the uniformity of the values.\n\nHowever, a simpler pattern emerges when looking at the structure of the outputs:\n- The output seems to be related to the presence of a specific value or pattern in the input grid, but more directly, it appears that the rule could be related to the position or the uniformity of the cell values.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given outputs:\n1. The output grids have values of either 0 or 5.\n2. Looking at the transition from input to output, it seems that the rule could be related to the maximum or minimum value in the grid or the uniformity of values across rows.\n\nUpon a detailed review:\n- It appears that if a row in the input grid contains a certain pattern or value, it maps to 5 in the output grid. Specifically, the rule seems to be that rows with uniform non-zero or specific values are mapped to 5.\n\nLet's directly inspect the pattern:\n- In all examples, rows that are uniform (all the same value) and not necessarily zero are mapped to 5 in the output.\n- The first row that is not uniform or contains a specific pattern (like being zero or having a certain value) is not directly correlated with the output. However, it seems that rows with the same value (especially non-zero) are mapped to 5.\n\nThe correct rule seems to be:\n- A row in the output grid is 5 if the corresponding row in the input grid has all the same values (uniform). Otherwise, it is 0.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\nInput:\n0 9 0\n0 0 0\n0 9 0\n\n1. The first row (0 9 0) is not uniform, so its output is 0 0 0.\n2.

The output grid has this `5` moved up one row. All other values remain `8`.\n   \n2. **Example 2**: The input grid has `9`s at specific positions. The output grid seems to reflect a transformation where the `9`s are moved or reflected.

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n\n## Step 1: Analyze Example 1\nIn Example 1, the input grid is a 4x5 grid with all elements being 8 except for one element which is 5. The output grid has the same elements as the input grid but the position of the 5 has moved up by one row. Specifically, the input grid has 5 at (3,2) and the output grid has 5 at (0,2) if we consider 0-based indexing.\n\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Example 2\nIn Example 2, the input grid is a 7x3 grid. Upon closer inspection, we see that the output grid is not a simple shift of the input grid. Let's examine the positions of the non-5 elements (which are 9 in this case). The 9s in the input grid are at positions (2,0), (4,0), and (4,1). In the output grid, the 9s are at positions (1,0), (1,1), and (3,0). It seems there's a specific rule applied to the non-matching elements (9 in this case).\n\n\n## Step 3: Detailed Examination of Example 2\nLet's look closely at the movement of 9s. The first 9 moves from (2,0) to (1,0), the second 9 moves from (4,0) to (1,1), and the third 9 moves from (4,1) to (3,0). This doesn't follow a simple shift pattern. Let's re-evaluate: the first occurrence of 9 moves up 1 row, and the subsequent 9s seem to follow a different pattern.\n\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Example 3\nExample 3 has a 1x4 grid with all elements being 5. The output is the same as the input. This suggests that if there's no \"different\" element (like 5 being different from 8 or 9 being different from 5), the grid remains unchanged.\n\n\n## Step 5: Re-evaluate the Rule Across Examples\nUpon re-evaluation, let's consider the possibility that the rule involves moving or changing the position of the \"different\" element(s) in the grid. In Example 1, the 5 (different from 8) moves up. In Example 2, the 9s (different from 5) seem to move in a way that the first 9 moves up and the rest follow a specific pattern.\n\n\n## Step 6: Identify the Pattern\nLet's closely examine the movement in Example 2 again. If we consider the first non-5 element (9 at (2,0)), it moves to (1,0). The next 9 (at (4,0)) moves to (1,1), and the last 9 (at (4,1)) moves to (3,0). This indicates a possible rule where the first different element moves up one row, and subsequent different elements are placed in a specific order or position.\n\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the Rule\nHowever, a simpler explanation could be that the first occurrence of the non-dominant element moves up one row, and other occurrences might follow a specific pattern or might be ignored/moved in a particular way.\n\n\n## Step 8: Apply the Observed Rule to the Test Input Grid\nThe test input grid is:\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n\nHere, 8 is the non-dominant element. It is at (0,1). If we apply a rule similar to what we observed (moving the non-dominant element up), 8 would move to the position above it, but since it's already at the first row, we need to consider what happens in such a case. If the rule simply involves moving the non-dominant element up one row, and there's no \"above\" row, the grid might remain unchanged or follow a different logic.\n\n\n## Step 9: Predict the Output Grid\nGiven the input grid:\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n\nThe non-dominant element (8) is at (0,1). Moving it up is not possible as it's in the first row. Let's directly analyze the given examples again for a clearer pattern.\n\n\n## Step 10: Reconsider the Examples for a Clear Pattern\nIn Example 1, the different element (5) moves up. In Example 2, the different elements (9s) move in a specific way. Notably, the first 9 moves up one row. Let's simplify: if an element is different from the dominant element, it moves up.\n\n\n## Step 11: Final Analysis\nFor the test grid:\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n\nThe dominant element is 1. The non-dominant element is 8. Moving 8 up is not possible as it's already in the top row. Thus, we need to directly apply the observed pattern or rule.\n\n\nThe final answer is: \n1 1 1\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n<answer>\n1 1 1\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n</answer>",

In Example 1, '5' is moved up. In Example 2, '9' is moved up.\n\nLet's re-examine the examples more closely:\n\n1. **Example 1**: The '5' is in the 4th row (0-indexed). It moves up to the top row where it replaces the '8'. The rest of the values below it shift down.\n\n2. **Example 2**: The first '9' is in the 3rd row. It moves up to the 2nd row (1-indexed to 0-indexed transition). The '9's in subsequent rows continue this pattern, moving up.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears the rule is to move the first occurrence of the non-majority value (if any) up by one row, and continue this process for subsequent occurrences.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nInput:\n```\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n```\nHere, '8' is the non-majority value. It is in the first row. Following the observed pattern, '8' should move up, but since it's already in the first row, we need to consider the rule's implication more carefully. The rule seems to be about shifting the non-majority value up. If we apply a similar logic as observed:\n\n- '8' is in the first row. There's no row above it to move into, so it stays.\n\nThus, the output should be similar to the input because '8' cannot move up further.\n\nOutput:\n```\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n```\n\nLet's directly format this as per the required output.\n\n<answer>\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n</answer>\n\n<answer>1 8 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1</answer>",

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the rule is simpler: the element that is different from the most common element in the grid or row changes to 5.\n\nLet's refine this:\n- In Example 1, 1 is different and becomes 5.\n- In Example 2, 2 and 8 are different from 1 and become 5.\n- In Example 3, 7 and 1 are different from 9 and become 5.\n- In Example 4, 6 is different from 8 and becomes 5.\n- In Example 5, 3 is different from 2 and becomes 5.\n\nThe rule seems to be that any element that is not the most frequent element in its row or grid changes to 5. However, looking closely, it seems the rule applies to elements that are different from the dominant value (usually the most frequent) in their immediate context or overall.\n\nUpon a detailed review, a simpler rule emerges: the elements that are not equal to the most common value in the grid change to 5.\n\n### Step 7: Apply the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 3 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 8 3 8\n8 2 8 8 8 3\n8 8 8 2 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nThe most common element in the grid is 8. So, any element that is not 8 should change to 5.\n\nLet's apply this rule:\n- Row 1: 8 8 8 8 3 8 -> 8 8 8 8 5 8\n- Row 2: 8 8 8 8 8 8 -> remains the same\n- Row 3: 8 8 3 8 3 8 -> 8 8 5 8 5 8\n- Row 4: 8 2 8 8 8 3 -> 8 5 8 8 8 5\n- Row 5: 8 8 8 2 8 8 -> 8 8 8 5 8 8\n- Row 6: 8 8 8 8 8 8 -> remains the same\n\nOutput Grid:\n8 8 8 8 5 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 5 8 5 8\n8 5 8 8 8 5\n8 8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n8 8 8 8 5 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 5 8 5 8\n8 5 8 8 8 5\n8 8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n</answer>",

However, a more precise rule can be derived by closely examining the changes.\n\n- In Example 1, the third element in the first row is different and becomes 5.\n- In Example 2, the first and third elements of the third row are different from the rest in their column and become 5.\n- In Example 3, the element in the third row, third column is different and becomes 5, and so do the elements in the first column from the third row onwards because they differ from the element above them.\n- In Example 4, elements that are different in their row become 5.\n- In Example 5, the element that is different in its row becomes 5.\n\n### Step 8: Apply the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 3 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 8 3 8\n8 2 8 8 8 3\n8 8 8 2 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nLet's analyze:\n- First row: 3 is different, so it becomes 5.\n- Second row: No change.\n- Third row: The third and fifth elements are 3, which are different, so they become 5.\n- Fourth row: The second element is 2, which is different, so it becomes 5, and the sixth element is 3, which is different, so it becomes 5.\n- Fifth row: The fourth element is 2, which is different, so it becomes 5.\n- Sixth row: No change.\n\nApplying the rule:\n- First row: 8 8 8 8 5 8\n- Second row: 8 8 8 8 8 8\n- Third row: 8 8 5 8 5 8\n- Fourth row: 8 5 8 8 8 5\n- Fifth row: 8 8 8 5 8 8\n- Sixth row: 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nOutput grid:\n8 8 8 8 5 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 5 8 5 8\n8 5 8 8 8 5\n8 8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n8 8 8 8 5 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 5 8 5 8\n8 5 8 8 8 5\n8 8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n</answer>",

The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Example 2\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n2 8 1 1 8\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n5 5 1 1 5\n\nHere, the input values '2' and '8' at positions (3,1) and (3,5) change to '5' in the output. The value '1' at (3,3) remains '1'. This suggests that not all different numbers change to '5', but there might be a pattern related to the position or the value itself.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Example 3\nInput:\n9 9 9\n9 9 9\n9 9 7\n7 9 9\n1 9 9\n7 9 9\nOutput:\n9 9 9\n9 9 9\n9 9 5\n5 9 9\n5 9 9\n5 9 9\n\nThe inputs '7' at (3,3), '7' at (4,1), '1' at (5,1), and '7' at (6,1) change to '5' in the output. This indicates that the change to '5' is not dependent on the input value being the same.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Example 4\nInput:\n8 8 6 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8\n8 6 8 6 8\n8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8\n8 5 8 5 8\n8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8\n\nThe '6's at (1,3), (3,2), and (3,4) change to '5' at (1,3) and (3,2,4) respectively in the output.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing Example 5\nInput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 3 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 5 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThe '3' at (4,2) changes to '5'.\n\n### Step 6: Identifying the Pattern\nFrom the examples, it is observed that the change to '5' occurs for the cell that is different from its surrounding cells (horizontally, vertically) and is not necessarily dependent on the value itself but rather its being different.\n\nLet's check the hypothesis that a cell changes to '5' if it is different from its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n\n1. **Example 1**: The cell (1,3) is '1', different from its neighbors ('8'), so it changes to '5'.\n2. **Example 2**: The cells (3,1) and (3,5) are '2' and '8', different from their neighbors, so they change to '5'.\n3. **Example 3**: The cells (3,3), (4,1), (5,1), and (6,1) are different from their neighbors, so they change to '5'.\n4. **Example 4**: The cells (1,3), (3,2), and (3,4) are '6', different from their immediate neighbors, so they change to '5'.\n5. **Example 5**: The cell (4,2) is '3', different from its neighbors ('2'), so it changes to '5'.\n\nThe pattern holds true for all given examples.\n\n### Step 7: Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 3 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 3 8 3 8\n8 2 8 8 8 3\n8 8 8 2 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nLet's apply the rule:\n- (1,5) is '3', different from its neighbors, so it changes to '5'.\n- (3,3) is '3', different from its neighbors ('8'), so it changes to '5'.\n- (3,5) is '3', different from its neighbors, so it changes to '5'.\n- (4,2) is '2', different from its neighbors ('8'), so it changes to '5'.\n- (4,6) is '3', different from its neighbors, so it changes to '5'.\n- (5,4) is '2', different from its neighbors ('8'), so it changes to '5'.\n\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 5 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 5 8 5 8\n8 5 8 8 8 5\n8 8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n8 8 8 8 5 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 5 8 5 8\n8 5 8 8 8 5\n8 8 8 5 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n</answer>",

Upon closer inspection, the output seems to be related to the central part of the input grid. The central 3x3 sub-grid of the input is:\n   ```\n   2 2 2\n   2 2 2\n   2 2 2\n   ```\n   However, the output is `4 4 2`. Let's look at the corners and the middle row/column. The first and last elements of the output (`4 4`) correspond to the values in the input grid that are not necessarily the majority in their respective 3x3 sub-grids centered around them, but `4` is present in the corners and middle row/column of the input grid.\n\n2. **Example 2**: The input is a 5x3 grid, and the output is a 2x1 grid (or simply two values). The central part of the input grid is:\n   ```\n   5 5 5\n   5 5 5\n   ```\n   The output is `5` and `8`. Here, `5` is the dominant value in the input grid, and `8` is a distinct value appearing at the borders.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The input is a 7x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid (though presented as a 3x3, let's directly analyze). The central 3x3 sub-grid of the input is:\n   ```\n   8 8 8\n   8 8 8\n   8 8 8\n   ```\n   The output is:\n   ```\n   8 0\n   0 0\n   0 0\n   ```\n   The top-left value (`8`) corresponds to the central value in the input grid, and the rest (`0`) corresponds to the less frequent border values or changes in the grid.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the rule might involve extracting or summarizing information from specific parts of the input grid, particularly focusing on the central values or the dominant and distinct values.\n\nLet's directly analyze the outputs given:\n- The outputs seem to be related to the central elements or the pattern observed in the input grids.\n- In **Example 1**, the output `4 4 2` seems to relate to the first row of the central 3x3 grid or significant values.\n- In **Example 2**, `5` and `8` are the dominant and a distinct border value, respectively.\n- In **Example 3**, the output reflects a pattern starting from the central value (`8`) and then possibly the border or less frequent values (`0`).\n\nLet's directly check if the outputs are related to the central part of the grid or a specific pattern.\n\nFor **Example 1**, if we look at the middle row (`2 2 2 2 2 2 2`), the output doesn't directly match. However, examining the grid, the values `4 4 2` could be related to significant or border values.\n\nFor **Example 2** and **Example 3**, the outputs seem to be related to significant or distinct values in the grid.\n\nLet's hypothesize that the rule involves:\n1. Identifying the most frequent (dominant) value in the grid.\n2. Identifying a distinct or significant border value.\n\n### Analyzing the Test Input Grid:\nInput:\n```\n3 3 8\n3 3 3\n8 3 8\n```\n1. The dominant value is `3`.\n2. A distinct or significant border value is `8`.\n\nFollowing the observed pattern in the examples, particularly **Example 2**, where the output includes the dominant value (`5`) and a distinct border value (`8`), we can apply a similar logic.\n\nThus, for the given test input grid, the output should include the dominant value (`3`) and the distinct border value (`8`).\n\nOutput:\n```\n3\n8\n```\n\n<answer>\n3\n8</answer>\n\nor simply in the required grid format if it matches the observed output structure:\n<answer>\n3 8</answer>\n\nHowever, based on the exact format of the outputs given in the examples, it seems more aligned with listing significant values. Therefore, the most straightforward interpretation based on the given examples, especially **Example 2**, would directly list the dominant and distinct values.\n\nThe final answer is <answer>3 8</answer>.",

Again, the output contains elements from the input.\n\nUpon closer inspection, let's consider a different approach. If we look at the corners and the structure of the grids:\n\n- **Example 1**: The output \"4 4 2\" could be related to the corners and the center or some pattern. The top-left, top-right, and bottom-left corners are \"2, 4, 4\" respectively. The middle element of the output is \"2\", which is the center element of the input grid.\n\n- **Example 2**: The output \"5, 8\" seems to be related to the most frequent elements or specific positions. \"5\" is the most frequent, and \"8\" is at the corners.\n\n- **Example 3**: The output grid contains \"8 0; 0 0; 0 0\". The top-left of the output is \"8\", which is the most frequent element in the input, and \"0\" is the next element that appears. The pattern in the output seems to be related to the frequency or the presence of elements in specific positions.\n\nLet's directly analyze the possibility that the output is related to the corners or the most frequent elements.\n\nFor **Example 1**:\n- Corners are (2, 4, 2, 4), and the center is 2.\n\nFor **Example 2**:\n- Corners are (8, 8, 5, 8), and the output is (5, 8), which are the most frequent and the corner/edge elements.\n\nFor **Example 3**:\n- Corners are (0, 0, 8, 8). The output seems to be related to the corners or the most frequent element \"8\".\n\nUpon a detailed examination, it appears the rule could be related to extracting specific elements or patterns from the input grid.\n\nLet's directly check if the rule is related to the corners or the central elements.\n\nFor the given test input:\n3 3 8\n3 3 3\n8 3 8\n\nThe corners are (3, 8, 3, 8). The most frequent element is \"3\".\n\nIf we consider the rule to be related to the corners or the most frequent element:\n- The most frequent element is \"3\".\n- Corners are (3, 8, 3, 8).\n\nLet's hypothesize the output could be related to the unique corner values or the most frequent element.\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n3 3 8\n3 3 3\n8 3 8\n\nIf we apply a rule similar to what might be inferred (though not directly clear from the examples), we can observe:\n- The most frequent element is \"3\".\n- Unique corner values are \"3\" and \"8\".\n\nA plausible output based on a simple rule could involve these values.\n\nLet's directly infer or guess the output based on observed patterns.\n\nThe output for the test input grid could be:\n3\n8\n\nSo, the output grid is:\n3\n8\n\n<answer>3 8</answer> is the solution if we were to follow a specific pattern.

Let's examine if the second column or a specific pattern within the grid is used.\n\nFor Example 1, the output is the first column: `0, 0, 0` paired with the second column's corresponding values: `0, 7, 7` (but the output is `1, 7, 1`), which doesn't directly match. However, looking closely, the output seems to be the first column and the value directly to the right of the first non-repeating or distinct value in the first column.\n\nUpon a detailed review:\n- The rule seems to involve the first column and another value from the grid.\n\n### Detailed Rule Analysis\n1. **First Column**: The first column of the output grid directly corresponds to the first column of the input grid.\n   \n2. **Second Column of Output**: The pattern isn't directly related to the second column of the input grid. Let's analyze further.\n\nUpon a more detailed analysis of the examples:\n- The output grid's second column seems to be related to the values in the input grid that are different from the first column's value or a pattern involving distinct values.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given test input grid and apply the observed pattern.\n\n### Test Input Grid Analysis\nInput Grid:\n```\n4 4 4 4 8 8 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 6 7 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n```\nFirst Column: `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4`\n\nThe first column of the output should be `4`.\n\nFor the second column, let's examine the pattern again with the understanding that the first column is `4`.\n\n### Applying the Rule\nIf we look closely at the examples again with the task in mind:\n- Example 1: First column is `0, 0, 0` and the second column in output is `1, 7, 1` which are the values in the second column of the input grid.\n- Example 2: First column is `2, 2, 1` (considering the change) and the second column is `1, 6, 2` which corresponds to the second column of the input grid.\n- Example 3 & 4: Similar pattern observed.\n\nThus, the rule seems to be: The output grid is formed by the first column and the second column of the input grid.\n\n### Generating Output for Test Input\nFirst Column: `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4`\nSecond Column: `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4`\n\nOutput Grid (first 3 rows, as the pattern in examples suggests the output grid's size is not directly proportional to the input grid's size but seems to be a fixed or smaller size):\n```\n4 4\n4 4\n4 4\n```\n\n<answer>\n4 4\n4 6\n4 4\n</answer>",

Let's verify this rule:\n\n1. **Example 1**: First column is `0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`. The output grid is the first three elements: `0, 0, 0` paired with the second column's first three elements `0, 7, 1`, resulting in `0 1`, `0 7`, `0 1`.\n2. **Example 2**: First column is `2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2`. The output grid takes the first three elements `2, 2, 2` and pairs them with the second column's elements `2, 1, 1` (though the actual second column is `2, 2, 2`), but upon closer inspection, it seems the rule might not be directly related to just the first column or it involves a different interpretation.\n3. **Example 3**: Doesn't directly follow the simple first column rule.\n4. **Example 4**: First column is `2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2`. The output grid is `2, 2, 2` paired with the second column's first three elements `2, 2, 2` but actually, it's `2 4`, `7 4`, `2 5`, indicating the output is related to the first and second columns.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears the rule involves taking elements from the first and second columns of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be formed by pairing elements from the first column with corresponding elements from the second column.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the examples with this rule in mind:\n\n- **Example 1**: First column `0, 0, 0` and second column `0, 7, 1`, resulting in `0 1`, `0 7`, `0 1`.\n- **Example 2**: First column `2, 2, 2` and second column `2, 2, 2`, but output is `2 1`, `1 6`, `1 2`. This doesn't directly match.\n- **Example 3**: Doesn't follow the simple pairing rule directly.\n- **Example 4**: First column `2, 2, 2` and second column `2, 2, 2`, output is `2 4`, `7 4`, `2 5`, which are actually the first column and the fourth column.\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n4 4 4 4 8 8 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 6 7 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n```\n\nLet's apply a potential rule based on observations. If we consider the pattern observed in **Example 4** where the output seems to be related to the first and fourth columns (`2 4`, `7 4`, `2 5`), we can try to apply a similar logic.\n\nFirst column: `4, 4, 4`\nFourth column: `4, 4, 4`\n\nThus, the output grid would be:\n```\n4 4\n4 4\n4 4\n```\n\n<answer>\n4 4\n4 4\n4 4\n</answer>\n\nHowever, my analysis was initially incorrect in identifying a consistent rule across all examples provided. Let's directly apply what seems to be a more consistent observation from the examples:\n\nThe output grid is formed by the elements of the first and a specific other column. The specific rule isn't directly clear from the initial analysis. \n\nFor the test input:\n```\n4 4 4 4 8 8 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 6 7 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n```\n\nIf we follow **Example 4**'s pattern where the output is related to the first and fourth columns:\n- First column: `4, 4, 4`\n- Fourth column: `4, 4, 4`\n\nSo, the output should be:\n```\n4 4\n4 4\n4 4\n```\n\n<answer>\n4 4\n4 4\n4 4\n</answer>",

Output is `0 1`, `0 7`, `0 1`. It seems the output is taking the first element and then the first different element it encounters (`1`), then the next element (`0`), and the next different element (`7`), and so on.\n\n2. **Example 2**: First column is `2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2`. Output is `2 1`, `1 6`, `1 2`. Here, the first element is `2`, and the different elements encountered are `1`, `6`.\n\n3. **Example 3**: First column is `6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6`. Output is `3 3 9` and `6 6 9`. The first different element from `6` is `3`, and another different element is `9`.\n\n4. **Example 4**: First column is `2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2`. Output is `2 4`, `7 4`, `2 5`. Here, the first element is `2`, and different elements encountered in the rows are `4`, `7`, `5`.\n\n### Rule Deduction\nThe rule seems to involve taking the first element of the first column and pairing it with the first different number it encounters in the corresponding row. Then, it continues with the next row, taking the first element and pairing it with a different number.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given test input grid.\n\n### Test Input Grid Analysis\nInput Grid:\n```\n4 4 4 4 8 8 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 6 7 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 2 2 2 2 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n```\nFirst column is `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4`.\n\n1. First row: `4` (first column), `8` (first different number) => `4 8`\n2. Second row: `4` (first column), `6` (first different number) => `4 6`\n3. Third row: `4` (first column), `4` is the same, so we look further, still `4`, so no different number is found easily, but following the pattern, it should be `4 4` if we consider the first element itself or the lack of a different number.\n4. Fourth row: Similarly, `4 4`.\n5. Fifth row: `4` (first column), `2` (first different number) => `4 2`\n6. Sixth row: `4` (first column), `2` (first different number) => `4 2`\n7. Seventh row: `4` (first column), `2` (first different number) => `4 2`\n8. Eighth row: `4` (first column), `2` (first different number) => `4 2`\n9. Ninth row: `4` (first column), `4` (same), so `4 4`.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n```\n4 8\n4 6\n4 4\n4 4\n4 2\n4 2\n4 2\n4 2\n4 4\n```\n<answer>\n4 8\n4 6\n4 4\n4 4\n4 2\n4 2\n4 2\n4 2\n4 4\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given examples and identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Examples\n\nLet's start by examining the provided examples to identify any patterns or rules.\n\n#### Example 1:\nInput and Output grids are given. Upon inspection, we notice that the output grid is similar to the input grid except for a specific sub-grid where the values are changed.\n\n#### Example 2, 3, and 4:\nSimilar patterns are observed in these examples as well. The output grids are largely similar to their respective input grids, with specific changes in certain sub-grids.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Pattern\n\nUpon closer inspection of all examples, it appears that the rule involves changing the values in a specific sub-grid. Let's analyze the changes:\n\n1. **Example 1**: The sub-grid with the value '8' is partially changed to '4' in the output.\n2. **Example 2**: The sub-grid with the value '3' is partially changed to '4'.\n3. **Example 3**: The sub-grid with the value '7' remains largely the same, but the sub-grid with '1' is surrounded by '4's where '7's were.\n4. **Example 4**: The sub-grid with '0' and '1's is partially changed to '4'.\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the Rule\n\nFrom the examples, it seems the rule involves identifying a specific sub-grid or pattern within the input grid and modifying it in a certain way to produce the output grid. Let's examine the changes more closely:\n\n- In all examples, the change occurs within a sub-grid that is surrounded by or adjacent to a different value.\n- The changed value is always '4', suggesting that '4' is a transformed value based on the context of the surrounding grid.\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the transformation in detail:\n\n1. **Identifying the Sub-Grid**: The transformation seems to occur in a sub-grid that is distinct from its surroundings.\n2. **Transformation Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it appears that the transformation involves changing certain elements within a sub-grid to '4', particularly where there's a transition or a specific pattern.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n3 3 3 3 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nLet's apply the observed rule:\n- The sub-grid with '3' is distinct and surrounded by '2's.\n- The transformation involves changing the '3's that are surrounded by other '3's and are not on the edge of the '3' sub-grid to '4'.\n\n### Step 6: Predicting the Output Grid\n\nApplying the rule to the test input grid:\n\n1. Identify the sub-grid with '3'.\n2. Change the inner '3's (not on the boundary with '2') to '4'.\n\nThe sub-grid with '3' is:\n```\n3 3 3 3\n3 2 2 3\n3 2 2 3\n3 2 2 3\n3 3 3 3\n```\n\nThe inner '3's that are adjacent to other '3's and not directly adjacent to '2's in a way that they're on the boundary are transformed.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nLet's directly provide the final output grid.\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n</answer>",

Change the inner '3's (not on the boundary with '2') to '4'.\n\nThe sub-grid with '3' is:\n```\n3 3 3 3\n3 2 2 3\n3 2 2 3\n3 2 2 3\n3 3 3 3\n```\n\nThe inner '3's that are adjacent to other '3's and not directly adjacent to '2's in a way that they're on the boundary are transformed.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nLet's directly provide the final output grid.\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n</answer>",

Notably, in all examples, certain regions of the grid are modified by changing their values to a specific number (4 in the given examples).\n\nLooking closely at the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: The region with '8' is partially changed to '4'.\n2. **Example 2**: The region with '3' and '5' is partially changed to '4'.\n3. **Example 3**: The region with '7' and '1' is partially changed to '4'.\n4. **Example 4**: The region with '0' and '1' is partially changed to '4'.\n\nThe common rule appears to involve changing specific inner areas of a different value to '4', while the rest of the grid remains the same.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nUpon a more detailed inspection, it seems that the transformation involves changing the value of certain cells to '4' based on their position relative to other values.\n\nFor instance, in **Example 2**, the cells that are surrounded by '3' on the left and have '5' or '3' around them are changed to '4'. More precisely, the rule seems to apply to cells that are adjacent to a different value on certain sides.\n\n### Rule Application to Test Input\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n3 3 3 3 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nLet's apply the observed rule. The value '3' is distinct from '2'. Looking at the grid, cells that are '2' and surrounded or adjacent to '3' in a certain configuration are potential candidates for change.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that cells with value '2' that are directly adjacent (right) to '3' and are within the '3' shaped region are changed to '4'.\n\n### Output Grid Generation\n\nApplying the rule to the test input grid:\n- The '2's that are adjacent to '3' on the right and fit within the pattern observed are changed to '4'.\n\nThus, the output grid will be:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n3 3 3 3 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nBecomes:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n</answer>\n```",

The change occurs for the cells that are 5 and are adjacent to 8 (horizontally or vertically).\n\n2. **Example 2**: Similar pattern is observed where the values change from 5 to 4 when they are adjacent to 3.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The change is from 7 to 4 when adjacent to 1.\n\n4. **Example 4**: The change is from 1 to 4 when adjacent to 0.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Rule\n\nThe rule appears to be that a cell's value changes to 4 if its original value is different from the distinct value(s) it is adjacent to (horizontally or vertically), and that distinct value is present in its neighborhood.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the input grid:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n3 3 3 3 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nLet's apply the rule:\n- Cells with value 2 that are adjacent to 3 will change to 4.\n- The rest remain the same.\n\n### Step 6: Predicting the Output Grid\n\n1. The cells in the 3rd row, 5th column (and surrounding) are analyzed. The value is 2 and is adjacent to 3, so it changes to 4.\n2. Similarly, other cells are analyzed.\n\nLet's directly apply this to the grid:\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n3 3 3 3 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2 3\n2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n```\n\nOutput Grid (predicted):\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 4 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 4 4 4 3\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 3 2\n2 2 2 2 4 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n3 3 3 3 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 3 4 4 3\n2 2 2 2 4 4 4 3\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Examples\n\nLet's analyze the given examples to identify any patterns or rules.\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input grid has a larger inner rectangle of 8s surrounded by 6s.\n   - Output grid retains the outer shape of the input grid but modifies the inner rectangle.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input grid contains various numbers in a specific pattern.\n   - Output grid shows a modification of the inner patterns.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Similar to Example 2, with different numbers.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Another instance with a different number.\n\n5. **Example 5:**\n   - Yet another instance with different numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Pattern\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can observe that in all examples, the output grid is derived from the input grid by modifying the inner part of the grid in a specific way. The border of the grid remains unchanged.\n\nLet's examine the transformation of the inner part more closely:\n\n- In **Example 1**, the inner 8s are mostly retained except for the inner part which becomes 6s, and the very center column of 8s becomes 6s except for the top and bottom which remain 8s.\n- In **Example 2**, the inner \"1\"s are modified such that only the top, bottom, and the middle column remain \"1\"s, and the rest become \"6\"s.\n- In **Example 3**, a similar pattern is observed where the inner \"9\"s are mostly retained on the border of the \"9\" rectangle and the center column of \"9\"s is modified.\n- In **Example 4**, the inner \"8\"s are retained on the border and the rest are modified.\n- In **Example 5**, the inner \"7\"s and \"8\"s follow a similar transformation.\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the Rule\n\nThe common rule appears to be that the outermost layer of the inner distinct rectangle (or pattern) is retained, and the inner part is either filled with the surrounding number or modified in a way that the center column (or sometimes row) is highlighted or modified.\n\nHowever, upon a detailed review, a simpler and more consistent rule can be observed:\n- The border of the grid remains the same.\n- For the inner distinct pattern or rectangle, the border of this pattern is retained, and the inner cells are modified.\n\nMore specifically, the rule seems to involve retaining the outer layer of any distinct inner pattern and changing the inner cells in a certain way, often making the center column or a specific pattern within the inner rectangle distinct.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe inner distinct patterns are \"9\"s and \"2\"s. The \"9\"s form a rectangle, and so do the \"2\"s. Applying the observed rule:\n- The border of \"9\"s is retained, and the inner \"9\"s are modified.\n- The border of \"2\"s is retained, and the inner \"2\"s are modified.\n\nLet's directly infer the output based on the pattern observed:\n- The \"9\"s rectangle's border is retained, and the inner cells become \"9\"s with the middle column being different (\"9\" becomes another value or retains, but based on examples, it seems the middle value changes).\n- The \"2\"s rectangle similarly has its border retained.\n\nThe output grid, based on the observed transformations in the examples, should be:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nHowever, the exact modification rule isn't directly clear from the given examples without assuming the pattern. Based on the closest match and simplification:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nLet's directly apply a simplified version of the rule that seems to fit most examples: the center column of the inner rectangles is modified.\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nHowever, the exact rule from the examples directly doesn't perfectly fit without making some assumptions. The provided answer is based on the closest observed pattern. \n\nGiven the exact format required for the output and re-evaluating the steps for a precise match:\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

Based on the closest match and simplification:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nLet's directly apply a simplified version of the rule that seems to fit most examples: the center column of the inner rectangles is modified.\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nHowever, the exact rule from the examples directly doesn't perfectly fit without making some assumptions. The provided answer is based on the closest observed pattern. \n\nGiven the exact format required for the output and re-evaluating the steps for a precise match:\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 9 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\nIn Example 1, the input grid is a 10x12 grid with a specific pattern of numbers (6, 8). The output grid maintains the outer structure similar to the input but alters the inner pattern. Specifically, the '8's in the input grid are transformed into a pattern where the '8's on the border of the '8' region remain '8', and the inner '8's are replaced with '6'.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Example 2\nExample 2 involves a different set of numbers and a larger grid. Here, the input grid has dimensions 12x13 with various numbers (6, 1, 0). The output grid again shows a transformation where the inner parts of distinct number regions are altered. Specifically, the '1's form a region, and the central '1' in the vertical direction is replaced with '6', except for the outermost '1's in that region.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Example 3\nIn Example 3, the grid is 12x11, and the numbers are different (5, 9, 0). The '9's and '0's form distinct regions. The '9's region has its inner '9's (except those on the border of the '9' region) replaced with '5', and similarly, the '0's region has its central element in the vertical direction replaced with '5' or remains '0' if on the border of its region.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Example 4\nExample 4 has a grid of size 11x12 with numbers (4, 8). The '8's are enclosed within '4's. The output shows that the '8's on the border remain '8', and the inner '8's are replaced with '4', except for the '8's on the edge of the '8' region.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing Example 5\nIn Example 5, the grid size is 12x13, and the numbers are (0, 8, 7). The '8's and '7's form distinct regions within '0's. The '8's region has its inner elements (not on the border) replaced, and the '7's region has its central '7's replaced with '0'.\n\n### Step 6: Identifying the Pattern\nUpon closer inspection, a pattern emerges: the elements within a distinct number region are modified such that the border elements of the region remain the same, and the inner elements are either replaced with the surrounding number or follow a specific alteration pattern.\n\n### Step 7: Detailed Pattern Analysis\nFor each distinct region of numbers:\n- The border elements of the region remain unchanged.\n- The inner elements are replaced, often with the number surrounding the region or a specific pattern.\n\n### Step 8: Applying the Pattern to the Test Input Grid\nThe test input grid is an 11x11 grid. There's a region of '9's and '2's within '0's. Following the observed pattern:\n- The '9's are surrounded by '0's and '2's. The '9's on the border of the '9' region remain '9', and the inner '9' is replaced with '0'.\n- The '2's are surrounded by '0's and '9's. The '2's on the border of the '2' region remain '2', and the inner '2's are replaced. Specifically, the central '2' in the vertical direction is replaced with '0'.\n\n### Step 9: Generating the Output Grid\nLet's apply this rule:\n- The '9's region is 3x3. The border '9's remain '9', and the inner '9' becomes '0'.\n- The '2's region is 4x4. The border '2's remain '2'. The inner '2's are replaced; the central ones in the vertical direction become '0'.\n\nThus, the output grid will be:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 0 9 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 0 9 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n</answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 0 9 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Example 1\n\nInput:\n```\n6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 6 6 6\n6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 6 6 6\n6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 6 6 6\n6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 6 6 6\n6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 6 6 6\n6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 6 6 6\n6 6 8 6 6 6 6 6 8 6 6 6\n6 6 8 6 6 6 6 6 8 6 6 6\n6 6 8 6 6 6 6 6 8 6 6 6\n6 6 8 6 6 6 6 6 8 6 6 6\n6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nThe output suggests that the inner part of the grid, specifically the area that is not on the border of the \"8\" region, is modified. The \"8\" region's inner values are changed to the value of the surrounding border of that region (which is \"6\"), except for the border of the \"8\" region itself, which remains \"8\".\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Example 2\n\nInput:\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 6 6\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 6 6\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 6 6\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 1 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 6 1 6 6\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 1 6 6\n6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 1 1 1 6 6\n6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nHere, we see a similar pattern where the inner values of distinct regions are modified. For the \"1\" region, the inner value becomes \"6\" (the surrounding value), except for the \"1\" on the border of the \"1\" region.\n\n### Step 3: Generalize the Rule\n\nFrom the examples, it appears that for any given distinct region (a group of cells with the same value that are connected), the cells that are not on the border of this region are changed to the value of the cells surrounding this region.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nInput:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThere are two distinct regions here: \"9\" and \"2\". \n\n1. For the \"9\" region, the surrounding value is \"0\". Thus, the inner \"9\"s should become \"0\", except for those on the border of the \"9\" region.\n2. For the \"2\" region, the surrounding value is also \"0\". Thus, the inner \"2\"s should become \"0\", except for those on the border of the \"2\" region.\n\nLet's apply this:\n\n- The \"9\" region's border is the outer \"9\"s. The inner \"9\" becomes \"0\".\n- The \"2\" region's border is the outer \"2\"s. The inner \"2\"s become \"0\".\n\nThus, the output should be:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 0 9 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 9 0 9 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

Specifically, the distinct value (0 in Example 1 and 3, 5 in Example 2) seems to be \"propagated\" or \"copied\" in a certain manner.\n\nRevisiting the examples with a focus on the distinct values:\n- **Example 1**: 0 is in the third row. In the output, the row above it (second row) has 0 propagated to the right.\n- **Example 2**: 5 is in the fifth row. The row above it (fourth row) has 5 in its column and to the left.\n- **Example 3**: 0 is in the third row. The row above it (second row) remains unchanged, but the third row in the output has 0 propagated to the left.\n\nThe actual rule seems to be related to how the first non-majority element in a column (from the bottom up) affects the output.\n\nLet's directly infer the rule from the given examples and apply it to the test input grid.\n\n### Rule Inference:\n1. Start from the bottom row and move upwards.\n2. For each column, find the first cell that has a value different from the majority of its row.\n3. Once found, propagate this value to all cells above it in that column in the output grid until you reach a row that has this value as its majority or until you hit a row where this rule doesn't apply directly due to another distinct value being present.\n\nHowever, a simpler and more consistent rule across the examples seems to be:\n- For the cell that has a distinct value (not matching the majority of its row), if it's not in the top row, its value is copied to the row above it, starting from its column and moving right (for the row above) or left (for its own row in some cases).\n\nLet's simplify and directly apply a plausible rule based on observations:\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -> This row is not present, so we consider up to the 9th row as per the given grid.\n\nCorrecting for the actual grid size (9x8):\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n\nLet's directly apply a simplified rule that seems plausible based on the distinct values and their propagation:\n- The '3' in the 7th row, first column, will affect the 6th row.\n- The '2' in the 8th row, 7th column, will affect the 7th row.\n\nApplying the observed pattern:\n1. '3' in the 7th row affects the 6th row.\n2. '2' in the 8th row affects the 7th row.\n\nOutput Grid:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n\nLet's directly format the output as per the required format.\n\n<answer>\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n</answer>\n\n<answer>1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1</answer>",

Other numbers remain largely in place, but there's a clear shift in the '0'.\n\n2. **Example 2**: The '5' in the fifth row, first column is propagated diagonally (down and to the right) in the output grid. The number '5' appears in the fourth row (one position to the right) and continues diagonally.\n\n3. **Example 3**: The '0' is propagated to the right in the third row of the output, filling the subsequent columns.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that the non-matching value (the value different from the majority in its row or column) in the input grid is being shifted or propagated in the output grid.\n\nFor **Example 1**, the '0' is in the third row; it propagates to the right in the row above it and continues its propagation in its own row.\n\nFor **Example 2**, the '5' is in the fifth row; it starts propagating diagonally (down and to the right) from its original column.\n\nFor **Example 3**, the '0' propagates to the right.\n\n### General Rule\n\nThe rule appears to be that the first non-matching value (different from the majority of its row or column) in a column from top to bottom is propagated either to the right or diagonally down to the right in the output grid.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given test input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input Grid\n\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n\nThe non-matching values are '3' in the seventh row, first column, and '2' in the ninth row, sixth column.\n\n1. The '3' is propagated diagonally down to the right.\n2. The '2' is also considered, but since it's not at the start of its row or column, its behavior is observed directly in the grid.\n\nLet's predict the output based on the observed rule.\n\nThe '3' will start propagating from the seventh row. So, it will be in the seventh row, first column, then eighth row, second column (if it existed), and so on.\n\nOutput Grid Calculation:\n1. '3' in the seventh row is propagated: It will appear in the seventh row, first column, and then diagonally down to the right. So, the eighth row, second column will have '3'.\n\nPerforming the propagation:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 3 1 1 1 2 1\n\nAnd for '2', it is not the first non-matching value in its column, so it doesn't propagate in the same manner.\n\nThe final output grid will be as calculated.\n\n<answer>\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 3 1 1 1 2 1\n</answer>\n\n<answer>\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 3 1 1 1 2 1\n</answer>",

The central element of the output grid is the central element of the inner sub-grid of the input that differs from the rest. The other elements of the output grid seem to be related to the values in the input grid.\n\nLet's examine the central element and the surrounding elements in each input grid and their corresponding outputs.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a distinct sub-grid around the element `7`. The output's central element is `2` (the value of the central element in the input's distinct sub-grid), and the rest are `7`s.\n2. **Example 2**: The distinct element is `8`, and the output's central element is `9` (the most common or background value in the sub-grid around `8` is `9`), and the rest are `8`s.\n3. **Example 3**: The distinct sub-grid is around `2`, with `9` being the background value. The output's central element is `9`, and the rest are `2`s.\n4. **Example 4**: The distinct element is `7`, and the output's central element is `5` (the background value around `7`), and the rest are `7`s.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Rule\nFrom the analysis, the rule seems to be:\n- The output grid is a 3x3 grid.\n- The central element of the output is the background or most common value in the sub-grid of the input that contains the distinct or different element.\n- The other elements of the output grid are the distinct or different element found in the input grid.\n\n### Step 7: Apply the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nInput:\n1 1 8 8 8 1\n1 1 8 7 8 1\n1 1 8 8 8 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nThe distinct sub-grid in the input is around `7`, with `8` being the background value in that sub-grid. Thus, the central element of the output should be `8`, and the rest should be `7`s.\n\nOutput:\n7 7 7\n7 8 7\n7 7 7\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7\n7 8 7\n7 7 7\n</answer>\n\n<answer>7 7 7\n7 8 7\n7 7 7</answer>",

The central element of the output grid is the central element of the inner sub-grid of the input that differs from the rest. The other elements of the output grid seem to be related to the values in the input grid.\n\nLet's examine the central element and the surrounding elements in each input grid and their corresponding outputs.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The input grid has a distinct sub-grid around the element `7`. The output's central element is `2` (the value of the central element in the input's distinct sub-grid), and the rest are `7`s.\n2. **Example 2**: The distinct element is `8`, and the output's central element is `9` (the most common or background value in the sub-grid around `8` is `9`), and the rest are `8`s.\n3. **Example 3**: The distinct sub-grid is around `2`, with `9` being the background value. The output's central element is `9`, and the rest are `2`s.\n4. **Example 4**: The distinct element is `7`, and the output's central element is `5` (the background value around `7`), and the rest are `7`s.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Rule\nFrom the analysis, the rule seems to be:\n- The output grid is a 3x3 grid.\n- The central element of the output is the background or most common value in the sub-grid of the input that contains the distinct or different element.\n- The other elements of the output grid are the distinct or different element found in the input grid.\n\n### Step 7: Apply the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nInput:\n1 1 8 8 8 1\n1 1 8 7 8 1\n1 1 8 8 8 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nThe distinct sub-grid in the input is around `7`, with `8` being the background value in that sub-grid.

The output grid seems to be related to the input grid in a specific way. Let's examine the relationship between the input and output grids more closely.\n\n1. **Size of the Output Grid**: The size of the output grid is 3x3 in all examples. This suggests that the output grid is not directly proportional to the size of the input grid but is fixed at 3x3.\n\n2. **Central Element and Surroundings**: Looking at the input grids and their corresponding output grids, it appears that the central element of the output grid is related to the central element of a 3x3 sub-grid in the input grid.\n\n3. **Pattern Observation**:\n   - In Example 1, the central element of the 3x3 sub-grid centered around the element '7' is '7', and the output grid's central element is '2' (the value of the surrounding elements in the input grid is '2'). The rest of the output grid is '7', which is the distinct element in the 3x3 sub-grid.\n   - In Example 2, the central element '8' is surrounded by '9's, and the output's central element is '9'. The rest of the output grid is '8', which is the central element of the input's 3x3 sub-grid.\n   - In Example 3, the central element '2' is surrounded by '9's, and the output's central element is '9'. The rest of the output grid is '2', the central element.\n   - In Example 4, the central element '7' is surrounded by '5's, and the output's central element is '5'. The rest of the output grid is '7'.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that:\n- The central element of the output grid is the most frequent element in the 3x3 neighborhood of the central element in the input grid (or simply related to the central element and its surroundings).\n- The rest of the elements in the output grid are filled with the central element of the 3x3 sub-grid in the input.\n\nLet's refine this observation:\n- The output grid's central element is actually the element that is different from the central element in the 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid. If the central element is different from its neighbors, it becomes the value for the rest of the output grid, and the central output is the value of the neighbors.\n\nHowever, a simpler rule can be derived:\n- The output grid is a 3x3 grid where the central cell is the value of the central cell in a 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid centered around the most distinct or different element. The rest of the cells are filled with the most distinct element in that 3x3 sub-grid.\n\nLet's directly analyze the given test input grid:\nInput:\n1 1 8 8 8 1\n1 1 8 7 8 1\n1 1 8 8 8 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nThe 3x3 sub-grid centered around '7' is:\n1 8 7\n1 8 8\n1 8 8\n\nHere, '7' is the distinct element. So, according to the observed pattern, the output grid should be filled with '7' except for the central element, which should be '8' (the surrounding element).\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n7 7 7\n7 8 7\n7 7 7\n\n<answer>\n7 7 7\n7 8 7\n7 7 7\n</answer>\n\n<answer>7 7 7\n7 8 7\n7 7 7</answer>",

The central element of the output grid corresponds to the central element of a subset of the input grid, and the other elements of the output grid seem to be determined by the values in the input grid.\n\nLet's consider the central cell and its neighbors in the input grid and how they relate to the output grid.\n\n1. In Example 1, the input grid is 8x8, and the central part around the distinct element '7' is:\n   2 7 2\n   7 2 is not present, but if we consider a 3x3 sub-grid around '7', it's:\n   1 1 2 7 2 1 1\n   1 1 2 2 2 1 1\n   The output is '7' at the center and '2' elsewhere in its 3x3 grid, but actually, it's the opposite: the center of the output is '2', and '7' is elsewhere.\n\n2. Upon closer inspection, we can see that the output grid is generated based on a 3x3 sub-grid centered around the middle element of the input grid.\n\nThe rule appears to be that the output grid takes the value of the central cell of the input grid as the center of the output grid and the value that is different from the majority or background value around it as the rest of the output grid.\n\nHowever, a simpler and more consistent rule across all examples is that the center of the output grid is the value of the central cell of the 3x3 sub-grid around the distinct or notable element in the input grid, and the rest of the output grid is filled with the value of that distinct or notable element.\n\nLet's directly check the relation:\n- In Example 1, the distinct element is '7', and the center of the input grid around '7' is '2'. The output is:\n  7 7 7\n  7 2 7\n  7 7 7\n\n- In Example 2, '8' is the distinct element around '9', and '9' is the center. The output is:\n  8 8 8\n  8 9 8\n  8 8 8\n\n- In Example 3, '2' is the distinct element, and '9' is the center. The output is:\n  2 2 2\n  2 9 2\n  2 2 2\n\n- In Example 4, '7' is the distinct element, and '5' is the center. The output is:\n  7 7 7\n  7 5 7\n  7 7 7\n\nThe pattern suggests that the output grid is a 3x3 representation where the center is the central value of a notable sub-grid in the input, and the surrounding values are the notable or distinct value from that sub-grid.\n\n### Step 6: Apply the Rule to the Test Input Grid\nGiven the input grid:\n1 1 8 8 8 1\n1 1 8 7 8 1\n1 1 8 8 8 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nThe distinct element in the central part is '7'. The center of the 3x3 sub-grid around '7' is '7', and the surrounding value is '8'. So, the output should be '8' around and '7' at the center.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n8 8 8\n8 7 8\n8 8 8\n\n<answer>\n8 8 8\n8 7 8\n8 8 8\n</answer>\n\n<answer>8 8 8\n8 7 8\n8 8 8</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given examples to identify a pattern or rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\nIn the first example, the input grid is a 13x14 grid, and the output grid is also a 13x14 grid. Upon closer inspection, we can see that the output grid is derived from the input grid by taking a specific pattern from the input.\n\n### Pattern Identification\nLet's examine the structure of the input and output grids more closely across all examples.\n\n1. **Example 1**: The output seems to be a simplified or transformed version of the input. Specifically, the output grid appears to be focusing on the pattern created by certain numbers in the input grid.\n\n2. **Common Observations**:\n   - The output grids in all examples seem to retain certain patterns or values from the input grids.\n   - The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple arithmetic operations on the input values.\n\nUpon a detailed comparison:\n- **Example 1**: The output grid directly corresponds to a specific sub-pattern within the input grid, particularly focusing on the values 1, 7, and 0, which are repeated in a pattern.\n- **Example 2**: The output retains the outer structure and certain inner patterns of the input grid.\n- **Example 3**: The output grid is identical to the input grid.\n- **Example 4**: Similar to Example 2, the output grid retains certain patterns from the input grid.\n\n### Rule Deduction\nAfter analyzing the examples, it appears that the rule might not be a simple transformation but rather a selection or filtering of certain patterns or values from the input grid.\n\n1. **Pattern Retention**: The output grids seem to retain certain patterns or values from the input grids.\n2. **Identity Mapping for Certain Inputs**: In Example 3, the input grid is directly mapped to the output grid without any change.\n\nLet's directly compare the inputs and outputs:\n- The outputs seem to directly copy or slightly modify the input patterns.\n- Specifically, for Examples 1, 2, and 4, the outputs seem to ignore or modify certain parts of the input grids to create a simpler or more repetitive pattern.\n\n### Key Insight\nUpon closer inspection, we can observe that:\n- The rule seems to involve retaining or transforming specific patterns from the input grid.\n- For grids with certain repetitive or symmetric patterns, the output grid tends to simplify or retain these patterns.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nLet's analyze the test input grid:\n```\n6 3 0 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n3 2 0 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe test input grid has a mix of patterns. Notably, the grid has repetitive patterns in certain sections.\n\n### Output Grid Generation\nUpon analyzing the given examples again with a focus on pattern retention and the structure of the grids:\n- The outputs for Examples 1, 2, and 4 suggest that the rule involves retaining or simplifying certain patterns present in the input grids.\n\nGiven the repetitive nature of the patterns in the test input grid, particularly the repeating sequences in the lower part of the grid, it seems plausible that the output grid will retain or simplify these patterns.\n\nThe test input grid has a clear repetitive pattern in the lower sections, similar to the patterns observed in the examples. Specifically, the rows starting with \"6 3 0\" and \"3 2 0\" and \"0 0 0\" are repeated.\n\nGiven this observation and comparing with the examples provided, the output grid is likely to be:\n```\n6 3 0 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n3 2 0 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n<answer>\n6 3 0 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n3 2 0 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nThis output is based on the observation that the rule tends to retain or simplify the input patterns, and in the case of the test input, the pattern is retained as is, similar to Example 3.",

Upon closer inspection, we can see that the output grid is derived from the input grid by taking certain parts or patterns from the input.\n\n### Pattern Identification\nLet's examine the structure of the input and output grids more closely:\n- The output grid seems to ignore the first few rows and columns of the input grid and focuses on a repeating pattern within the input grid.\n\n### Detailed Analysis of Examples\n1. **Example 1**: The output grid seems to be a subset or a transformation of the input grid, focusing on the pattern involving the numbers 1, 7, and 0.\n2. **Example 2**: Here, the grid is 10x11, and the output grid maintains a similar pattern, focusing on the inner structure of the input grid.\n3. **Example 3**: The input is a 12x14 grid, and the output grid again follows a similar pattern, maintaining the structure related to the numbers in the input grid.\n4. **Example 4**: The grid is 10x11, and the output grid is derived by maintaining a certain pattern from the input grid.\n\n### Common Rule Identification\nUpon analyzing the examples, it appears that the output grid is derived by focusing on a specific pattern or subset of the input grid.

Specifically, for all examples given, the output grid seems to be a direct extraction or a simple transformation of the input grid's inherent pattern.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nGiven the test input grid:\n```\n6 3 0 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n3 2 0 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nTo predict the output grid, we need to identify the pattern or rule applied to the input grids in the examples.\n\n### Pattern in Examples\nUpon re-examination, it's clear that the output grids are directly related to the repeating or significant patterns within the input grids.\n\n### Direct Application\nFor the given test input, the pattern that emerges in the output grid is directly related to the inherent structure of the input grid.\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n```\n6 3 0 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n3 2 0 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n<answer>\n6 3 0 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n3 2 0 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n6 3 0 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n3 2 0 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 6 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n9 9 9 3 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3 0\n3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given examples and identify a common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing Example 1\nIn Example 1, the input grid is a 10x5 grid with a specific pattern, and the output grid is also a 10x5 grid. Upon closer inspection, we see that the output grid has the same values as the input grid for the top 4 rows, and the rest are zeros. The input grid has a distinct value (8) in the third row, fifth column, but this distinct value is not present in the output grid; instead, it is replaced by 4, which is the same as the surrounding values. However, looking closely, the output grid simply retains the top 4 rows as they are and zeros out the rest.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Example 2\nIn Example 2, the input is a 5x7 grid, and the output is a 5x5 grid. Here, it seems the output grid retains the first 5 columns of the input grid. The number of rows in the output is equal to the number of rows in the input.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Example 3\nIn Example 3, the input grid is an 11x7 grid, and the output grid is also an 11x7 grid but with a change. Upon closer inspection, we see that the bottom 4 rows (rows 8 to 11) remain unchanged, and the rows above them retain their original values as well. It seems that the rule might not be directly related to the number of rows or columns but rather to the pattern or values within.\n\n### Step 4: Re-evaluating the Examples\nLet's re-evaluate the examples to identify a pattern:\n- In Example 1, the top 4 rows are retained, and the rest are zeroed out.\n- In Example 2, it seems the output has the same number of rows as the input and retains the first 5 columns.\n- In Example 3, the last few rows (corresponding to the value '1' and '2') are retained as is, and so are the rows above them.\n\n### Step 5: Identifying the Pattern\nUpon a closer look:\n- Example 1 retains the top part and zeros out the rest.\n- Example 2 retains all rows but truncates columns to match the number of rows in the input.\n- Example 3 retains all rows and columns as is.\n\nLet's analyze further:\n- The output grid in Example 1 has the same values as the input for the top 4 rows. The number 4 is the minimum between the number of rows (10) and columns (5).\n- In Example 2, the output retains the first 5 columns, which is the number of rows (5) in the input grid.\n- In Example 3, the input grid has 11 rows, and the output grid retains the first 7 columns, which is the number of columns (7) in the input grid.\n\n### Step 6: Formulating the Rule\nThe rule appears to be that the output grid retains the minimum of the number of rows and columns of the input grid. If the number of rows is less than or equal to the number of columns, it retains all rows and truncates the columns to the number of rows. If the number of columns is less than the number of rows, it retains all columns and truncates the rows to the number of columns.\n\n### Step 7: Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nThe test input grid is an 8x7 grid. The number of rows (8) is greater than the number of columns (7). According to the rule, we should retain all columns and truncate the rows to the number of columns, which is 7.\n\nThus, we will retain the top 7 rows of the input grid.\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 1\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 2 8 8 7 7\n8 8 5 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n\nOutput (retaining top 7 rows):\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 1\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 2 8 8 7 7\n8 8 5 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 1\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 2 8 8 7 7\n8 8 5 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n</answer>\n<answer>8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 1\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 2 8 8 7 7\n8 8 5 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To determine the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples.\n\n### Example 1 Analysis\nInput Grid:\n```\n4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 8 4\n4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n9 0 0 0 0\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```\n4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\nThe output grid takes the top 4 rows of the input grid as is and fills the rest with zeros, effectively truncating the grid to the top 4 rows.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis\nInput Grid:\n```\n7 7 7 7 2 2 2\n7 7 4 7 2 2 2\n7 7 2 7 2 2 2\n7 7 7 7 7 2 2\n7 7 7 7 2 2 2\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```\n7 7 7 7 2 2 2\n7 7 7 7 2 2 2\n7 7 7 7 2 2 2\n7 7 7 7 2 2 2\n7 7 7 7 2 2 2\n```\nHere, the output grid is the input grid truncated to the top 5 rows.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis\nInput Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 6 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\nThe output grid is the same as the input grid because it has 10 rows, and the rule isn't immediately clear from just the number of rows. However, upon closer inspection, it seems the grid is not truncated.\n\n### Example 4 Analysis\nInput Grid:\n```\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 2 9 9\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 3 9 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 2 8 8 8 8 8\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n```\nThe output grid is truncated to the top 7 rows.\n\n### Common Rule Identification\nUpon analyzing the examples, it appears that the output grid is a truncated version of the input grid, with the number of rows in the output grid being equal to the number of rows in the input grid that have the same value in the first column.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the examples based on this observation:\n- Example 1: The first column has the value 4 repeated 4 times, then 0, and then other values. The output grid has 4 rows.\n- Example 2: The first column has the value 7 repeated 5 times. The output grid has 5 rows.\n- Example 3: The first column has the value 0 repeated 4 times, then 2 repeated 3 times, and then 1 repeated 3 times. If we count the consecutive repetitions starting from the top, it's 0 (4 times), 2 (3 times), and 1 (3 times). The rule doesn't directly apply as the output isn't truncated. However, upon closer inspection, we see the grid isn't truncated because the count of the first element (0) is 4, and there are 10 rows in total. The rule might be related to the count of consecutive identical values in the first column.\n- Example 4: The first column has 9 repeated 3 times, then 8 repeated 4 times. So, the count of the first element (9) is 3. The output grid has 7 rows, which is the total number of rows.\n\nHowever, a simpler rule can be derived by directly observing the pattern:\n- The number of rows in the output is equal to the maximum number of consecutive identical elements in the first column.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given test input grid.\n\n### Test Input Grid Analysis\nInput Grid:\n```\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 1\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 2 8 8 7 7\n8 8 5 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n```\nThe first column is: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8. There are 7 consecutive 8s.\n\nThus, according to the identified rule, the output grid should have 7 rows.\n\n### Output Grid Generation\nThe output grid will be the top 7 rows of the input grid.\n\n```\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 1\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 2 8 8 7 7\n8 8 5 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 1\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n8 8 2 8 8 7 7\n8 8 5 8 8 7 7\n8 8 8 8 8 7 7\n</answer>",
