Then, $17 / 16 = 1$ remainder $1$. Lastly, $1 / 16 = 0$ remainder $1$.

The given binary number is 100010010.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the binary number to decimal to better understand its value in base 10.\nTo convert 100010010 from binary to decimal, we calculate it as follows: $1*2^8 + 0*2^7 + 0*2^6 + 0*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 256 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 274$.\n\n## Step 3: Convert the decimal number to hexadecimal.\nNow, we need to convert 274 from decimal to hexadecimal.

Now, the quotient is 1, which is less than 16, so we stop.\n\n## Step 5: Write down the hexadecimal number using the quotients and remainders.\nThe remainders and the last quotient are used to form the hexadecimal number. So, we have 1 (quotient) as the most significant digit, 1 (remainder from the second division) as the next digit, and 2 (remainder from the first division) as the least significant digit. Thus, the hexadecimal representation is 112.\n\n## Step 6: Ensure the conversion is correct and follows the given rules for digits above 9.\nSince the hexadecimal number is 112, and it only contains digits less than 10, no conversion to letters is needed.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>112</answer>",

The given number in base-5 is 332.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the base-5 number 332 to decimal (base-10) to better understand its value in a familiar base.\nTo convert 332 from base-5 to base-10, we use the formula: $a_n \\times 5^n + a_{n-1} \\times 5^{n-1} + ... + a_0 \\times 5^0$. Here, $a_2 = 3$, $a_1 = 3$, and $a_0 = 2$. So, the calculation is: $3 \\times 5^2 + 3 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0$.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the base-5 to base-10 conversion calculation.\n$3 \\times 5^2 = 3 \\times 25 = 75$, $3 \\times 5^1 = 3 \\times 5 = 15$, and $2 \\times 5^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2$. Adding these together: $75 + 15 + 2 = 92$. So, the base-10 equivalent of 332 in base-5 is 92.\n\n## Step 4: Convert the decimal number 92 to base-4.\nTo convert 92 to base-4, we divide 92 by 4 and keep track of the remainder. We continue this process with the quotient until the quotient is 0.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the base-10 to base-4 conversion.\nFirst division: $92 \\div 4 = 23$ remainder 0.\nSecond division: $23 \\div 4 = 5$ remainder 3.\nThird division: $5 \\div 4 = 1$ remainder 1.\nFourth division: $1 \\div 4 = 0$ remainder 1.\n\n## Step 6: Write down the base-4 number by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\nThe remainders from the last to the first division are 1, 1, 3, 0. So, the base-4 representation is 1130.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>1130</answer>",

The quotient 14 represents the next higher digit in hexadecimal. In hexadecimal, 14 is represented as 'e' (since it's greater than 9, we use letters).\n\n## Step 6: Write down the hexadecimal number\nThe remainder is 5, and the quotient is 14, which is 'e' in hexadecimal. So, the hexadecimal representation is 'e5'.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>e5</answer>",

So, \"a8\" in base-14 is calculated as (10 * 14^1) + (8 * 14^0).\n\n## Step 3: Perform the base-14 to base-10 conversion calculation.\nThe calculation is: (10 * 14) + (8 * 1) = 140 + 8 = 148.\n\n## Step 4: Convert the base-10 number to base-9.\nNow, we need to convert 148 (base-10) to base-9. This involves dividing 148 by 9 and noting the remainder. We continue this process with the quotient until the quotient becomes 0.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the base-10 to base-9 conversion.\nFirst division: 148 / 9 = 16 remainder 4.\nSecond division: 16 / 9 = 1 remainder 7.\nThird division: 1 / 9 = 0 remainder 1.\n\n## Step 6: Write down the base-9 number.\nThe remainders from the last to the first division give the base-9 representation: 174.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>174</answer>",

So, \\(10 \\times 14 + 8 \\times 1 = 140 + 8 = 148\\).\n\n## Step 3: Convert the decimal number 148 to base-9.\nTo convert 148 to base-9, we divide 148 by 9 and note the quotient and remainder. We continue this process with the quotient until it is less than 9.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the division of 148 by 9.\n\\(148 \\div 9 = 16\\) remainder 4.

This remainder is another part of our base-9 number.\n\n## Step 6: Continue the division process with the quotient 1.\n\\(1 \\div 9 = 0\\) remainder 1. Since the quotient is now 0, we stop. This remainder is the most significant digit of our base-9 number.\n\n## Step 7: Write down the base-9 number.\nThe base-9 equivalent of 148 is \\(171_9\\), combining the remainders from the last to the first division step.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>171</answer>",
