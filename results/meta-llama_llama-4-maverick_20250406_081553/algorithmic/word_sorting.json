ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character-encoding scheme that assigns unique codes to characters, including letters, digits, and control characters. Unicode is an extension of ASCII that includes a much wider range of characters from various languages. When we sort words using ASCII/Unicode ordering, we are essentially comparing the sequence of ASCII/Unicode values of the characters in each word.\n\nGiven the words: hygiene, sleep, serves, attached\n\n1. First, we convert each word into its ASCII/Unicode representation and compare them character by character from left to right.\n\nThe words are:\n- hygiene\n- sleep\n- serves\n- attached\n\nLet's examine their ASCII/Unicode ordering by comparing them directly:\n- attached\n- hygiene\n- serves\n- sleep\n\nIn ascending order, the correct sequence is: attached, hygiene, serves, sleep\n\nTo get the descending order, we reverse this sequence:\n- sleep\n- serves\n- hygiene\n- attached\n\nSo, the comma-separated list in descending order is: sleep, serves, hygiene, attached\n\n<answer>sleep, serves, hygiene, attached</answer>",

In the context of this problem, we're dealing with English characters, so ASCII is relevant.\n\nThe given words are: territory, tried, house, conceived, cities\n\n1. First, let's list the words and their ASCII/Unicode ordering:\n   - conceived\n   - cities\n   - house\n   - territory\n   - tried\n\n2. To sort them in descending order, we compare the ASCII values of the characters from left to right:\n   - cities\n   - conceived\n   - house\n   - territory\n   - tried\n\nLet's sort them:\n1. conceived starts with 'c' (ASCII: 99)\n2. cities starts with 'c' (ASCII: 99)\n3. house starts with 'h' (ASCII: 104)\n4. territory starts with 't' (ASCII: 116)\n5. tried starts with 't' (ASCII: 116)\n\nIn ascending order, they would be: cities, conceived, house, territory, tried\n\nIn descending order, they become: tried, territory, house, conceived, cities\n\nSo, the sorted list in descending order is: tried, territory, house, conceived, cities\n\nThe final answer is:\n<answer>tried,territory,house,conceived,cities</answer>",

The first step is to understand ASCII/Unicode ordering. ASCII/Unicode ordering refers to the order in which characters are arranged according to their ASCII or Unicode values. For English letters, this generally follows alphabetical order, with uppercase letters coming before lowercase letters.\n\n2. The given list of words is: territory, tried, house, conceived, cities.\n\n3. To sort these words in descending order, we first need to sort them in ascending order and then reverse the order.\n\n   - In ascending order (ASCII/Unicode), the list is: cities, conceived, house, territory, tried.\n   - Reversing this order gives the descending order.\n\n4. Let's sort the given words:\n   - cities\n   - conceived\n   - house\n   - territory\n   - tried\n\n   In descending order, this becomes:\n   - tried\n   - territory\n   - house\n   - conceived\n   - cities\n\n5.
