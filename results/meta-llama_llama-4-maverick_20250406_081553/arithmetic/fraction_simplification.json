Let's start by checking if both numbers are divisible by the smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, etc.) and proceed from there.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD\nFirst, let's check divisibility by small primes. Both numbers are even, so they are divisible by 2.\n\n## Step 3: Continue the Euclidean algorithm\n4108 = 2 * 2054 and 47320 = 2 * 23660.

Let's begin with 2992 and 8960.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 2992 into its prime factors.\n2992 can be divided by 2 (its smallest prime factor), giving 2992 = 2 * 1496. Continuing, 1496 = 2 * 748, 748 = 2 * 374, 374 = 2 * 187. Since 187 is 11 * 17, we have 2992 = 2^4 * 11 * 17.\n\n## Step 4: Factorize 8960 into its prime factors.\n8960 can be divided by 2, giving 8960 = 2 * 4480. Continuing this process: 4480 = 2 * 2240, 2240 = 2 * 1120, 1120 = 2 * 560, 560 = 2 * 280, 280 = 2 * 140, 140 = 2 * 70, 70 = 2 * 35, and 35 = 5 * 7. So, 8960 = 2^7 * 5 * 7.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the common prime factors between 2992 and 8960.\nFrom step 3 and step 4, we have 2992 = 2^4 * 11 * 17 and 8960 = 2^7 * 5 * 7.
