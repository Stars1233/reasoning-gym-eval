          "full_model_response": "To find the GCD of 496 and 676, we first need to factorize each number into its prime factors.\n\n## Step 1: Factorize 496 into its prime factors.\nFirst, let's break down 496. We start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, 2. 496 \u00f7 2 = 248, 248 \u00f7 2 = 124, 124 \u00f7 2 = 62, 62 \u00f7 2 = 31. So, 496 = 2^4 * 31.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize 676 into its prime factors.\nNow, let's break down 676. Similarly, 676 \u00f7 2 = 338, 338 \u00f7 2 = 169. Since 169 is not divisible by 2, we move to the next prime number. 169 \u00f7 13 = 13. So, 676 = 2^2 * 13^2.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the common prime factors between 496 and 676.\nFrom Step 1 and Step 2, we have 496 = 2^4 * 31 and 676 = 2^2 * 13^2. The common prime factor is 2.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the power of the common prime factor to be included in the GCD.\nThe power of 2 in 496 is 4, and in 676 is 2. The minimum power of 2 between the two numbers is 2.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the GCD.\nGCD = 2^2 = 4.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>4</answer>",
