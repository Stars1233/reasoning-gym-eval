The numbers are: 84610222.238000, 84,610,225.24900001, and 8.461022142800000e+07. We need to compare these numbers to find the largest one.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the numbers to a comparable format\nTo compare these numbers, it's helpful to have them in the same format. The first number is already in standard decimal format. The second number is also in decimal format but with commas; removing the commas gives 84610225.24900001. The third number is in scientific notation and needs to be converted to decimal format for comparison.\n\n## Step 3: Convert the third number from scientific notation to decimal\nThe third number is 8.461022142800000e+07. To convert it to decimal, we move the decimal point 7 places to the right because \"e+07\" indicates that the number should be multiplied by 10^7. So, 8.461022142800000e+07 = 84610221.42800000.\n\n## Step 4: Compare the numbers\nNow, we compare the three numbers: 84610222.238000, 84610225.24900001, and 84610221.42800000. To find the largest, we look at the numbers from left to right.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the largest number\n- The first number is 84610222.238000.\n- The second number is 84610225.24900001.\n- The third number is 84610221.42800000.\nComparing them:\n- All numbers start with \"846102\", so we look at the next digits.\n- The third number has \"21\" after \"846102\", the first number has \"22\", and the second number has \"25\". Since 25 is greater than 22, and 22 is greater than 21, the second number is the largest.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>84610225.24900001</answer>",

The notation \"e+08\" means the number should be multiplied by 10^8. So, 5.906106242520000e+08 = 5.906106242520000 * 10^8 = 590610624.252.\n\nNow, we compare the two numbers:\n1. 590610624.252\n2. 590610633.602000\n\nIt's clear that 590610624.252 is less than 590610633.602000.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is 5.906106242520000e+08.\n\n<answer>5.906106242520000e+08</answer>",
