Since 395\u00b0 is greater than 180\u00b0, this can't be an interior angle of a convex polygon.\n\nLet me recalculate. The formula for the sum of interior angles is (n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0.\nFor a 6-sided polygon: (6-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 4 \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\n\nSum of the first five angles: 127\u00b0 + 32\u00b0 + 42\u00b0 + 106\u00b0 + 18\u00b0 = 325\u00b0\n\nThe sixth angle: 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0\n\nThis is still the same result. Let me double-check if I made a mistake in my understanding or calculation.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider what a convex polygon is. In a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180\u00b0. The sum of all interior angles is still (n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0.\n\nLet me verify my calculation once more:\nSum of interior angles for a 6-sided polygon = (6-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\nSum of the first five angles = 127\u00b0 + 32\u00b0 + 42\u00b0 + 106\u00b0 + 18\u00b0 = 325\u00b0\nSixth angle = 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0\n\nI see the issue now. This result contradicts the definition of a convex polygon. Let me check if I misunderstood the problem or made a calculation error.\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood what the problem is asking for. Let me reconsider.\n\nThe sum of interior angles of a 6-sided polygon is 720\u00b0.\nThe first five angles sum to 325\u00b0.\nSo the sixth angle must be 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0.\n\nBut this can't be right for a convex polygon. Let me check if the problem might be referring to something else.\n\nActually, I think I need to be more careful about the definition of interior angles in a polygon. The interior angle at each vertex is the angle inside the polygon.\n\nFor a 6-sided convex polygon, the sum of interior angles is (6-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0.\nGiven five angles: 127\u00b0 + 32\u00b0 + 42\u00b0 + 106\u00b0 + 18\u00b0 = 325\u00b0\nThe sixth angle must be: 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0\n\nThis is still greater than 180\u00b0, which contradicts the convex property.\n\nLet me recheck my arithmetic:\n127 + 32 + 42 + 106 + 18 = 127 + 32 + 42 + 124 = 127 + 32 + 166 = 127 + 198 = 325\n\nSo the sum of the first five angles is indeed 325\u00b0.\n\nAnd 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0.\n\nI think there might be an error in the problem statement or my understanding of it. Let me try one more approach.\n\nActually, let's verify if the given angles could be exterior angles instead of interior angles.\n\nFor exterior angles, their sum is always 360\u00b0 for any polygon.\nIf these were exterior angles, then the sixth exterior angle would be:\n360\u00b0 - (127\u00b0 + 32\u00b0 + 42\u00b0 + 106\u00b0 + 18\u00b0) = 360\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 35\u00b0\n\nAnd the corresponding interior angle would be 180\u00b0 - 35\u00b0 = 145\u00b0.\n\nBut the problem specifically mentions interior angles, so this approach doesn't apply.\n\nLet me recalculate once more:\nSum of interior angles for a 6-sided polygon = (6-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\nSum of the first five angles = 127\u00b0 + 32\u00b0 + 42\u00b0 + 106\u00b0 + 18\u00b0 = 325\u00b0\nSixth angle = 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0\n\nI believe the answer is 395\u00b0, though this seems unusual for a convex polygon.\n\n<answer>395</answer>",

Let me double-check if I made a mistake in my understanding or calculation.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider what a convex polygon is. In a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180\u00b0. The sum of all interior angles is still (n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0.\n\nLet me verify my calculation once more:\nSum of interior angles for a 6-sided polygon = (6-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\nSum of the first five angles = 127\u00b0 + 32\u00b0 + 42\u00b0 + 106\u00b0 + 18\u00b0 = 325\u00b0\nSixth angle = 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0\n\nI see the issue now. This result contradicts the definition of a convex polygon. Let me check if I misunderstood the problem or made a calculation error.\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood what the problem is asking for. Let me reconsider.\n\nThe sum of interior angles of a 6-sided polygon is 720\u00b0.\nThe first five angles sum to 325\u00b0.\nSo the sixth angle must be 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0.\n\nBut this can't be right for a convex polygon. Let me check if the problem might be referring to something else.\n\nActually, I think I need to be more careful about the definition of interior angles in a polygon. The interior angle at each vertex is the angle inside the polygon.\n\nFor a 6-sided convex polygon, the sum of interior angles is (6-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0.\nGiven five angles: 127\u00b0 + 32\u00b0 + 42\u00b0 + 106\u00b0 + 18\u00b0 = 325\u00b0\nThe sixth angle must be: 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0\n\nThis is still greater than 180\u00b0, which contradicts the convex property.\n\nLet me recheck my arithmetic:\n127 + 32 + 42 + 106 + 18 = 127 + 32 + 42 + 124 = 127 + 32 + 166 = 127 + 198 = 325\n\nSo the sum of the first five angles is indeed 325\u00b0.\n\nAnd 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0.\n\nI think there might be an error in the problem statement or my understanding of it. Let me try one more approach.\n\nActually, let's verify if the given angles could be exterior angles instead of interior angles.\n\nFor exterior angles, their sum is always 360\u00b0 for any polygon.\nIf these were exterior angles, then the sixth exterior angle would be:\n360\u00b0 - (127\u00b0 + 32\u00b0 + 42\u00b0 + 106\u00b0 + 18\u00b0) = 360\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 35\u00b0\n\nAnd the corresponding interior angle would be 180\u00b0 - 35\u00b0 = 145\u00b0.\n\nBut the problem specifically mentions interior angles, so this approach doesn't apply.\n\nLet me recalculate once more:\nSum of interior angles for a 6-sided polygon = (6-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0\nSum of the first five angles = 127\u00b0 + 32\u00b0 + 42\u00b0 + 106\u00b0 + 18\u00b0 = 325\u00b0\nSixth angle = 720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0\n\nI believe the answer is 395\u00b0, though this seems unusual for a convex polygon.\n\n<answer>395</answer>",

Let me verify my understanding of the formula.\n\nFor a polygon with n sides, the sum of interior angles is (n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0.\nFor a hexagon (6 sides), that's (6-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 4 \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 720\u00b0.\n\nLet me double-check my addition:\n127\u00b0 + 32\u00b0 + 42\u00b0 + 106\u00b0 + 18\u00b0 = 325\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the sixth angle must be:\n720\u00b0 - 325\u00b0 = 395\u00b0\n\nThis is still problematic. Let me try one more approach.\n\nActually, I need to check if I'm misreading any of the angles:\nFirst angle: 127.0\u00b0\nSecond angle: 32.0\u00b0\nThird angle: 42.0\u00b0\nFourth angle: 106.0\u00b0\nFifth angle: 18.0\u00b0\n\nAdding these: 127 + 32 + 42 + 106 + 18 = 325\n\nSo the sixth angle would be: 720 - 325 = 395\n\nThis doesn't seem right for a convex polygon.
