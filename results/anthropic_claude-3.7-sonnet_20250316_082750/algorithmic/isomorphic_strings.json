Let me verify this mapping is consistent:\n   - For each position, the mapping should be consistent\n   - I notice that 'y' maps to 'm' consistently\n   - All other characters also map consistently\n\n4. I also need to check that no two characters in the first string map to the same character in the second string:\n   - e \u2192 d\n   - y \u2192 m\n   - j \u2192 c\n   - x \u2192 z\n   - g \u2192 i\n   - t \u2192 w\n   - m \u2192 g\n   - Each character in the second string is mapped to by exactly one character from the first string\n\nThe mapping is consistent and one-to-one, so the strings are isomorphic.\n\n<answer>True</answer>",
