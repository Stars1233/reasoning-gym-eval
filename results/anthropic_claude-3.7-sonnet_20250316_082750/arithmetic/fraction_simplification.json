Let me check:\n11830 \u00f7 1027 = 11.52...\n\nActually, that's not a whole number. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's use the Euclidean algorithm:\n11830 = 1027 \u00d7 11 + 533\n1027 = 533 \u00d7 1 + 494\n533 = 494 \u00d7 1 + 39\n494 = 39 \u00d7 12 + 26\n39 = 26 \u00d7 1 + 13\n26 = 13 \u00d7 2 + 0\n\nSo the GCD is 13.\n\nNow I can simplify the fraction:\n4108 \u00f7 13 = 316\n47320 \u00f7 13 = 3640\n\nLet me check if 316 and 3640 can be simplified further:\n316 = 4 \u00d7 79\n3640 = 4 \u00d7 910\n\nSo I can simplify further by dividing both by 4:\n316 \u00f7 4 = 79\n3640 \u00f7 4 = 910\n\nTherefore, 4108/47320 simplified to lowest terms is 79/910.\n\nActually, let me check if 79 and 910 have any common factors:\n910 = 91 \u00d7 10 = 7 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 10\n\nSo 79 and 910 don't have common factors.\n\nWait, I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:\n4108 = 4 \u00d7 1027, but that's not right.\n4108 = 4 \u00d7 1027 is incorrect.\n\nLet me redo this calculation properly:\nGCD(4108, 47320) = GCD(4108, 47320 - 4108 \u00d7 11) = GCD(4108, 2432)\nGCD(4108, 2432) = GCD(2432, 4108 - 2432 \u00d7 1) = GCD(2432, 1676)\nGCD(2432, 1676) = GCD(1676, 2432 - 1676 \u00d7 1) = GCD(1676, 756)\nGCD(1676, 756) = GCD(756, 1676 - 756 \u00d7 2) = GCD(756, 164)\nGCD(756, 164) = GCD(164, 756 - 164 \u00d7 4) = GCD(164, 100)\nGCD(164, 100) = GCD(100, 164 - 100 \u00d7 1) = GCD(100, 64)\nGCD(100, 64) = GCD(64, 100 - 64 \u00d7 1) = GCD(64, 36)\nGCD(64, 36) = GCD(36, 64 - 36 \u00d7 1) = GCD(36, 28)\nGCD(36, 28) = GCD(28, 36 - 28 \u00d7 1) = GCD(28, 8)\nGCD(28, 8) = GCD(8, 28 - 8 \u00d7 3) = GCD(8, 4)\nGCD(8, 4) = GCD(4, 8 - 4 \u00d7 2) = GCD(4, 0) = 4\n\nSo the GCD is 4.\n\nNow I can simplify the fraction:\n4108 \u00f7 4 = 1027\n47320 \u00f7 4 = 11830\n\nTherefore, 4108/47320 simplified to lowest terms is 1027/11830.\n\n<answer>1027/11830</answer>",
