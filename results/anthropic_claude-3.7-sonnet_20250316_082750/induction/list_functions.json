The output is the number that appears in the input list where the sum of its digits is odd:\n- 33: 3+3=6, which is even\n- 81: 8+1=9, which is odd \u2713\n- 17: 1+7=8, which is even\n- 77: 7+7=14, which is even\n\nLet me check all numbers in our input:\n- 30: 3+0=3, which is odd \u2713\n- 98: 9+8=17, which is odd \u2713\n- 79: 7+9=16, which is even\n- 72: 7+2=9, which is odd \u2713\n- 55: 5+5=10, which is even\n\nThat doesn't work either since we have multiple numbers with odd digit sums.\n\nLet me try another approach.

The output is the number in the list that is divisible by the sum of its digits:\n- 33: 3+3=6, and 33\u00f76=5.5 (not divisible)\n- 81: 8+1=9, and 81\u00f79=9 (divisible) \u2713\n- 17: 1+7=8, and 17\u00f78=2.125 (not divisible)\n- 77: 7+7=14, and 77\u00f714=5.5 (not divisible)\n\nLet me check our input:\n- 30: 3+0=3, and 30\u00f73=10 (divisible)\n- 98: 9+8=17, and 98\u00f717=5.76 (not divisible)\n- 79: 7+9=16, and 79\u00f716=4.94 (not divisible)\n- 72: 7+2=9, and 72\u00f79=8 (divisible)\n- 55: 5+5=10, and 55\u00f710=5.5 (not divisible)\n\nBoth 30 and 72 are divisible by the sum of their digits.\n\nLet me try one more approach.

Looking for patterns:\n- In Example 1: 33 is the only element where both digits add up to 6 (3+3=6)\n- In Example 2: 81 is the only element where both digits add up to 9 (8+1=9)\n- In Example 3: 17 is the only element where both digits add up to 8 (1+7=8)\n- In Example 4: 77 is the only element where both digits add up to 14 (7+7=14)\n\nThe pattern seems to be: find the element where the sum of its digits is unique among all elements in the list.\n\nFor the input [30, 98, 79, 72, 55]:\n- 30: 3+0=3\n- 98: 9+8=17\n- 79: 7+9=16\n- 72: 7+2=9\n- 55: 5+5=10\n\nEach element has a unique digit sum, so I need to look for another pattern.\n\nUpon further examination, I notice that in each example, the output is the element whose digit sum is a prime number:\n- Example 1: 3+3=6 (not prime)\n- Example 2: 8+1=9 (not prime)\n- Example 3: 1+7=8 (not prime)\n- Example 4: 7+7=14 (not prime)\n\nThat's not it either.\n\nLooking again, I notice the output is always the only element in the list that appears in the 3rd position (index 2) of the input array:\n- Example 1: [57, 38, 33, 62, ...] \u2192 33 is at index 2\n- Example 2: [38, 10, 81, 40, ...] \u2192 81 is at index 2\n- Example 3: [29, 85, 17] \u2192 17 is at index 2\n- Example 4: [31, 36, 77, 87, ...] \u2192 77 is at index 2\n\nSo the rule is to select the element at index 2 (3rd position) in the input list.\n\nFor input [30, 98, 79, 72, 55], the element at index 2 is 79.\n\n<answer>[79]</answer>",

Let me try another approach.\n\nI think the rule is to keep only elements at odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, etc.) in 1-based indexing, which corresponds to even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, etc.) in 0-based indexing.\n\nFor Input: [90, 72, 11, 40, 4]\n- Positions 0, 2, 4 (0-based) correspond to 90, 11, 4\n\nActually, I think I was wrong. Looking more carefully at the examples:\n- Example 1: [95, 25, 70, 14, 36] \u2192 [25, 70, 14] (positions 1, 2, 3)\n- Example 2: [83, 70, 91, 42, 91, 16, 47, 2] \u2192 [83, 91, 91, 47] (positions 0, 2, 4, 6)\n- Example 3: [50, 97, 12, 64, 66, 79, 90] \u2192 [97, 12, 64, 79] (positions 1, 2, 3, 5)\n- Example 4: [98, 87, 26, 33] \u2192 [87] (position 1)\n\nThe pattern seems to be keeping only elements at odd positions (0-indexed).
