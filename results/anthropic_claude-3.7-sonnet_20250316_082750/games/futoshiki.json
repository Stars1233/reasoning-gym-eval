The remaining numbers are 2 and 3. Since the value in row 3, column 2 (which is 2) must be greater than the value in row 4, column 2, the value in row 4, column 2 must be 1. But 1 is already in column 1 of row 4, so this is a contradiction. Let me reconsider.\n\nThe constraint actually means that the value in position (3,2) must be greater than the value in position (4,2). Since position (3,2) contains 2, position (4,2) must contain 1. But since 1 is already in position (4,1), position (4,2) must be 3, and position (4,4) must be 2.\n\nFor row 3, we have 2 and 4 already placed. The remaining numbers are 1 and 3, which must go in positions (3,1) and (3,3). Since column 3 already has 4 in row 4, position (3,3) must be 3, and position (3,1) must be 1.\n\nFor row 2, we need to place 1, 2, 3, and 4. Column 1 already has 1 in row 4, column 2 already has 2 in row 3, column 3 already has 4 in row 4, and column 4 already has 4 in row 3. So row 2 must have 4 in column 1, 3 in column 2, 2 in column 3, and 1 in column 4.\n\nFor row 1, we have 1 already placed in position (1,4).

The missing numbers are 1 and 4. Since 4 is already in column 2, it can't be in column 2 of row 4. So row 4 must be [4, 1, 3, 2].\n\nFor row 3, we have [_, 4, _, _]. Column 3 already has 3 in row 4, and column 4 has 2 in row 4. So row 3 can only have [3, 4, 1, 2] or [1, 4, 3, 2]. But with the constraint cell(2,2) > cell(3,2)=4, this means cell(2,2) can't exist (since no number > 4).
