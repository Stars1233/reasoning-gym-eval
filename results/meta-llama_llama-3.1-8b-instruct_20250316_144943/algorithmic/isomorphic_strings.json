Create two dictionaries to map characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n2. Iterate over the characters in both strings simultaneously using the zip function.\n3. For each pair of characters, check if they are already in the dictionaries. If they are, check if the mapped characters match. If not, return False.\n4. If the characters are not in the dictionaries, add them and their corresponding characters to the dictionaries.\n5. If the loop completes without returning False, return True.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\ndef is_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    s1_to_s2 = {}\n    s2_to_s1 = {}\n    \n    for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if c1 in s1_to_s2 and s1_to_s2[c1] != c2:\n            return False\n        if c2 in s2_to_s1 and s2_to_s1[c2] != c1:\n            return False\n        s1_to_s2[c1] = c2\n        s2_to_s1[c2] = c1\n    \n    return True\n\nprint(is_isomorphic(\"hfhaa\", \"ycysk\"))  # True\n```",

If they are not equal, the strings cannot be isomorphic.\n3. Iterate over the characters in the first string. For each character, check if it already exists in the dictionary.\n   - If it does, check if the mapped character in the dictionary matches the character at the same position in the second string. If not, the strings are not isomorphic.\n   - If it does not, check if the character is already in the second string. If it is, the strings are not isomorphic.\n   - If the character is not in the second string, add the mapping to the dictionary.\n4. If the loop completes without finding any discrepancies, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nIn this case, the strings \"hfhaa\" and \"ycysk\" are not isomorphic because 'h' in \"hfhaa\" maps to 'y' in \"ycysk\", but 'f' in \"hfhaa\" maps to 'c' in \"ycysk', which means 'f' cannot map to 'c' as 'c' is already mapped to 'h'.",

Create two dictionaries to store the mapping of characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa.\n2. Iterate over the characters in both strings at the same time using the zip function.\n3. For each pair of characters, add the mapping to the dictionaries if it does not already exist.\n4. If a character in the first string maps to a different character in the second string than previously seen, return False.\n5. If the function finishes iterating over all characters without returning False, return True.\n\nHere's a simple implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n\n    s1_to_s2 = {}\n    s2_to_s1 = {}\n\n    for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if c1 in s1_to_s2 and s1_to_s2[c1] != c2:\n            return False\n        if c2 in s2_to_s1 and s2_to_s1[c2] != c1:\n            return False\n        s1_to_s2[c1] = c2\n        s2_to_s1[c2] = c1\n\n    return True\n```\n\nWhen you call `is_isomorphic('fm', 'wp')`, it returns `True`.",

If they are not, they cannot be isomorphic.\n2. The lengths of \"daun\" and \"eguy\" are 4 and 4 respectively, so they can be isomorphic.\n3. Now, we need to check if there is a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings.\n4. We can create a dictionary to store the mapping between the characters.\n5. For each character in \"daun\", we need to check if it already exists in the dictionary. If it does, we check if the mapped character is equal to the corresponding character in \"eguy\". If not, we return False.\n6. If the character does not exist in the dictionary, we add it to the dictionary with its corresponding character in \"eguy\".\n7. We repeat the process for all characters in \"daun\".\n8. After checking all characters, we return True if no conflicts were found, and False otherwise.\n9. In this case, 'a' in \"daun\" maps to 'e' in \"eguy\", but 'n' in \"daun\" maps to 'y' in \"eguy\" and 'u' in \"daun\" maps to 'u' in \"eguy\" which is correct. However, 'n' in \"daun\" can't map to 'u' in \"eguy\". So, the strings are not isomorphic.",

We need to check if the characters in 'habb' can be replaced to get 'qweb' while preserving the order and mapping each character to a unique character.\n\n2. The first characters 'h' in 'habb' and 'q' in 'qweb' must be mapped to the same character. This is possible.\n\n3. The second characters 'a' in 'habb' and 'w' in 'qweb' must be mapped to the same character. This is possible.\n\n4. The third characters 'b' in 'habb' and 'e' in 'qweb' must be mapped to the same character. However, the remaining 'b' in 'habb' must be mapped to 'b' in 'qweb' as well.\n\n5. The last characters 'b' in 'habb' and 'b' in 'qweb' cannot be mapped to the same character as 'b' in 'habb' because 'b' in 'habb' has already been mapped to 'b' in 'qweb'. This is not possible.\n\nSo, 'habb' and 'qweb' are not isomorphic.",
