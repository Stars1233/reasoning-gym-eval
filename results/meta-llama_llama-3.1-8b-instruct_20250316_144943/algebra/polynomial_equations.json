We should use the cubic formula to solve the cubic equation. The cubic formula is: p = (-q/3 + sqrt(q**2/9 - r/3) / 3) or p = (-q/3 - sqrt(q**2/9 - r/3) / 3), where a = 1, b = 10, and c = -81.\n\nHere, q = 10 and r = -81.

However, 1.7442 and -2.1111 are not the roots of the equation.\n\nNow, we can plug p = -1 into the original equation to check if it is the root of the equation: 27*(-1)**3 + 10*(-1)**2 - 81 = 0\n-27 + 10 - 81 = -98. This is not equal to 0.\n\nNow, we can plug p = -5.6667 into the original equation to check if it is the root of the equation: 27*(-5.6667)**3 + 10*(-5.6667)**2 - 81 = 0\n-27026.1216 + 321.4583 - 81 = -26685.6629.
