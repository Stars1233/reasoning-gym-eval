However, since the year 2022 is not a leap year, we'll use 2022 as the year for the formula. \n\nNow we can plug these values into the Zeller's Congruence formula: \nh = (q + [(13*(m+1))/5] + K + y + [y/4] + [C/4] - 2*C) mod 7\nwhere h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, ..., 6 = Friday), \nq is the day of the month (18), \nm is the month (6), \nK is the month of January (0), \ny is the year (2022), \nC is the century year (2022), \nand 13*(m+1) is the month multiplier.\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get: \nh = (18 + [(13*(6+1))/5] + 0 + 2022 + [2022/4] + [2022/4] - 2*2022) mod 7\nh = (18 + [13*7]/5 + 0 + 2022 + [506] + [506] - 4044) mod 7\nh = (18 + 91 + 0 + 2022 + 506 + 506 - 4044) mod 7\nh = (19 + 2022 + 1012 - 4044) mod 7\nh = (19 + 3034 - 4044) mod 7\nh = 9 - 4010 mod 7\nh = -4001 mod 7\nh = 6\n\nSince the result is 6, September 18, 2022 was a Sunday.",

Wednesday, but since 31 is a multiple of 7 + 3, 31 days is 4 days after a Monday, Monday + 4 days = Friday, but 31 days is 4 days after a Monday, however 31 % 7 is 3 and 3 days after a Monday is a

Find the total number of days between the given dates.\n2. Subtract the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) from the total number of days.\n\nThe given dates are Saturday, August 27, 2022, and Wednesday, November 23, 2022.\n\nAugust has 31 days. The days between August 27 and August 31 are 5 days (Monday to Friday).\n\nSeptember has 30 days. The days between September 1 and September 30 are 30 days. Since we already counted 5 days from August 27, we need to subtract those 5 days because they are already included in the count of August 27. So, the count for September is 30 - 5 = 25.\n\nOctober has 31 days. The days between October 1 and October 31 are 31 days. Since we already counted 25 days from September, we need to subtract those 25 days because they are already included in the count of August 27. So, the count for October is 31 - 25 = 6.\n\nNovember has 30 days. The days between November 1 and November 23 are 23 days. Since we already counted 6 days from October, we need to subtract those 6 days because they are already included in the count of August 27. So, the count for November is 23 - 6 = 17.\n\nNow, let's count the weekends between August 27 and November 23, 2022:\n- August 27 to August 28 (1 day)\n- August 29 to August 30 (2 days)\n- August 31 is a Friday, so no weekend\n- September 3 to September 4 (2 days)\n- September 10 to September 11 (2 days)\n- September 17 to September 18 (2 days)\n- September 24 to September 25 (2 days)\n- October 1 to October 2 (2 days)\n- October 8 to October 9 (2 days)\n- October 15 to October 16 (2 days)\n- October 22 to October 23 (2 days)\n- October 29 to October 30 (2 days)\n- November 5 to November 6 (2 days)\n- November 12 to November 13 (2 days)\n- November 19 to November 20 (2 days)\n- November 26 is a Saturday, so no weekend\n\nThere are 24 weekends between the given dates.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of days and subtract the weekends:\nTotal number of days = (31 + 25 + 31 + 23) = 110 days\nTotal number of business days = Total number of days - Number of weekends\nTotal number of business days = 110 - 24 = 86\n\nHowever, we need to include the day August 27, which is a Saturday.

Since every week has 7 days, we divide the total number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks:\n213 / 7 = 30.43 (round down to 30 weeks because you can't have a fraction of a week)\n\n4. Since each week has one Friday, the number of Fridays is equal to the number of weeks:\n30\n\n5. However, we need to check if the first day (August 21, 2022) and the last day (October 3, 2022) are Fridays. \n- August 21, 2022 is not a Friday.\n- October 3, 2022 is a Sunday.\n\n6. Since August 21, 2022 is not a Friday, we need to add 1 to the number of weeks to include the first Friday after August 21, 2022.\n\n30 + 1 = 31",

First, we find the total number of days from April 4 to April 19, 2022:\n   April has 30 days. \n   From April 4 to April 30, there are 27 days.\n   Since we are including the end date, we add 1 to get a total of 28 days.\n\n2. Since we are only interested in Sundays, we divide the total number of days by 7 to get the total number of weeks and then find the remainder. \n   28 % 7 = 0\n\n3. Since the remainder is 0, there is 1 full week with 7 Sundays. We don't need to consider any partial week because we are including both the start and end dates.\n\n4. Therefore, the number of Sundays from Monday, April 4 to Tuesday, April 19, 2022 (including both start and end dates) is 7.",
