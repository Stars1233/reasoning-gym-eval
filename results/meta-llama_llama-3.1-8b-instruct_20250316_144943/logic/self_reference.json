This implies that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. Statement 3 says that exactly 5 statements are true. This is a specific case of Statement 1.\n\n4. Statement 4 says that exactly 2 statements are false. This is a specific case of Statement 2.\n\n5. Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means that the number of true statements is either 5 or 2, but not both.\n\n6. Statement 6 says that the number of true statements is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n7. Statement 7 says that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a natural number greater than 1 that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible solutions:\n\n- The number of true statements can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- The number of false statements can be 5, 4, 3, or 2.\n\nSince Statement 5 says that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, the number of true statements can only be 5 or 2.\n\nIf the number of true statements is 5, then the number of false statements is 2, which is not a composite number (it has no divisors other than 1 and itself). So, this case is not possible.\n\nIf the number of true statements is 2, then the number of false statements is 5, which is a composite number (it has divisors other than 1 and itself). This case is possible.\n\nHowever, Statement 6 says that the number of true statements is a prime number, and Statement 7 says that the number of false statements is a composite number. The only number that satisfies both conditions is 5 (a prime number) and 2 (a composite number) cannot be the number of false statements when the number of true statements is 5. But it can be when the number of true statements is 2.\n\nNow let's look at Statement 1 and Statement 2 which say that at least 2 statements are true and at most 3 statements are false respectively. If the number of true statements is 2, then the number of false statements is 5, which is a possible solution.\n\nSo, there is only one possible solution: the number of true statements is 2 and the number of false statements is 5.",

From statement 2, we know that the number of false statements is at most 1. This means the number of false statements can be 0 or 1.\n3. From statement 6, we know that the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than 7 are 2, 3, 5.\n4. From statement 7, we know that the number of false statements is a composite number. The composite numbers less than 7 are 4.\n5.

Combining 3 and 6, we know the number of true statements can be 2, 3, or 5.\n8. Combining 4 and 7, we know that the number of false statements can only be 4, because it is the only composite number in the list.\n9. From statement 8, we know that the number of true statements can be 3, because the number of true statements must be 7 - 4 = 3.\n10. Combining 1, 9, we know that the possible solutions are (3 true, 4 false), and that's it, there are only 1 solution when the number of true statements is 3.\n11.

From Statement 2, we know there are at most 7 false statements. Since there are 7 statements, this means there are at least 0 false statements.\n3. From Statement 3, we know exactly 2 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 1, so Statement 3 cannot be true.\n4. From Statement 4, we know exactly 2 statements are false. This implies there are at least 5 true statements, which contradicts Statement 2. So, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n5. From Statement 5, we know either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true, Statement 5 is true.\n6. Since Statement 3 is not true, the number of true statements is not exactly 2. Since Statement 4 is not true, the number of false statements is not exactly 2. Therefore, the number of true statements is either 3, 5, or 7. However, from Statement 6, the number of true statements is a prime number. This means the number of true statements is either 3 or 5 (since 7 is a prime number and cannot satisfy the condition from Statement 5).\n7. Since Statement 4 is not true, the number of false statements is not exactly 2. From Statement 7, the number of false statements is a composite number. This means the number of false statements is either 4, 6, or 7 (since 4 and 6 are composite numbers and 7 cannot satisfy the condition from Statement 5). However, from Statement 2, the number of false statements is at most 7. This means the number of false statements is either 4, 6, or 7.\n\nConsidering the possibilities for the number of true and false statements, we have the following combinations: (3 true, 4 false), (3 true, 6 false) is eliminated since it contradicts Statement 5, (5 true, 2 false) is eliminated since it contradicts Statement 4, (5 true, 2 false) is also eliminated since it contradicts Statement 4, (5 true, 2 false) is also eliminated since it contradicts Statement 4, (5 true, 2 false) is also eliminated since it contradicts Statement 4. So, the only valid combinations are (3 true, 4 false) and (5 true, 2 false) is eliminated, (5 true, 2 false) is eliminated since it contradicts statement 4. So, we are left with (3 true, 4 false) as the valid combination.\n\nThere is 1 possible solution.",

          "full_model_response": "We can analyze this problem by considering the possible combinations of true and false statements. \n\nFirst, let's consider the statements 3 and 4. If either one of them is true, then the other must be false. If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements. If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 3 false statements. \n\nGiven that the number of true statements must be a prime number and the number of false statements must be a composite number, we can deduce the following:\n\n- If there are exactly 4 true statements, then there are 3 false statements. However, 3 is a prime number, not a composite number. So, this case is impossible.\n- If there are exactly 3 true statements, then there are 4 false statements. However, 4 is a composite number, not a prime number. So, this case is also impossible.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are exactly 5 true statements. This would mean that there are 2 false statements. Since 2 is a prime number, this case is possible.\n\nWe can now consider the case where there are exactly 6 true statements. This would mean that there is 1 false statement. Since 1 is a prime number, this case is also possible.\n\nWe can now consider the case where there are exactly 7 true statements. This would mean that there are 0 false statements. Since 0 is not a prime number, this case is impossible.\n\nWe can now consider the case where there are at least 8 true statements. This would mean that there are at most -1 false statements. However, this is impossible since we can't have a negative number of false statements.\n\nTherefore, the possible number of true statements is either 5 or 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are 5 true statements. This means that Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. However, Statement 5 says that Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This is a contradiction, so this case is impossible.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are 6 true statements. This means that Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 is satisfied since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n\nSince the number of true statements is 6, Statement 6 is true. Since the number of false statements is 1, Statement 7 is false.\n\nTherefore, there is 1 possible solution: Statements 1, 2, 5, and 6 are true, and Statement 7 is false.\n\n<answer>1</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "Let's analyze the given statements step by step:\n\n1. From Statement 1, we know that at least 3 statements are true.\n2. From Statement 2, we know that at most 3 statements are false, which means at least 4 statements are true.\n3. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because Statement 5 says either one of them is true, but not both.\n4. Since Statement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number, and the possible prime numbers between 3 and 7 are 3, 5, and 7, the number of true statements must be either 3, 5, or 7.\n5. Since Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number, and the possible composite numbers between 0 and 3 are 0 and 2, the number of false statements must be either 0 or 2.\n6. From Statement 2, we know that at most 3 statements are false, so the number of false statements cannot be 0.\n7. Therefore, the number of false statements must be 2.\n8. Since the number of false statements is 2, the number of true statements must be 5.\n\nNow, let's check if this solution satisfies all the statements:\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because at least 3 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because at most 3 statements are false.\n- Statement 3 is not satisfied because exactly 5 statements are true, not 4.\n- Statement 4 is not satisfied because exactly 2 statements are false, not 3.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because the number of true statements is 5, which is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is satisfied because the number of false statements is 2, which is a composite number.\n\nSince we found a solution that satisfies all the statements, we can conclude that there is at least 1 solution.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are other possible solutions. We can try to find another solution where exactly 4 statements are true, as Statement 3 claims. Let's assume that exactly 4 statements are true. Then, the number of false statements is 3, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n\nNow, let's check if this solution satisfies all the statements:\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because at least 4 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because at most 3 statements are false.\n- Statement 3 is satisfied because exactly 4 statements are true.\n- Statement 4 is not satisfied because exactly 3 statements are false, not 4.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 is not satisfied because the number of true statements is 4, which is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is satisfied because the number of false statements is 3, which is a composite number.\n\nSince we found another solution that satisfies all the statements, we can conclude that there are at least 2 solutions.\n\nHowever, we can find another solution where exactly 3 statements are true. Let's assume that exactly 3 statements are true. Then, the number of false statements is 4, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n\nNow, let's check if this solution satisfies all the statements:\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because at least 3 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is not satisfied because at most 3 statements are false, but we have 4 false statements.\n- Statement 3 is not satisfied because exactly 3 statements are true, not 4.\n- Statement 4 is satisfied because exactly 3 statements are false.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 is not satisfied because the number of true statements is 3, which is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is satisfied because the number of false statements is 4, which is a composite number.\n\nSince we found another solution that satisfies all the statements, we can conclude that there are at least 3 solutions.\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible solutions. The number of possible solutions is the number of ways to choose 3, 4, or 5 statements to be true, which is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3, 4, and 5 statements to be true.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 statements to be true is the number of ways to choose 3 items from 7 items, which is C(7, 3) = 35.\nThe number of ways to choose 4 statements to be true is the number of ways to choose 4 items from 7 items, which is C(7, 4) = 35.\nThe number of ways to choose 5 statements to be true is the number of ways to choose 5 items from 7 items, which is C(7, 5) = 21.\n\nThe total number of possible solutions is 35 + 35 + 21 = 91.\n\n<answer>91</answer>",
