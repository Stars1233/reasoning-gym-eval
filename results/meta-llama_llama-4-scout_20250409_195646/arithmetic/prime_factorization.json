A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n## 3: Test divisibility by small prime numbers\nStart by testing divisibility by the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., and move upwards until we find a prime factor or determine that the number is prime.\n\n## 4: Determine the prime factorization\n433 is not even, so it's not divisible by 2. The sum of its digits (4 + 3 + 3 = 10) is not a multiple of 3, so it's not divisible by 3. It does not end in 5 or 0, so it's not divisible by 5. Testing divisibility by 7, 11, 13, etc., until we find a factor or confirm it's prime.\n\n## 5: Detailed check for prime factors\nUpon checking, we find that 433 is not easily divisible by small prime numbers like 7 (433 \u00f7 7 \u2248 61.86), 11 (433 \u00f7 11 \u2248 39.36), 13 (433 \u00f7 13 \u2248 33.31), 17 (433 \u00f7 17 \u2248 25.47), 19 (433 \u00f7 19 \u2248 22.79), 23 (433 \u00f7 23 \u2248 18.83), 29 (433 \u00f7 29 \u2248 14.93), 31 (433 \u00f7 31 \u2248 13.97), 37 (433 \u00f7 37 \u2248 11.70), 41 (433 \u00f7 41 \u2248 10.56), 43 (433 \u00f7 43 \u2248 10.07), 47 (433 \u00f7 47 \u2248 9.21). However, 433 \u00f7 43 = 10.069..., and more precisely, 433 is actually very close to being a product of 43 and 10, but let's check 43 precisely: 433 = 43 * 10.069... No, precisely 433 = 43 * 10.070..., actually, 433 is not divisible by 43 with a whole number result but let's try 431 and 433 closely, 433 - 43*10 = 433 - 430 = 3, indicating not a factor. Actually, checking properly: 7*61 = 427 and 433 -427 = 6. So 433 is 7*61 + 6. But actually 433 is a product of 7 and 61 plus 6, no. But 433 = 43 * 10 + 3. But actually 7 * 61 = 427.\n\n\n## 6: Final assessment of prime factorization\nGiven that 427 is 7 * 61 and 433 - 427 = 6. Let's properly assess: 433 is between 420 and 430, and 7*61=427. Hence 433 = 427 + 6 = 7*61 + 6. But there is no simple small factor. After trial and error or using calculator for prime check: 433 is actually a prime number.\n\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>433</answer>",

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n## 3: Test divisibility by small prime numbers\nStart by testing divisibility by the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., and move upwards until we find a prime factor or determine that the number is prime.\n\n## 4: Determine the prime factorization\n433 is not even, so it's not divisible by 2. The sum of its digits (4 + 3 + 3 = 10) is not a multiple of 3, so it's not divisible by 3. It does not end in 5 or 0, so it's not divisible by 5. Testing divisibility by 7, 11, 13, etc., until we find a factor or confirm it's prime.\n\n## 5: Detailed check for prime factors\nUpon checking, we find that 433 is not easily divisible by small prime numbers like 7 (433 \u00f7 7 \u2248 61.86), 11 (433 \u00f7 11 \u2248 39.36), 13 (433 \u00f7 13 \u2248 33.31), 17 (433 \u00f7 17 \u2248 25.47), 19 (433 \u00f7 19 \u2248 22.79), 23 (433 \u00f7 23 \u2248 18.83), 29 (433 \u00f7 29 \u2248 14.93), 31 (433 \u00f7 31 \u2248 13.97), 37 (433 \u00f7 37 \u2248 11.70), 41 (433 \u00f7 41 \u2248 10.56), 43 (433 \u00f7 43 \u2248 10.07), 47 (433 \u00f7 47 \u2248 9.21). However, 433 \u00f7 43 = 10.069..., and more precisely, 433 is actually very close to being a product of 43 and 10, but let's check 43 precisely: 433 = 43 * 10.069... No, precisely 433 = 43 * 10.070..., actually, 433 is not divisible by 43 with a whole number result but let's try 431 and 433 closely, 433 - 43*10 = 433 - 430 = 3, indicating not a factor. Actually, checking properly: 7*61 = 427 and 433 -427 = 6. So 433 is 7*61 + 6. But actually 433 is a product of 7 and 61 plus 6, no. But 433 = 43 * 10 + 3. But actually 7 * 61 = 427.\n\n\n## 6: Final assessment of prime factorization\nGiven that 427 is 7 * 61 and 433 - 427 = 6. Let's properly assess: 433 is between 420 and 430, and 7*61=427. Hence 433 = 427 + 6 = 7*61 + 6. But there is no simple small factor. After trial and error or using calculator for prime check: 433 is actually a prime number.\n\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>433</answer>",
