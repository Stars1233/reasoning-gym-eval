If Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements must be true because it asserts a minimum of 7 true statements out of 7.\n\n## 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 2 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that 5 or more statements must be true.\n\n## 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then all statements must be false, which directly contradicts Statement 3 itself. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false. This means 3 statements must be true.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is false (as deduced), then for Statement 5 to be true, Statement 4 must be true or false in a way that satisfies the condition of Statement 5.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements can be 2, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the prime numbers less than or equal to 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. For 7 statements, the number of false statements can be 4, 6, or any other number that is not prime.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together with Statement 5\nGiven Statement 3 is false (as it claims 0 true statements, which would make it false), and if Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are false, meaning 3 are true. This scenario satisfies Statement 5 if Statement 3 is false.\n\n## 9: Assess the Possibility of Statement 1 Being True\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all statements must be true, which would make Statement 3 false (since it claims 0 true statements). However, Statement 1 being true would also mean Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true or false in a manner that contradicts the others.\n\n## 10: Determine the Truthfulness of Statements Based on Prime and Composite Conditions\nStatement 6 indicates the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7), and Statement 7 indicates the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6, ...). If there are 3 true statements, then 4 are false, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n\n## 11: Evaluate Statement 2 and Statement 4 Together\nStatement 2 says at most 2 statements are false, and Statement 4 says exactly 4 statements are false. These cannot both be true.\n\n## 12: Consider Statement 5\u2019s Impact\nStatement 5 allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both. Given Statement 3 is false, if Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are false and 3 are true.\n\n## 13: Assess Statement 6 and Statement 7 with Other Statements\nIf 3 statements are true (as per Statement 4 being true), then Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) is satisfied because 3 is prime. Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) is also satisfied because 4 (the number of false statements) is composite.\n\n## 14: Check for Consistency Across All Statements\n- Statement 1 cannot be true because if it were, all statements would have to be true, which includes Statement 3 being true, a contradiction.\n- Statement 2 allows for up to 2 false statements, which could be consistent if there are indeed 5 or more true statements.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 being true means 3 statements are true and 4 are false.\n- Statement 5 being true means only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n- Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements (3 in this case) is prime.\n- Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements (4 in this case) is composite.\n\n## 15: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- If Statement 4 is true (3 true statements), then Statement 3 must be false, Statement 1 must be false, and Statement 2 could be false if more than 2 statements are false.\n- Statement 5 can be true if only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n- The number of true statements being 3 satisfies Statement 6 (since 3 is prime).\n- The number of false statements being 4 satisfies Statement 7 (since 4 is composite).\n\n## 16: Final Evaluation\nConsidering all statements:\n- Statement 1 is false because not all can be true given the constraints.\n- Statement 2 could be true if there are 5 or more true statements, but this conflicts with our findings.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 being true means 3 true and 4 false statements.\n- Statement 5 can be true if only one of the statements it mentions is true.\n- Statement 6 is true if there are 3 true statements (a prime number).\n- Statement 7 is true if there are 4 false statements (a composite number).\n\nThe final assessment shows that:\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 can be true (3 true, 4 false).\n- This setup (3 true, 4 false) makes Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 3 false, and potentially satisfies others.\n\n## 17: Counting Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and analysis:\n- If 3 statements are true and 4 are false, Statement 4 and Statement 6 and Statement 7 are satisfied.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n\nThe best answer is 0.",

This implies that if Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), Statement 4 cannot be true, and vice versa. However, Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they imply the same number of true statements (5), but they cannot both be false either without violating Statement 5.\n\n## 3: Assess Statement 1 and its implications.\nStatement 1 says at least 2 of these 7 statements are true. This is a broad statement that can be true or false depending on the actual number of true statements.\n\n## 4: Examine Statement 2 and its implications.\nStatement 2 says at most 3 of these 7 statements are false.

If there are 5 true statements (as per Statement 4 being true), then 2 statements are false, making Statement 7 false because 2 is not composite.\n\n## 9: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2 together\nStatement 1 says at least 4 statements are true, and Statement 2 says at most 3 statements are false. If Statement 1 is true, then we have at least 4 true statements. If Statement 2 is true, then we have at most 3 false statements.\n\n## 10: Consider all statements for consistency\n- If Statement 3 is true, all statements are false, which is a contradiction.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false. This means Statements 3, 5, 6, or 7 could be among the false ones depending on their claims.\n\n## 11: Assess Statement 5's impact\nStatement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4, but not both, are true. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## 12: Final assessment of all statements for truth values\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 3 being true leads to a contradiction as it claims no statements are true.\n- Statement 4 being true means 5 statements are true and 2 are false, which could align with some statements.\n\n## 13: Detailed evaluation of Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7\nStatement 1 (at least 4 true) and Statement 2 (at most 3 false) can both be true if there are 4 or 5 true statements. Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) give specific conditions.\n\n## 14: Solve for the number of true statements\nLet's assume there are $T$ true statements and $F$ false statements, with $T + F = 7$.\n- Statement 1: $T \\geq 4$\n- Statement 2: $F \\leq 3$\n- Statement 3: $T = 0$\n- Statement 4: $F = 2$\n- Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6: $T$ is prime.\n- Statement 7: $F$ is composite.\n\n## 15: Analyze potential solutions\nGiven Statement 4 says exactly 2 statements are false, and if true, then $T = 5$ and $F = 2$. This makes Statement 6 true (since 5 is prime) and Statement 7 false (since 2 is not composite).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 0 </answer>\n</end_header_id|end_header_id",

The prime numbers less than 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. The composite numbers less than 7 are 4 and 6.\n\n## 7: Consider possible scenarios based on Statement 3 and Statement 4\n- If Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true, which means there are 0 false statements. This scenario makes Statement 4 false (since it claims 2 statements are false) and satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2 but we must check against all.\n\n## 8: Detailed check of Statement 3 being true\nIf all statements are true (as per Statement 3), then:\n- Statement 1 is true (at least 3 true).\n- Statement 2 is true (at most 3 false, which is 0 in this case).\n- Statement 4 is false (as it claims 2 are false).\n- Statement 5 is false because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both; if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false.\n- Statement 6 is true (number of true statements, 7, is prime).\n- Statement 7 is false (0 false statements is not composite).\n\n## 9: Check consistency with Statement 6 and Statement 7\nGiven Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) and Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite), if Statement 3 is true:\n- The number of true statements is 7 (prime), so Statement 6 is true.\n- The number of false statements is 0 (not composite), so Statement 7 is false.\n\n## 10: Analyze Statement 3 being false\nIf Statement 3 is false, then not all statements can be true. We must then consider the implications of Statements 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\n## 11: Consider Statement 4 being true\nIf Statement 4 is true (exactly 2 statements are false), and given Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both), Statement 3 must be false. This scenario allows for exactly 2 false statements.\n\n## 12: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7 with new information\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. If exactly 2 statements are false (as per Statement 4 being true), then 5 statements are true. The number 5 is prime.\n\n## 13: Detailed evaluation of all statements\n- If Statement 4 is true (2 false statements), then Statement 3 must be one of the false statements (because it claims all are true).\n- Statement 1 (at least 3 true) and Statement 2 (at most 3 false) could both be true if 2 statements are false.\n- Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both) being true means if Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## 14: Checking for consistency across all statements\nGiven that Statement 4 claims exactly 2 statements are false:\n- Statement 1 is true (since at least 3 are true).\n- Statement 2 is true (since at most 3 are false, and 2 are false).\n- Statement 3 is false (as it claims all are true).\n- Statement 4 being true means 2 statements are false.\n- Statement 5 could be true if it correctly identifies one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 as true but not both.\n- Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) could be true if 5 statements are true (which is prime).\n- Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) could be true if 2 statements are false (4 is composite).\n\n## 15: Final assessment of possible solutions\nConsidering Statement 4 is true (2 false statements), and assuming Statement 3 is false:\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\nThis makes 5 statements potentially true (Statements 1, 2, 4, 6, 7) and 2 false (Statements 3, 5 or another combination).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 0 </answer>",

Statement 5 says one of them is true but not both.\n\n## 12: Prime and Composite Conditions\nThe number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) gives us constraints:\n- If there are 2 true statements, there are 5 false statements (composite).\n- If there are 3 true statements, there are 4 false statements (composite).\n- If there are 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements (not composite).\n- If there are 7 true statements, there are 0 false statements (not composite).\n\n## 13: Checking Statement Combinations\nLet's evaluate the possibility of each statement being true or false based on prime and composite conditions and direct claims.\n\n## 14: Final Assessment\nConsidering Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements):\n- For 2 true statements (prime), there are 5 false statements (composite), which fits.\n- For 3 true statements (prime), there are 4 false statements (composite), which fits.\n- For 5 true statements (prime), there are 2 false statements (not composite).\n- For 7 true statements, all statements must be true, but this contradicts Statement 1's claim of at least 7 true statements if we consider the implications of other statements.\n\n## 15: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 cannot be true because it implies all statements are true, which would make some statements false.\n- Statement 2 allows for 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 provide specific scenarios that are mutually exclusive.\n- Statement 5 allows for one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nFirst, let's analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4. Statement 3 claims exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true, and Statement 4 claims exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 3 is true, then 6 out of 7 statements are true, which means only 1 statement is false. If Statement 4 is true, then 2 out of 7 statements are false, which means 5 out of 7 statements are true.\n\n## 2: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together with Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true (6 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false because it claims 5 true statements (which would be the case if 2 statements are false). Conversely, if Statement 4 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## 3: Assess Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 says at least 3 of these 7 statements are true, and Statement 2 says at most 1 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 2 is true, then there can be 0 or 1 false statement among the 7. This implies that either 6 or 7 of the statements are true.\n\n## 4: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4, 6.\n\n## 5: Analyze Possible Scenarios Based on Statements\n- If Statement 3 is true, then 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. This would make Statement 1 true (at least 3 true), Statement 2 false (because more than 1 statement is false), Statement 4 false (because it claims 2 false statements), Statement 5 true (because Statement 3 being true makes Statement 4 false), Statement 6 true (since 6 is a prime number), and Statement 7 false (because 1 false statement is not composite). Statement 2 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true because it allows for at most 1 false statement, but here we have 1 false statement.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are false, and 5 are true. This scenario makes Statement 1 true, Statement 2 true (because only 2 statements are false), Statement 3 false (because it claims 6 true statements), Statement 5 true (because Statement 4 being true makes Statement 3 false), Statement 6 false (because 5 is not a prime number), and Statement 7 true (because 2 is a composite number).\n\n## 6: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2 with Other Statements\nGiven Statement 1 (at least 3 true) and Statement 2 (at most 1 false), if Statement 2 is true, then there can only be 0 or 1 false statement. This means either all statements are true (which would make Statement 1 true as well) or exactly one is false.\n\n## 7: Consider Prime and Composite Numbers for True and False Statements\nThe number of true statements being a prime number (Statement 6) limits the possibilities significantly because prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7. The number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) means it could be 4, 6, etc., but given we have 7 statements, only 4, 6 could be relevant as composite numbers of false statements.\n\n## 8: Detailed Examination of Statement Combinations\n- If all 7 statements were true, Statement 2 and Statement 4 would be false (because Statement 2 allows for at most 1 false statement, and Statement 4 claims exactly 2 false statements). This scenario does not work because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n- Statement 3 being true implies 6 true statements. This would make Statement 6 true (since 6 is not prime, this creates a contradiction if we consider Statement 6 must be one of the true ones).\n- For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements (6) is indeed prime, which is not the case (6 is not prime). So, if 6 statements are true, Statement 6 is false.\n\n## 9: Determine Possible Solutions\nConsidering Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime), possible numbers of true statements are 2, 3, 5, 7. \n- If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 7 are automatically false (because there are no false statements). This scenario makes Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6 potentially true but creates contradictions.\n- For 5 true statements, Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false. This scenario allows for Statement 5 to be true (as it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both).\n\n## 10: Final Evaluation\nStatement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false. If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 is false. Given Statement 5, only one of them can be true.\n\n## 11: Checking for Consistency\n- If Statement 3 is true (6 true statements), Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (since 1 statement is false), Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is true (because Statement 4 is false), Statement 6 is true (6 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (1 false statement is not composite). This scenario seems plausible but needs checking against all statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is false (because 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 2 is composite).\n\n## 12: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 3 being true means 6 statements are true. This fulfills Statement 1, makes Statement 2 false, and fulfills Statement 6.\n- Statement 4 being true means 5 statements are true and 2 are false, fulfilling Statement 1 and Statement 7.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 0 </answer>",

If all 7 statements are true (as per Statement 4), then Statement 3 cannot be true because it claims exactly 5 are true, not 7.\n\n## 5: Evaluate Statement 5 if Statement 4 is True\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 4 is true (all statements are true), then Statement 3 must be false, which aligns with Statement 5.\n\n## 6: Evaluate Statement 6 if Statement 4 is True\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. Since 7 is a prime number, Statement 6 is true if all statements are true.\n\n## 7: Evaluate Statement 7 if Statement 4 is True\nStatement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. If all statements are true, then there are 0 false statements. 0 is not considered a composite number (it's neither prime nor composite), so Statement 7 would be false.\n\n## 8: Determine the Validity of Statement 4 Being True\nGiven that Statement 4 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 7 (since 0 is not composite), Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n## 9: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then 2 statements must be false.\n\n## 10: Evaluate Statement 1 if Statement 3 is True\nStatement 1 says at least 4 of these 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then at least 4 statements being true is possible and actually required for Statement 3 to be one of the true statements.\n\n## 11: Evaluate Statement 2 if Statement 3 is True\nStatement 2 says at most 4 of these 7 statements are false. If exactly 5 statements are true (as per Statement 3), then 2 statements are false, which satisfies Statement 2.\n\n## 12: Evaluate Statement 5 if Statement 3 is True\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, which aligns with Statement 5.\n\n## 13: Evaluate Statement 6 if Statement 3 is True\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. Since 5 is a prime number, Statement 6 is true if Statement 3 is true.\n\n## 14: Evaluate Statement 7 if Statement 3 is True\nStatement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. If Statement 3 is true (2 false statements), then 2 is a prime number, not composite, making Statement 7 false.\n\n## 15: Assess the Truthfulness of Statements Given Statement 3 is True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 5, and 6 are also true. Statement 4 is false (as determined earlier), Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite), and Statement 3 being true means Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## 16: Check for Consistency with Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, which is consistent.\n\n## 17: Determine the Number of True Statements if Statement 3 is True\nWith Statement 3 being true, we have Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 as true, making 5 true statements.\n\n## 18: Evaluate Statement 1 with 5 True Statements\nStatement 1 says at least 4 of these 7 statements are true. With 5 true statements, this is satisfied.\n\n## 19: Evaluate Statement 2 with 5 True Statements\nStatement 2 says at most 4 of these 7 statements are false. With 2 false statements (Statement 4 and Statement 7), this is satisfied.\n\n## 20: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nGiven the evaluations, if Statement 3 is true, then we have 5 true statements (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and 2 false statements (4, 7), which satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\n## 21: Consider Statement 3 Being False\nIf Statement 3 is false, then we cannot have exactly 5 true statements. We must evaluate other possibilities.\n\n## 22: Assess Statement 4 Being False\nIf Statement 4 is false, then not all statements can be true. This means there must be at least one false statement.\n\n## 23: Evaluate Statement 2 with Statement 4 Being False\nStatement 2 says at most 4 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 4 is false, then we could have 1, 2, 3, or 4 false statements.\n\n## 24: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. For Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6, ...).\n\n## 25: Analyze Possible Combinations\n- If there are 5 true statements (as in Statement 3 being true), then 2 are false, which fits with Statement 6 being true (since 5 is prime) and does not fit with Statement 7 being true if we consider Statement 3's scenario.\n\n## 26: Final Assessment\nGiven Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), we satisfy Statements 1, 2, 5, and 6. Statement 4 is false, and Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is prime, not composite.\n\n## 27: Counting Solutions\nWe need to count how many combinations satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>1</answer>",

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number.

Statement 4 being false means not all statements can be false. Statement 2 being true would also make Statement 1 true because at least 2 statements (including itself) would be true.\n\n## 9: Consider Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together\nIf Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true, which means all others, including Statement 4, must be false.

Statement 1 being false means less than 2 statements are true, which aligns with Statement 3 being true. Statement 2 being false means more than 0 statements are false, which also aligns. Statement 4 being false means not all statements are false. Statement 5 being false would mean either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false; since Statement 3 is assumed true, Statement 4 must be false. Statement 6 being false means the number of true statements (1) is not a prime number, which is false because 1 is not considered a prime number. Statement 7 being false means the number of false statements (6) is not a composite number, which is false because 6 is indeed a composite number.\n\n## 12: Assess Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements must be false. However, this creates a paradox because if all statements are false, then Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n## 13: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4, 6.\n\n## 14: Consider Possible Scenarios for True Statements\n- If there are 0 true statements, then Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are false. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, and if one is true, the other must be false. Statement 5's truth value depends on Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## 15: Detailed Evaluation\nGiven Statement 4's claim that all statements are false, if it's true, then all statements, including itself, must be false, which is a contradiction.\n\n## 16: Analyzing Statement 1 and Statement 2 Together\nStatement 1 being true means at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 being true means all statements are true, which would validate Statement 1.\n\n## 17: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nLet's consider the scenarios:\n- If Statement 3 is true, all other statements must be false. This makes Statement 1 false (since only 1 is true), Statement 2 false (since not all are true), Statement 4 false (since not all are false), Statement 5 could be true or false depending on Statement 4's truth value but given Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, Statement 6 could be true or false based on the count of true statements (1 is not prime), and Statement 7 could be true or false based on the count of false statements (6 is composite).\n\n## 18: Final Assessment\nConsidering Statement 6 and Statement 7:\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) gives constraints. If there's 1 true statement, Statement 6 is false (since 1 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 6 is composite).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 0 </answer>",

This implies that all 7 statements must be true for Statement 2 to be true.\n\n## 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true. If Statement 3 is true, then all other statements must be false.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false. This means all statements must be false for Statement 4 to be true, which creates a paradox since if Statement 4 is true, it cannot be false, but if it's false, then not all statements are false.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This statement's truthfulness depends on the evaluation of Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 2 and Statement 4 for Immediate Conclusions\nIf Statement 2 is true, then all statements must be true, which would make Statement 4 false. Statement 4 being false means not all statements can be false. Statement 2 being true would also make Statement 1 true because at least 2 statements (including itself) would be true.\n\n## 9: Consider Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together\nIf Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true, which means all others, including Statement 4, must be false. However, Statement 4 claims all statements are false, which would include Statement 3, creating a contradiction.\n\n## 10: Evaluate Statement 5\nStatement 5 suggests that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## 11: Assess the Possibility of Statement 3 Being True\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly one statement is true, which means Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 must be false. Statement 1 being false means less than 2 statements are true, which aligns with Statement 3 being true. Statement 2 being false means more than 0 statements are false, which also aligns. Statement 4 being false means not all statements are false. Statement 5 being false would mean either both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false; since Statement 3 is assumed true, Statement 4 must be false. Statement 6 being false means the number of true statements (1) is not a prime number, which is false because 1 is not considered a prime number. Statement 7 being false means the number of false statements (6) is not a composite number, which is false because 6 is indeed a composite number.\n\n## 12: Assess Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements must be false. However, this creates a paradox because if all statements are false, then Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n## 13: Evaluate Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4, 6.\n\n## 14: Consider Possible Scenarios for True Statements\n- If there are 0 true statements, then Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 are false. Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true, and if one is true, the other must be false. Statement 5's truth value depends on Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## 15: Detailed Evaluation\nGiven Statement 4's claim that all statements are false, if it's true, then all statements, including itself, must be false, which is a contradiction.\n\n## 16: Analyzing Statement 1 and Statement 2 Together\nStatement 1 being true means at least 2 statements are true. Statement 2 being true means all statements are true, which would validate Statement 1.\n\n## 17: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nLet's consider the scenarios:\n- If Statement 3 is true, all other statements must be false. This makes Statement 1 false (since only 1 is true), Statement 2 false (since not all are true), Statement 4 false (since not all are false), Statement 5 could be true or false depending on Statement 4's truth value but given Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, Statement 6 could be true or false based on the count of true statements (1 is not prime), and Statement 7 could be true or false based on the count of false statements (6 is composite).\n\n## 18: Final Assessment\nConsidering Statement 6 and Statement 7:\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) gives constraints. If there's 1 true statement, Statement 6 is false (since 1 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 6 is composite).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 0 </answer>",

If Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true.\n\n## 2: Evaluate the implications of Statement 3 being true.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. This means 4 statements are false. Given Statement 1 says at least 5 are true, Statement 3 being true would make Statement 1 false. Statement 2 says at most 2 are false, which would also be false if Statement 3 is true because 4 statements would be false. Statement 4 being true would contradict Statement 3 since it claims only 1 statement is false. Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, would be true if Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false. Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number; if Statement 3 is true, then 3 true statements exist, which is a prime number, making Statement 6 true. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number; with 4 false statements, this would be true because 4 is a composite number.\n\n## 3: Assess Statement 3's truthfulness with other statements.\nIf Statement 3 is true, then Statements 3, 5, 6, and 7 could potentially be true, making 4 true statements, which contradicts Statement 3's claim of exactly 3 true statements. Thus, Statement 3 cannot be true because it leads to a contradiction with the conditions it sets.\n\n## 4: Evaluate the implications of Statement 4 being true.\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 1 statement is false. This means 6 statements are true. Statement 1 says at least 5 are true, which would be true. Statement 2 says at most 2 are false, which would be true because only 1 is false. Statement 3 says exactly 3 are true, which would be false. Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both; if Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false, which aligns with Statement 5.

Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number; with 1 false statement, this is false because 1 is not a composite number.\n\n## 5: Assess Statement 4's truthfulness with other statements.\nGiven Statement 4 is true, it implies 6 statements are true. However, Statement 6 being false (as determined) contradicts this scenario because if Statement 4 is true, then Statement 6 must also be true for the count of true statements to be consistent, but Statement 6 claims the number of true statements (6) is prime, which it is not.\n\n## 6: Consider Statement 1 and Statement 2.\nStatement 1 says at least 5 of these 7 statements are true. Statement 2 says at most 2 of these 7 statements are false.

If Statement 4 is true (meaning exactly 1 statement is false), then Statement 3 must be false. This scenario allows for Statement 5 to be true.\n\n## 8: Determine the number of true statements based on prime and composite conditions.\nStatement 6 says the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 7 says the number of false statements is a composite number; composite numbers less than 7 are 4, 6. If 6 statements are true (as per Statement 4), then 1 is false, which makes Statement 7 false because 1 is not composite.\n\n## 9: Reconcile Statements for a Solution.\nGiven the constraints:\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 6 statements are true, and 1 is false. This makes Statement 1 true, Statement 2 true, Statement 4 true, Statement 5 true (because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true), Statement 6 false (because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 false (because 1 is not composite). This results in 5 true statements (1, 2, 4, 5, and either 6 or 7 being false).\n\n## 10: Analyze Statement 6 and Statement 7 further.\nStatement 6 being false means the number of true statements (which we've considered as 6 if Statement 4 is true) is not prime, which is correct because 6 is not prime. Statement 7 being false means the number of false statements (1) is not composite, which is also correct.\n\n## 11: Conclusion on Statement Truthfulness.\nConsidering all statements, if Statement 4 is true, we have:\n- Statement 1: True (at least 5 true)\n- Statement 2: True (at most 2 false, but there's 1 false)\n- Statement 3: False (exactly 3 true)\n- Statement 4: True (exactly 1 false)\n- Statement 5: True (either 3 or 4 is true, but not both)\n- Statement 6: False (6 true statements, not prime)\n- Statement 7: False (1 false statement, not composite)\n\nThis gives us 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n\n## 12: Final Assessment.\nWith 5 true statements and 2 false statements:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7 is false.\n\n## 13: Checking Conditions.\n- Statement 1: True (at least 5 true).\n- Statement 2: True (at most 2 false).\n- Statement 3: False (exactly 3 true).\n- Statement 4: True (exactly 1 false).\n- Statement 5: True (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both).\n- Statement 6: False (not a prime number of true statements).\n- Statement 7: False (1 false statement, which is not composite).\n\nThe final number of true statements is 5, which satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5.

This scenario allows for Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 to be true but does not satisfy Statement 3, Statement 4, or Statement 5 being true.\n\n## 14: Checking for Prime and Composite Conditions\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) gives constraints. If there are 5 true statements, Statement 6 is false (since 5 is prime) and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). If there are 6 true statements, Statement 6 is true and Statement 7 is false (since 1 is not composite).\n\n## 15: Detailed Checking\nLet's assume Statement 1 is true (at least 6 true statements), then:\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n- If Statement 3 is true (4 true statements), it contradicts Statement 1.\n- If Statement 4 is true (3 false statements), it also contradicts Statement 1.\n\n## 16: Evaluating Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means if one is true, the other must be false.\n\n## 17: Final Assessment\nConsidering all statements:\n- If all 7 statements were true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 would both be false (since they claim specific numbers of true statements that contradict each other and the scenario of all being true).\n- For exactly 6 true statements: Statement 1 (true), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (depends on 3 and 4), Statement 6 (true), Statement 7 (false).\n\n## 18: Resolving Statement Truths\nGiven Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) and Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite), and knowing there are 7 statements:\n- Only specific combinations will satisfy all conditions.\n\n## 19: Specific Scenarios\n- 7 true statements: Statement 1 (true), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (false), Statement 6 (true), Statement 7 (false).

Given 7 statements, if there are 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements (not composite), if there are 6 true statements, there is 1 false statement (not composite), and if there are 7 true statements, there are 0 false statements (not composite but also not possible since 0 is not considered composite in this strict sense).\n\n## 11: Detailed Evaluation of Statements\n- Statement 1 being true implies 6 or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 2 being true allows for 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n- Statement 3 being true implies 4 true statements.\n- Statement 4 being true implies 4 true statements.\n- Statement 5 being true means Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n- Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements (T) must be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements (F) must be 4, 6, etc.\n\n## 12: Combining Information\nGiven Statement 6 and Statement 7, and knowing that there are 7 statements:\n- If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 6, and Statement 7 could potentially all be true, but this would mean Statement 3 is false (which fits) and Statement 5's truth value depends on Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## 13: Specific Analysis of Statement Combinations\n- For 7 true statements: Statement 1 (true), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (false), Statement 6 (true), Statement 7 (false). This scenario allows for Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 to be true but does not satisfy Statement 3, Statement 4, or Statement 5 being true.\n\n## 14: Checking for Prime and Composite Conditions\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) gives constraints. If there are 5 true statements, Statement 6 is false (since 5 is prime) and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite). If there are 6 true statements, Statement 6 is true and Statement 7 is false (since 1 is not composite).\n\n## 15: Detailed Checking\nLet's assume Statement 1 is true (at least 6 true statements), then:\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n- If Statement 3 is true (4 true statements), it contradicts Statement 1.\n- If Statement 4 is true (3 false statements), it also contradicts Statement 1.\n\n## 16: Evaluating Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means if one is true, the other must be false.\n\n## 17: Final Assessment\nConsidering all statements:\n- If all 7 statements were true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 would both be false (since they claim specific numbers of true statements that contradict each other and the scenario of all being true).\n- For exactly 6 true statements: Statement 1 (true), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (depends on 3 and 4), Statement 6 (true), Statement 7 (false).\n\n## 18: Resolving Statement Truths\nGiven Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) and Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite), and knowing there are 7 statements:\n- Only specific combinations will satisfy all conditions.\n\n## 19: Specific Scenarios\n- 7 true statements: Statement 1 (true), Statement 2 (true), Statement 3 (false), Statement 4 (false), Statement 5 (false), Statement 6 (true), Statement 7 (false). Here, Statement 6 and Statement 7's conditions are met (prime true statements, composite false statements not directly applicable).\n\n## 20: Conclusion\nGiven the constraints:\n- The only scenario that works for all is having a configuration that satisfies prime and composite conditions along with the direct claims.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 0 </answer>",

If there are exactly 2 true statements (Statement 3 and Statement 6 being true), then there are 5 false statements. The number 5 is not a composite number; it is a prime number. Therefore, Statement 7 is false.\n\n## 9: Evaluate the Consistency of Statements\n- Statement 1 is false (because it claims at least 4 true statements, but we have exactly 2).\n- Statement 2 is false (because it claims at most 3 false statements, but we have 5 false statements).\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true (because it correctly states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, and Statement 3 is true).\n- Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is false.\n\n## 10: Count the True Statements\nWe have Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6 as true statements. This gives us a total of 3 true statements.\n\n## 11: Re-evaluate Statements with New Information\n- Statement 1 claims at least 4 statements are true, which is false.\n- Statement 2 claims at most 3 statements are false, which is true because we have 4 false statements.\n- Statement 3 claims exactly 2 statements are true, which is false because we have 3 true statements.\n- Statement 4 is false (as previously determined).\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number, which is true because 3 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. Since there are 4 false statements, and 4 is a composite number, Statement 7 is true.\n\n## 12: Resolve the Paradox\nGiven that Statement 3 is false (from Step 11), and we actually have 3 true statements (Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7), we need to re-evaluate the truthfulness of all statements based on this new count.\n\n## 13: Final Assessment\n- Statement 1 is false (since not at least 4 are true).\n- Statement 2 is true (since at most 3 can be false, and we have 4 false statements, this statement is actually false).\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is true.\n\n## 14: Conclusion on True and False Statements\nWe have 3 true statements (Statements 5, 6, and 7) and 4 false statements (Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4). Let's verify:\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is false (because there are 4 false statements, not at most 3).\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is true.\n\n## 15: Final Verification\nWith 3 true statements:\n- Statement 1 (\"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true\") is false.\n- Statement 2 (\"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false\") is false because there are 4 false statements.\n- Statement 3 (\"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true\") is false.\n- Statement 4 (\"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false\") is false.\n- Statement 5 (\"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\") is true.\n- Statement 6 (\"The number of true statements is a prime number\") is true.\n- Statement 7 (\"The number of false statements is a composite number\") is true because 4 (the number of false statements) is a composite number.\n\nThe final count of true statements is 3, which matches our findings.\n\n## 16: Determine the Number of Possible Solutions\nGiven the constraints and verifications:\n- The number of true statements is 3 ( Statements 5, 6, and 7).\n- This satisfies Statement 6 (prime number of true statements).\n- It also satisfies Statement 7 (composite number of false statements, as 4 is composite).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>1</answer>",

This implies that if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number.

This satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n- Statement 4 being true also means 4 statements are true and 3 are false.\n\n## 17: Checking for Prime and Composite Conditions\n- The number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) is satisfied if there are 2, 3, 5, or 7 true statements.\n- The number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) is satisfied if there are 4, 6, or more false statements.\n\n## 18: Combine Information\nGiven Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true (by Statement 5), and if Statement 3 is true (4 true, 3 false), Statement 4 is false. If Statement 4 is true (4 true, 3 false), Statement 3 is false.\n\n## 19: Final Assessment\nLet's assume Statement 3 is true (4 true statements). Then:\n- Statement 1 is true (at least 2 true).\n- Statement 2 is true (at most 3 false).\n- Statement 4 is false (because Statement 3 is true).\n- Statement 5 is true (either Statement 3 or 4, but not both).\n- Statement 6 could be true if 4 (the number of true statements) is prime, which it is not.\n- Statement 7 could be true if 3 (the number of false statements) is composite, which it is not.\n\n## 20: Checking for Consistency\nIf there are exactly 4 true statements:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true because it allows for one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 (number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## 21: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements and their implications:\n- If Statement 3 is true, we have 4 true and 3 false statements.

This implies that 4 statements are true.\n\n## 5: Analyzing Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## 6: Analyzing Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. The prime numbers among these are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyzing Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. The possible number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Composite numbers among these are 4, 6.\n\n## 8: Evaluating Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together with Statement 5\nIf Statement 3 is true (exactly 4 statements are true), then Statement 4 must be false (because Statement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both). Conversely, if Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## 9: Checking for Consistency\n- If Statement 3 is true, then 4 statements are true and 3 are false. This would make Statement 4 false (since it claims 3 statements are false, implying 4 are true). Statement 5 would then be true because it allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both. Statement 6 could be true if 4 is not a prime number (which it isn't), and Statement 7 could be true if 3 (the number of false statements) is a composite number (which it isn't). Statement 1 is true because at least one statement (Statement 3) is true. Statement 2 is true because at most 3 statements (in this case, 3) are false.\n\n## 10: Detailed Evaluation of Statements\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- For Statement 2 to be true, given that we have a scenario where Statement 3 is true (4 true statements), it means at most 3 can be false, which aligns with our count if Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 3 being true means 4 statements are true and 3 are false.\n- Statement 4 being false means 3 statements are false and 4 are true, which aligns with Statement 3 being true.\n- Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false.\n- Statement 6 says the number of true statements is prime. With 4 true statements, this doesn't hold because 4 is not prime.\n- Statement 7 says the number of false statements is composite. With 3 false statements, this doesn't hold because 3 is not composite.\n\n## 11: Finding a Consistent Solution\nLet's evaluate the possibilities based on prime and composite numbers and the statements' claims:\n- If there are 4 true statements (as per Statement 3), then Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are true, and Statements 4, 6, 7 are false. This gives us 4 true and 3 false statements.\n\n## 12: Checking Statement 6 and Statement 7\n- The number of true statements being a prime number (Statement 6): 4 is not prime.\n- The number of false statements being composite (Statement 7): 3 is not composite.\n\n## 13: Evaluating Statement 5\u2019s Impact\nStatement 5 allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true but not both. If Statement 4 is true (3 false statements), then Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## 14: Detailed Check\n- Suppose Statement 3 is true (4 true statements). Then Statement 4 is false. Statement 5 could be true if only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not prime. Statement 7 is false because 3 is not composite.\n\n## 15: Final Assessment\nGiven Statement 1 is true, and assuming Statement 3 is true (4 true statements), we have:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True (since 3 false statements is at most 3)\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: False\n- Statement 5: True (because only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true)\n- Statement 6: False (because 4 is not prime)\n- Statement 7: False (because 3 is not composite)\n\nThis scenario gives us 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n\n## 16: Verifying Against All Statements\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true (at most 3 false statements).\n- Statement 3 is true (exactly 4 true statements).\n- Statement 4 is false (exactly 3 false statements).\n- Statement 5 is true (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both).\n- Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime).\n- Statement 7 is false (3 is not composite).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nFirst, we note that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because if exactly 1 statement is true (Statement 3), then Statement 4, which claims all statements are false, must be false. Conversely, if Statement 4 is true, then all statements must be false, which would make Statement 3 false as well. Thus, only one of them can be true.\n\n## 2: Evaluate Statement 3\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 1 of the 7 statements is true. This would mean Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are all false. Statement 1 being false means fewer than 4 statements are true, which aligns with Statement 3 being the only true statement. Statement 2 being false means more than 2 statements are false, which also aligns because 6 statements would be false. Statement 4 being false means not all statements are false, which aligns with Statement 3 being true. Statement 5 being false would imply both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false, but since we've assumed Statement 3 is true, this creates a contradiction because Statement 4 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true. Thus, Statement 3 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## 3: Evaluate Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements are false. This would mean Statement 1 is false (fewer than 4 statements are true), Statement 2 is false (more than 2 statements are false, which would be 6 in this case), Statement 3 is false (more than 1 statement is true, which contradicts Statement 4), Statement 5 is false (because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and if Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false), Statement 6 is false (the number of true statements is not a prime number because it's 1, which is prime, but this is a contradiction since we assumed Statement 4 is true), and Statement 7 is false (the number of false statements is not composite because there are 6 false statements, and 6 is composite). However, if all statements are false as Statement 4 claims, then Statement 4 itself being false would confirm that not all statements can be false, creating a paradox.\n\n## 4: Assess Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the analysis, if Statement 3 is true, it leads to contradictions. If Statement 4 is true, it also leads to contradictions. Therefore, Statement 5 must be true because it allows for the possibility of one being true and the other false without directly causing a paradox.\n\n## 5: Determine the Truth of Statements Based on Statement 5\nGiven Statement 5 is true, and it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we have two scenarios:\n1. Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false.\n2. Statement 4 is false, and Statement 3 is false.\n\n## 6: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 says at least 4 of these statements are true. Statement 2 says at most 2 of these statements are false. If Statement 3 is false (as per our second scenario in Step 5), then Statement 1 could potentially be true if there are at least 4 true statements.\n\n## 7: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.\n\n## 8: Analyze Possible Combinations\n- If Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true, which makes Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7 false.

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 3 and Statement 4\nFirst, we note that Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because if exactly 1 statement is true (Statement 3), then Statement 4, which claims all statements are false, must be false. Conversely, if Statement 4 is true, then all statements must be false, which would make Statement 3 false as well. Thus, only one of them can be true.\n\n## 2: Evaluate Statement 3\nIf Statement 3 is true, then exactly 1 of the 7 statements is true. This would mean Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are all false. Statement 1 being false means fewer than 4 statements are true, which aligns with Statement 3 being the only true statement. Statement 2 being false means more than 2 statements are false, which also aligns because 6 statements would be false. Statement 4 being false means not all statements are false, which aligns with Statement 3 being true. Statement 5 being false would imply both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true or both are false, but since we've assumed Statement 3 is true, this creates a contradiction because Statement 4 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true. Thus, Statement 3 being true leads to a contradiction with Statement 5.\n\n## 3: Evaluate Statement 4\nIf Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements are false. This would mean Statement 1 is false (fewer than 4 statements are true), Statement 2 is false (more than 2 statements are false, which would be 6 in this case), Statement 3 is false (more than 1 statement is true, which contradicts Statement 4), Statement 5 is false (because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and if Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false), Statement 6 is false (the number of true statements is not a prime number because it's 1, which is prime, but this is a contradiction since we assumed Statement 4 is true), and Statement 7 is false (the number of false statements is not composite because there are 6 false statements, and 6 is composite). However, if all statements are false as Statement 4 claims, then Statement 4 itself being false would confirm that not all statements can be false, creating a paradox.\n\n## 4: Assess Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Given the analysis, if Statement 3 is true, it leads to contradictions. If Statement 4 is true, it also leads to contradictions. Therefore, Statement 5 must be true because it allows for the possibility of one being true and the other false without directly causing a paradox.\n\n## 5: Determine the Truth of Statements Based on Statement 5\nGiven Statement 5 is true, and it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, we have two scenarios:\n1. Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false.\n2. Statement 4 is false, and Statement 3 is false.\n\n## 6: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2\nStatement 1 says at least 4 of these statements are true. Statement 2 says at most 2 of these statements are false. If Statement 3 is false (as per our second scenario in Step 5), then Statement 1 could potentially be true if there are at least 4 true statements.\n\n## 7: Consider Statement 6 and Statement 7\nStatement 6 claims the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Statement 7 claims the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.\n\n## 8: Analyze Possible Combinations\n- If Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement is true, which makes Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7 false. Statement 4 being false means not all statements are false. Statement 5 being true means either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, which aligns with our assumption. Statement 6 being false means the number of true statements (1) is not prime, which is incorrect because 1 is not considered a prime number. Statement 7 being false means the number of false statements (6) is not composite, which is incorrect because 6 is indeed composite.\n\n## 9: Detailed Evaluation of Statement Combinations\nLet's assume there are $T$ true statements and $F$ false statements, with $T + F = 7$.\n- Statement 1 being true means $T \\geq 4$.\n- Statement 2 being true means $F \\leq 2$.\n- Statement 3 being true means $T = 1$.\n- Statement 4 being true means $T = 0$.\n- Statement 5 being true helps to distinguish between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n- Statement 6 being true means $T$ is prime.\n- Statement 7 being true means $F$ is composite.\n\n## 10: Solve for Possible Values of T and F\nGiven Statement 6 and Statement 7, and knowing $T + F = 7$:\n- If $T = 0$, then $F = 7$, which is composite, and 0 is not prime.\n- If $T = 1$, then $F = 6$, which is composite, and 1 is not prime.\n- If $T = 2$, then $F = 5$, which is not composite, and 2 is prime.\n- If $T = 3$, then $F = 4$, which is composite, and 3 is prime.\n- If $T = 4$, then $F = 3$, which is not composite, and 4 is not prime.\n- If $T = 5$, then $F = 2$, which is not composite, and 5 is prime.\n- If $T = 6$, then $F = 1$, which is not composite, and 6 is not prime.\n- If $T = 7$, then $F = 0$, which is not composite, and 7 is prime.\n\n## 11: Apply Conditions to Find Valid Solutions\nStatement 1: $T \\geq 4$.\nStatement 2: $F \\leq 2$.\nStatement 3: $T = 1$.\nStatement 4: $T = 0$.\nStatement 5: Either $T = 1$ or $T = 0$ but not both.\nStatement 6: $T$ must be prime.\nStatement 7: $F$ must be composite.\n\n## 12: Conclusion\nConsidering all statements and their implications:\n- Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n- If Statement 3 is true, $T = 1$, $F = 6$; Statement 6 is false (1 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (6 is composite).\n- The only scenario that could potentially work without immediate contradiction is when we have a number of true statements that satisfy all conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 0 </answer>",

Given Statement 5's condition (either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both), if Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## 10: Final Evaluation\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 3 being true implies 5 true statements.\n- Statement 4 being true implies 6 true statements.\n\n## 11: Detailed Check\nFor Statement 3 to be true (5 true statements):\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true (because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n- Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime).\n- Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not composite).\n\nThis scenario makes Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 true and Statements 4, 7 false, which fits.\n\n## 12: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nWe need to find which of these scenarios can coexist:\n- The number of true statements must satisfy all conditions simultaneously.\n\n## 13: Final Assessment\nConsidering all statements:\n- If there are exactly 5 true statements (Statement 3 true), then Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 are true, and Statements 4, 7 are false. This satisfies the conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 2 </answer>",

This would mean Statement 1 is true (at least 3 of these 7 statements are true, which is obviously satisfied), Statement 2 is true (at most 3 of these 7 statements are false, which is satisfied because 0 are false), Statement 4 is false (because it claims exactly 2 are false), Statement 5 is false (because it claims one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true but not both, and if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, but this would not satisfy \"but not both\" if we consider Statement 3's claim), Statement 6 is true (the number of true statements is a prime number, 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (the number of false statements is a composite number, 0 is composite). However, if all statements are true, then Statement 4 being false satisfies Statement 5's condition indirectly but creates a contradiction because Statement 4 cannot be true if Statement 3 is true.\n\n## 5: Consider Statement 4 Being True\nIf Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false.

Statement 4 being true means 5 statements are true and 2 are false. This scenario makes Statement 3 false, Statement 4 true, Statement 5 true (since only one of them can be true), Statement 6 true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 false (since 2 is not composite).

This gives us two scenarios to consider based on the truth of Statements 3 and 4.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number.

Statement 3 claims exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true, and Statement 4 claims exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false. If Statement 3 is true, then only 1 statement can be true, which means Statement 3 itself must be the only true statement, making all other statements false. However, if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false because it claims 5 false statements, which would include Statement 3 itself, creating a contradiction if Statement 3 were true. On the other hand, Statement 4 says exactly 5 statements are false. If Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements must be true (Statement 4 and one other), which could potentially include Statement 3 but not exclusively since Statement 3 cannot be true if it says only one statement is true and Statement 4 is one of them.\n\n## 2: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together with Statement 5\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.

This satisfies Statement 4 but not Statement 3 and Statement 4 simultaneously due to Statement 5.\n- Statement 2 allows for up to 2 false statements, which means 5 or more can be true.\n\n## 17: Prime and Composite Considerations\nThe number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) helps narrow down possibilities.\n\n## 18: Final Assessment\nGiven the constraints:\n- Statement 1 cannot be true because it requires all statements to be true, which would make Statement 7 false (since 0 false statements is not composite).\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are true and 2 are false. This makes Statement 3 false (because it also claims 5 true statements but Statement 5 restricts one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true).\n- Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and Statement 7 (composite number of false statements) must be evaluated with possible solutions.\n\n## 19: Detailed Checking of Statements\n- For 7 true statements, all statements must be true, which contradicts Statement 1 being false if we consider its claim of at least 7 true statements as impossible since it would validate itself and others falsely.\n- Statement 2 (at most 2 false) and Statement 4 (exactly 2 false) can coexist if 5 statements are true.\n\n## 20: Conclusion\nStatement 1 being false allows for variability. Statement 6 being true limits the true statements to 2, 3, 5, or 7. Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6, ...). Given these, let's assess feasible solutions:\n- 5 true, 2 false: Satisfies Statement 4, Statement 6 (if 5 is prime), and Statement 7 (2 is not composite, but 5 true and 2 false works for other statements).\n\n## 21: Checking Feasibility\n- If there are 5 true statements, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- The only feasible scenario that could work given all constraints needs to satisfy prime true statements and composite false statements.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>0</answer>\n</end_header_id|end_header_id",

If Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements must be true because it claims a minimum of 7 true statements out of 7.\n\n## 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 2 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that 5 or more statements must be true.\n\n## 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then 2 statements must be false.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false. This means 5 statements must be true.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This implies that if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. The possible number of false statements that are composite are 4, 6, etc., since 0, 1, 2, and 3 are not composite.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 1 and its Implications\nIf Statement 1 is true, then all statements must be true, which would mean there are 0 false statements. This scenario does not satisfy Statement 7 because 0 is not a composite number.\n\n## 9: Consider the Possibility of Statement 1 Being False\nIf Statement 1 is false, then not all statements can be true. This means there must be at least one false statement.\n\n## 10: Examine Statements 3 and 4 Together\nStatements 3 and 4 cannot both be true because they specify different numbers of true statements (5 and 5, respectively, but Statement 4 implies 5 true statements and Statement 3 also implies 5 true statements). However, they can both be false.\n\n## 11: Assess Statement 5's Impact\nStatement 5 says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.

Given 7 statements, if there are 5 true statements, there are 2 false statements, which is not composite (it's prime), but if there are 2 true statements, there are 5 false statements, which is composite.\n\n## 13: Evaluate Statement 2\nStatement 2 says at most 2 of these statements are false. This means 5 or more statements can be true.\n\n## 14: Combine Information\n- If Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 4 is also true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- Statement 4 being true means 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n- Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements (2, 3, 5, or 7) must be prime.\n\n## 15: Detailed Evaluation\nGiven Statement 4 (exactly 2 false statements), if true, it means 5 statements are true. Statement 3 also suggests 5 true statements. Statement 6 suggests a prime number of true statements, which could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. Statement 7 suggests a composite number of false statements.\n\n## 16: Checking for Consistency\n- If 5 statements are true (as per Statement 3 or 4), then 2 are false.

For Statement 7, if there are 3 false statements, then 4 statements are true, making the number of false statements (3) not composite but also not aligning with Statement 7's requirement directly since 3 is not composite.\n\n## 12: Consider all statements for consistency.\n- If Statement 3 is true, there are 6 true statements. This makes Statement 6 true (since 6 is prime) and Statement 7 false (since 1 false statement is not composite).\n- If Statement 4 is true, there are 4 true statements and 3 false statements. Statement 6 could be true if 4 is prime (which it is not), and Statement 7 could be true if 3 (the number of false statements) is composite (which it is not).\n\n## 13: Determine possible solutions based on prime and composite conditions.\nThe number of true statements being prime (Statement 6) and the number of false statements being composite (Statement 7) gives constraints. If there are 4 true statements, then Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 3 is composite).\n\n## 14: Final assessment of Statements.\nGiven Statement 1 is true, and assuming Statement 3 is false (because if it's true, it creates a specific scenario), we evaluate:\n- Statement 3 being false means not all statements can be evaluated as true or false without considering others.\n\n## 15: Conclusion based on prime and composite numbers.\nConsidering Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) and Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite), and given that:\n- A prime number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- A composite number of false statements could be 4, 6, etc.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 0 </answer>",

If Statement 3 is true, then 1 statement must be false.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false, which means all 7 statements must be true.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This gives us two scenarios to consider: (a) Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or (b) Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The possible number of true statements that are prime are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. The number of false statements being composite means it could be 4, 6, or any other composite number less than or equal to 7.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2 Together\nIf Statement 1 is true (at least 6 true), and Statement 2 is true (at most 2 false), then the possible number of false statements is 0, 1, or 2, which aligns with 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n## 9: Consider Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together\nStatement 3 being true means 6 statements are true, and Statement 4 being true means all 7 statements are true. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false (because Statement 5 says one but not both can be true). If Statement 4 is true, then all statements must be true.\n\n## 10: Assess Statement 5's Impact\nStatement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 4 is true (all statements true), then Statement 3 must be false. If Statement 3 is true (6 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false.\n\n## 11: Examine Statement 6 and Statement 7\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements (6 or 7, given Statement 1 and Statement 2) must be prime. 7 is prime, but 6 is not.\n\n## 12: Determine Possible Scenarios\n- If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true because they make mutually exclusive claims about the number of true statements. Statement 1 and Statement 2 would both be true. Statement 6 would be true (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 would be false (since 0 is not composite). This scenario makes Statement 4 true and Statement 3 false, which aligns with Statement 5.\n\n## 13: Evaluate Statement 5 with Other Statements\nGiven Statement 5, if Statement 4 is true (all statements are true), then Statement 3 must be false. This scenario (all true) makes Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7 true or false based on their claims.\n\n## 14: Consider the Implications of Each Statement Being True or False\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are true, which means Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 being true means the number of true statements (7) is prime.\n- Statement 7 being true means the number of false statements (0) is composite, which is not true since 0 is not considered composite.\n\n## 15: Final Assessment\nGiven that Statement 4 claims all statements are true, and if that were the case:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 5 is false because it says either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, and here both can't be true simultaneously in this context.\n- Statement 6 is true because 7 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 0 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\nThe final evaluation must consider the truthfulness and consistency across all statements.\n\n## 16: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nStatement 4 being true would make Statement 3 false. Statement 5 would then be true because it says one of them is true but not both. However, we must find a scenario that satisfies all conditions given.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 0 </answer>",

Then Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true: 3 false, 4 true. Then Statement 3 is false.\n\n## 15: Conclusion\nGiven Statement 6 (the number of true statements is prime) and Statement 7 (the number of false statements is composite), and considering Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or 4 but not both), we evaluate:\n- If 4 statements are true (Statement 3), then Statement 6 is satisfied (4 is not prime, mistake) and Statement 7 could be satisfied if 3 (false statements) is composite (it's not).\n- The only prime number of true statements that could fit is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 2 </answer>",

This means if there are 4 or 6 false statements, Statement 7 is true.\n\n## 7: Determine the possible number of true statements based on Statement 6 and Statement 7.\nIf Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements must be 2, 3, or 5 (since 7 is not possible because then all statements would be true, which would make Statement 7 false, and we have to consider all statements). Statement 7 being true implies that the number of false statements (which would be 7 minus the number of true statements) is composite.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 with Statement 6 and Statement 7.\n- If Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 6 is also true because 5 is a prime number.

This scenario has 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n- Statement 4 being true (2 false statements) means 5 statements are true. This directly contradicts Statement 3.\n\n## 11: Examine the prime and composite conditions further.\nGiven Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) and Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite), let's examine possible scenarios:\n- If there are 2 true statements, then there are 5 false statements. 5 is not composite (it's prime), so Statement 7 is false. Statement 6 is false because 2 is prime, but this scenario doesn't fit well with other statements directly.\n- If there are 3 true statements, then 4 are false. 4 is composite, so Statement 7 is true. 3 is prime, so Statement 6 is true.

If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false, which makes the number of true statements (6) not prime, creating a contradiction if we consider Statement 3's truthfulness directly.\n\n## 13: Final Assessment\nGiven Statement 3 (exactly 6 true statements), if it's true, then:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 being true means 6 statements are true and 1 is false.\n- Statement 4 must be false because it claims 5 false statements.\n- Statement 5 could be true or false depending on Statement 3 or Statement 4's truth value, but since Statement 3 is considered true, Statement 4 must be false.\n- Statement 6 (number of true statements is prime) is false because 6 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 (number of false statements is composite) is true because 1 (the number of false statements) is not composite.\n\n## 14: Detailed Check of Statements with Statement 3 True\n- With Statement 3 true, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 5's truth depends on Statement 4 being false, Statement 6 is false (because 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (because 1 is not composite).\n\n## 15: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements and their implications:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 5, 7 are true, and Statements 4, 6 are false. This gives us 6 true statements and 1 false statement, which aligns with Statement 3.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>1</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that at least 4 of these 7 statements are true. This gives us a range of possible true statements from 4 to 7.\n\n## 2: Analyze Statement 2\nStatement 2 claims that at most 2 of these 7 statements are false. This means that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, or 2, which implies that the number of true statements can be 7, 6, or 5.\n\n## 3: Analyze Statement 3\nStatement 3 claims that exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true. If this is true, then 2 statements are false.\n\n## 4: Analyze Statement 4\nStatement 4 claims that exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false. This implies that only 1 statement is true.\n\n## 5: Analyze Statement 5\nStatement 5 claims that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then only 1 statement is true.\n\n## 6: Analyze Statement 6\nStatement 6 claims that the number of true statements is a prime number. Prime numbers up to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## 7: Analyze Statement 7\nStatement 7 claims that the number of false statements is a composite number. Composite numbers up to 7 are 4, 6. This means the number of true statements can be 3 or less, but since we have statements claiming specific numbers of true or false statements, we need to consider all in context.\n\n## 8: Evaluate Statement 3 and Statement 4 Together\nIf Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), then Statement 4 must be false because it claims 1 true statement. If Statement 4 is true (1 true statement), then Statement 3 must be false.\n\n## 9: Consider Statement 5's Impact\nStatement 5 being true means that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, but not both. So, if Statement 3 is true, 5 statements are true, and if Statement 4 is true, 1 statement is true.\n\n## 10: Assess Statement 6 and Statement 7 for Prime and Composite Conditions\nFor Statement 6 to be true, the number of true statements must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7). For Statement 7 to be true, the number of false statements must be composite (4, 6).\n\n## 11: Combine Information\n- If Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true, and 2 are false. This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true) and Statement 2 (at most 2 false).\n- Statement 4 being true would mean only 1 statement is true, which contradicts Statement 3 but could satisfy other conditions.\n\n## 12: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2 for Consistency\nStatement 1 and Statement 2 together suggest that there could be a range of true statements (4 to 7) and a limited range of false statements (0 to 2).\n\n## 13: Detailed Evaluation of Statements\n- Statement 3 (5 true) and Statement 4 (1 true) cannot both be true due to Statement 5.\n- If 5 statements are true (Statement 3), then Statements 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 need evaluation for consistency.\n\n## 14: Checking for Consistency Across Statements\n- Statement 3 being true means 5 true statements. This makes Statement 1 true, Statement 2 true (since 2 false statements is within \"at most 2\"), and Statement 6 could be true if 5 is prime.\n- Statement 4 being true means only 1 statement is true, which would make Statement 3 false.\n\n## 15: Final Assessment\nGiven Statement 3 as true (5 true statements), we assess:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 could be true because it allows for one of Statement 3 or 4 to be true but not both.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is prime.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 (false statements) is not composite.\n\n## 16: Conclusion on Possible Solutions\nConsidering all statements:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are true, making 5 true statements. This fits with Statement 6 (prime number of true statements) and makes Statement 7 false (since 2 false statements is not composite).\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer> 1 </answer>",
