          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Identify the complex numbers and the operation\nTo divide complex numbers, we use the formula: $\\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \\frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)} = \\frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}$. Here, $a = 20.0$, $b = 22.0$, $c = 4.0$, and $d = -6.0$.\n\n## 2: Apply the formula for division\nSubstitute the given values into the formula: $\\frac{(20.0 + 22.0i)}{(4.0 - 6.0i)} = \\frac{(20.0 + 22.0i)(4.0 + 6.0i)}{(4.0)^2 - (-6.0)^2}$ is incorrect; the correct calculation directly uses $(4.0 - 6.0i)(4.0 + 6.0i)$ for the denominator.\n\n## 3: Calculate the numerator and denominator separately\nNumerator: $(20.0 + 22.0i)(4.0 + 6.0i) = (20.0*4.0 - 22.0*(-6.0)) + (20.0*6.0 + 22.0*4.0)i = (80.0 + 132.0) + (120.0 + 88.0)i = 212.0 + 208.0i$.\n\n## 4: Calculate the denominator\nDenominator: $(4.0)^2 - (-6.0)^2$ is incorrect for complex division; correctly it should be $(4.0)^2 + (-6.0)^2 = 16.0 + 36.0 = 52.0$.\n\n## 5: Correctly calculate the division\n$\\frac{(20.0 + 22.0i)}{(4.0 - 6.0i)} = \\frac{(20.0 + 22.0i)(4.0 + 6.0i)}{(4.0)^2 + (-6.0)^2} = \\frac{212.0 + 208.0i}{52.0}$.\n\n## 6: Simplify the result\n$\\frac{212.0}{52.0} + \\frac{208.0}{52.0}i = 4.0769 + 4.0i$ (approximately), but let's calculate precisely: $\\frac{212}{52} + \\frac{208}{52}i = 4.07692307692 + 4i$.\n\n## 7: Provide the precise calculation\nReal part: $\\frac{212}{52} = 4.07692307692$ and Imaginary part: $\\frac{208}{52} = 4$.\n\n## 8: Write down the precise answer\nThe precise calculation yields: $4.07692307692 + 4i$.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<answer>4.07692307692 + 4i</answer>",
