      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is an extension of the standard Tower of Hanoi problem solution for more than 3 pegs. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is optimal for the 4-peg case. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Frame-Stewart Algorithm Basics\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves moving the top n-k disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the largest k disks to their destination, and finally moving the n-k disks on top of the k disks. The optimal solution for 4 pegs involves finding the right number of disks (k) to move in the second step.\n\n\n## 2: Determine the Optimal k\nFor 7 disks and 4 pegs, we determine k. The algorithm suggests using k=2 for the 7-disk problem as a common approach for optimization.\n\n\n## 3: Apply the Frame-Stewart Algorithm\nGiven that we are moving from Peg 2 to Peg 3, let's denote Peg 1 as the auxiliary peg for the initial moves, Peg 4 as another auxiliary peg, and follow the standard naming.\n\n\n## 4: Execute the Moves\nThe sequence for moving 7 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using 4 pegs (let's call them A=2, B=3, C=1, D=4 for simplicity) involves several steps based on the Frame-Stewart algorithm.\n\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is an extension of the standard Tower of Hanoi problem solution for more than 3 pegs. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is optimal for the 4-peg case. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Frame-Stewart Algorithm Basics\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves moving the top n-k disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the largest k disks to their destination, and finally moving the n-k disks on top of the k disks. The optimal solution for 4 pegs involves finding the right number of disks (k) to move in the second step.\n\n\n## 2: Determine the Optimal k\nFor 7 disks and 4 pegs, we determine k. The algorithm suggests using k=2 for the 7-disk problem as a common approach for optimization.\n\n\n## 3: Apply the Frame-Stewart Algorithm\nGiven that we are moving from Peg 2 to Peg 3, let's denote Peg 1 as the auxiliary peg for the initial moves, Peg 4 as another auxiliary peg, and follow the standard naming.\n\n\n## 4: Execute the Moves\nThe sequence for moving 7 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using 4 pegs (let's call them A=2, B=3, C=1, D=4 for simplicity) involves several steps based on the Frame-Stewart algorithm.\n\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the Tower of Hanoi Problem with 4 Pegs\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs is a variation of the classic problem, which typically involves 3 pegs. The addition of a 4th peg introduces more complexity and potentially more efficient solutions. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, we aim to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n\n## 2: Break Down the Problem\nTo solve this, we can use a strategy that involves moving disks to auxiliary pegs (Peg 1 and Peg 2) before finally moving them to the destination peg (Peg 4). The problem can be approached by first moving the top disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the larger disks out of the way, and finally assembling the disks on the destination peg.\n\n## 3: Apply the Frame-Stewart Algorithm\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is an efficient method for solving the Tower of Hanoi with more than 3 pegs. It involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and moving them in a way that minimizes the number of moves. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a strategy similar to this algorithm.\n\n## 4: Execute the Frame-Stewart Algorithm for 6 Disks and 4 Pegs\nThe optimal solution for 6 disks with 4 pegs involves several steps, but a straightforward application of the algorithm is complex without visual aids. Generally, for n disks and 4 pegs, the minimum number of moves is given by the formula $2^{n-2} + 2$ for n \u2265 2 (though this can vary based on the specific strategy used).\n\n## 5: Provide the Sequence of Moves\nGiven the complexity and without loss of generality, a common approach to solve this involves:\n- Moving the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg (e.g., Peg 1) using Peg 2 as a temporary storage.\n- Moving the bottom 3 disks to the destination peg (Peg 4) or another auxiliary peg.\n- Then reassembling.\n\nHowever, providing the exact sequence for 6 disks and 4 pegs manually is cumbersome and prone to error without applying a specific algorithm step-by-step.\n\n## 6: Specific Moves for 6 Disks and 4 Pegs\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n</answer>",

          "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the Tower of Hanoi Problem with 4 Pegs\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs is a variation of the classic problem, which typically involves 3 pegs. The addition of a 4th peg introduces more complexity and potentially more efficient solutions. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, we aim to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n\n## 2: Break Down the Problem\nTo solve this, we can use a strategy that involves moving disks to auxiliary pegs (Peg 1 and Peg 2) before finally moving them to the destination peg (Peg 4). The problem can be approached by first moving the top disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the larger disks out of the way, and finally assembling the disks on the destination peg.\n\n## 3: Apply the Frame-Stewart Algorithm\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is an efficient method for solving the Tower of Hanoi with more than 3 pegs. It involves dividing the disks into smaller groups and moving them in a way that minimizes the number of moves. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a strategy similar to this algorithm.\n\n## 4: Execute the Frame-Stewart Algorithm for 6 Disks and 4 Pegs\nThe optimal solution for 6 disks with 4 pegs involves several steps, but a straightforward application of the algorithm is complex without visual aids. Generally, for n disks and 4 pegs, the minimum number of moves is given by the formula $2^{n-2} + 2$ for n \u2265 2 (though this can vary based on the specific strategy used).\n\n## 5: Provide the Sequence of Moves\nGiven the complexity and without loss of generality, a common approach to solve this involves:\n- Moving the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg (e.g., Peg 1) using Peg 2 as a temporary storage.\n- Moving the bottom 3 disks to the destination peg (Peg 4) or another auxiliary peg.\n- Then reassembling.\n\nHowever, providing the exact sequence for 6 disks and 4 pegs manually is cumbersome and prone to error without applying a specific algorithm step-by-step.\n\n## 6: Specific Moves for 6 Disks and 4 Pegs\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n<answer>\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n</answer>",

      "best_full_model_response": "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is an efficient solution for more than 3 pegs.

peg.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the optimal number of disks to move in the first step\nFor 5 disks and 4 pegs, a common approach is to use k=2 for the Frame-Stewart algorithm for efficiency.\n\n## 2:

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understand the Tower of Hanoi Problem with 4 Pegs\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time. 2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. 3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. With 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex and is known as the Frame-Stewart algorithm for more than 3 pegs.\n\n## 2: Apply the Frame-Stewart Algorithm for 4 Pegs and 6 Disks\nFor 4 pegs (A, B, C, D) and 6 disks, we use a variation of the algorithm that tries to minimize the number of moves. The optimal solution for the Tower of Hanoi with 4 pegs and n disks involves a specific sequence that can be determined by the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is an extension of the standard Tower of Hanoi solution for 3 pegs.\n\n## 3: Determine the Optimal Number of Moves\nThe optimal number of moves for the Tower of Hanoi problem with n disks and 4 pegs can be given by the formula:\n\\[ T(6, 4) = 2 \\times T(3, 4) + T(6-3, 4) \\]\nHowever, calculating directly:\n- For n=6 and k=4 pegs, a known result is 31 moves.\n\n## 4: Break Down the Problem into Manageable Parts\nTo solve it step by step:\n- Move the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg (Peg 2), using Peg 4 as a temporary storage.\n- Move the bottom 3 disks to the destination peg (Peg 4), using the other pegs for temporary storage.\n- Then move the top 3 disks on top of the bottom 3.\n\n## 5: Execute the Move Sequence\nThe sequence will involve moving disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4.\n\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n\nHowever, providing a step-by-step for 6 disks and 4 pegs directly in text without visual aids or recursive application of Frame-Stewart is cumbersome.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time. 2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. 3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

      "best_full_model_response": "## Step 1: Understanding the Tower of Hanoi Problem with 4 Pegs\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time. 2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. 3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. With 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex and is known as the Frame-Stewart algorithm for more than 3 pegs.\n\n## 2: Applying the Frame-Stewart Algorithm for 4 Pegs and 6 Disks\nFor 4 pegs (A, B, C, D) and 6 disks, we use a variation of the algorithm that tries to move the disks efficiently. The basic idea for n disks and 4 pegs involves:\n- Moving the top n-2 disks to an auxiliary peg (not the destination peg),\n- Moving the largest disk to the destination peg,\n- Then moving the n-2 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nHowever, with 4 pegs, we can optimize further. The optimal solution for 6 disks involves several steps that can be generalized but require specific sequences.\n\n## 3: Breaking Down the Move for 6 Disks\nTo move 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4:\n1. Move the top 5 disks to Peg 3 (using Peg 2 as an auxiliary),\n2. Move the largest disk (6) to Peg 4,\n3.
