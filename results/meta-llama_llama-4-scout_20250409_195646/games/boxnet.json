      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['target_blue', 'target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[2.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\n\n",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'target_green'], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])']\n\n",

The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)']\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 3.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 3.5]: I am in square[1.5, 3.5], I can observe ['target_blue'], I can do []\n\n",

We see:\n- box_blue at [0.5, 0.5]\n- box_green at [0.5, 1.5]\n- box_red at [0.5, 2.5]\nAnd targets:\n- target_blue\n- target_red\n- target_green\n\nHowever, the exact coordinates of the targets are not provided, but we can infer their presence and the goal to match boxes with targets.\n\n## 3: Plan the Moves\nGiven the observations and capabilities:\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5] should move box_blue to target_blue if it's adjacent or can be moved efficiently.\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5] has box_green and can move it to target_green if directly possible or to an adjacent square.\n3. Agent[0.5, 2.5] has box_red and needs to move it to target_red.\n\n## 4: Determine Efficient Moves\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move box_blue to square[0.5, 1.5] as an intermediate step if target_blue is not directly accessible.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move box_green directly to target_green if it's at [0.5, 1.5] or adjacent.\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move box_red to square[0.5, 1.5] as an intermediate step.\n\n## 5: Create Action Plan\nAssuming target_blue, target_green, and target_red are at [0.5, 1.5], [0.5, 2.5], and [0.5, 0.5] respectively for simplicity:\n1. Move box_blue to target_blue: Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves box_blue to square[0.5, 1.5].\n2. Move box_green to target_green: Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves box_green to target_green.\n3. Move box_red to target_red: Agent[0.5, 2.5] moves box_red to square[0.5, 1.5] then to target_red.\n\nHowever, exact target locations aren't specified, so let's assume:\n- target_blue is near Agent[0.5, 0.5]\n- target_green is near Agent[0.5, 2.5]\n- target_red is near Agent[0.5, 1.5]\n\n## 6: Generate Action Plans\nGiven the assumption that targets are near the agents or boxes, let's create a simple plan:\n1. Agent[0.5, 0.5]: move(box_blue, target_blue)\n2. Agent[0.5, 1.5]: move(box_green, target_green)\n3. Agent[0.5, 2.5]: move(box_red, target_red)\n\nBut since we need to follow the format and ensure efficiency and given the direct information:\n- Agent[0.5,0.5] can move box_blue to square[0.5,1.5]\n- Agent[0.5,1.5] can move box_green to target_green or another square\n- Agent[0.5,2.5] can move box_red to square[0.5,1.5]\n\n## 7: Final Action Plan\nLet's assume direct moves to targets if possible:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\nHowever, given that we prioritize matching boxes to targets and assuming direct access:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n```",

However, Agent[1.5, 0.5] observes 'target_blue' but has 'box_green'. \n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] has 'box_red' and can move it towards 'target_red' but 'target_red' is not in its observable squares directly.\n\n## 3: Plan Actions for Efficiency\nGiven that Agent[0.5, 1.5] observes ['target_red'], it seems efficient to move 'box_red' towards 'target_red'. \n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] can move 'box_red' to square[1.5, 0.5] or square[0.5, 1.5]. Let's move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5] as it's closer to 'target_red'.\n\n## 4: Execute First Move\nFirst action plan:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"}]\n```\n\n## 5: Reassess and Plan Next Steps\nAfter the first move:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] has no boxes.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] observes ['target_red', 'box_red'] and can move 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] still has 'box_green' and observes ['target_blue'].\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] observes ['box_blue', 'target_green'].\n\n## 6: Determine Next Actions\nNext, prioritize moving 'box_red' to 'target_red' since Agent[0.5, 1.5] can now see 'box_red' and 'target_red'.\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}]\n```\n\n## 7: Continue Planning\nNow, focus on 'box_green' and 'box_blue':\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] can move 'box_green' to either square[0.5, 0.5] or square[1.5, 1.5]. Let's move it towards Agent[1.5, 1.5] or directly if possible.\n\n## 8: Execute Next Move\nHowever, Agent[1.5, 1.5] has 'box_blue' and a 'target_green'. It seems efficient to move 'box_green' towards its potential target or swap if beneficial.\n\n## 9: Detailed Action Plan\nLet's assume 'target_green' and 'target_blue' are at [2.5,1.5] and [1.5,2.5] respectively for illustration, though not directly provided.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' to square[0.5, 1.5] or square[1.5, 0.5].\n\n## 10: Finalize Action Plans\nGiven constraints and aiming for efficiency:\n1. Move 'box_red' to 'target_red': Already planned.\n2. Move 'box_green' and 'box_blue' to their targets efficiently.\n\n## 11: Construct Detailed Plans\nGiven Agent observations and possible moves:\n- Move 'box_red' to 'target_red': Done.\n- For 'box_green' and 'box_blue', find shortest paths.\n\n## 12: Action Plan for Multiple Steps\nAssuming direct moves and targets:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\nHowever, we must ensure conflict resolution and efficiency.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_green, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_green)\"}\n]\n```",

The goal is to move the colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\n\n## 2: Identify Possible Actions for Each Agent\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] observes nothing but can move.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] observes a 'box_green' and can move it to adjacent squares or a target of the same color if visible.\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] observes a 'target_green' but cannot move.\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] observes a 'target_red' but cannot move.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] observes a 'box_red' and can move it.\n- Agent[1.5, 2.5] observes a 'target_blue' but cannot move.\n- Agent[2.5, 0.5] observes nothing but can move.\n- Agent[2.5, 1.5] observes a 'box_blue' and can move it.\n- Agent[2.5, 2.5] observes nothing but can move.\n\n## 3: Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets\nThe priority is to match boxes with their targets directly if possible.\n\n## 4: Determine the First Set of Actions\nAgent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to 'target_red' at [1.5, 0.5].\nAgent[2.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' to 'target_blue' at [1.5, 2.5] but since Agent[0.5, 1.5] has 'box_green' and there's a 'target_green' at [0.5, 2.5], we should consider moves that directly match boxes with targets.\n\n## 5: Plan the Moves\n1. Move 'box_red' from [1.5, 1.5] to [1.5, 0.5] (target_red).\n2. Move 'box_green' from [0.5, 1.5] to [0.5, 2.5] (target_green).\n3. Move 'box_blue' from [2.5, 1.5] to [1.5, 2.5] then to [1.5, 2.5] seems optimal as Agent[2.5,1.5] can push it towards the target.\n\n## 6: Create Action Plan for Step 1\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 2.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## 7: Re-evaluate and Plan Subsequent Moves\nAfter the first move, re-evaluate the positions and possible actions.\n\n## 8: Continue Planning Until All Boxes Match Targets\nContinue this process iteratively until all boxes are matched with their targets.\n\n## 9: Example Second Step\nAssuming the first move doesn't immediately resolve everything:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_green' closer to 'target_green'.\n- Agent[2.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' towards its target.\n\n## 10: Detailed Action Plan\nGiven the complexity and need for iterative planning, let's assume a simplified scenario for demonstration:\n- First, Agent[1.5,1.5] moves 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n- Then, Agent[0.5,1.5] moves 'box_green' towards 'target_green'.\n\n## 11: Finalize Action Plans\nLet's finalize with an example plan, considering direct moves to targets or adjacent squares efficiently.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 2.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```",

The goal is to create a sequence of actions that will move all boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets efficiently.\n\n## Step 2: Identify Possible Actions for Each Agent\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] observes 'box_green' and can move it to square[1.5, 0.5] or square[0.5, 1.5].\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] observes 'box_blue' and 'target_blue', and can move 'box_blue' to square[1.5, 1.5], square[0.5, 0.5], or 'target_blue'.\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] observes 'target_red' and 'target_green' but has no boxes to move.\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] observes 'box_red' and can move it to square[0.5, 1.5] or square[1.5, 0.5].\n\n## 3: Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets\nThe most efficient first step is to prioritize moving boxes directly to their targets if possible.\n\n## 4: Determine the First Set of Actions\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' directly to 'target_blue' because it observes both.\n\n## 5: Plan Subsequent Actions\nAfter Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' to 'target_blue', we re-evaluate:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] can then focus on moving 'box_green' towards its target, but we first need to identify where the target for 'box_green' is.\n\n## 6: Assume Targets and Boxes Locations\nAssuming 'target_green' is at [1.5,1.5] and 'target_red' is at [0.5,0.5] for simplicity, and given that Agent[1.5, 1.5] has 'box_red', we should plan moves accordingly.\n\n## 7: Create Action Plan for First Step\nGiven the observations:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5]: \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n- Other agents should wait or move boxes towards targets or adjacent squares if it brings them closer to their goal.\n\n## 8: Detailed Action Plan\n1. First, Agent[0.5, 1.5] moves 'box_blue' to 'target_blue'.\n2. Then, assess if any agent can move a box to its target directly or indirectly.\n\n## 9: Second Step of Planning\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] can move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5] or square[1.5, 0.5]. Let's move 'box_red' to square[0.5, 1.5] for now.\n\n## 10: Generate Action Plan\nGiven the information and goal to minimize moves:\n- The first action plan could be:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## 11: Further Planning\nAfter the first move, re-evaluate positions and possible moves.\n\n## 12: Continue Planning\nLet's assume 'target_green' is near [1.5,0.5] and 'target_red' is at [0.5,0.5], adjust plans:\n- Agent[0.5, 0.5] moves 'box_green' towards 'target_green'.\n\n## 13: Detailed Plan Over Multiple Steps\nGiven constraints and goals, let's outline a multi-step plan efficiently matching boxes with targets.\n\n## 14: Example Plan\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n```",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7.

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3.

Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])']\nAgent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])']\n\n",

Possible action: move 'box_green' to square[0.5, 2.5].\n\n## Step 2: Determine Priorities and Actions\nGiven the observations, prioritize matching boxes to their targets:\n- Agent[0.5, 2.5] can move 'box_red' to 'target_red' directly, which is a high priority.\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] can move 'box_blue' but has no direct target observed.\n\n## 3: Plan Actions for Efficiency\n1. **Agent[0.5, 2.5]** should move 'box_red' to 'target_red' as it's a direct match.\n2. **Agent[0.5, 1.5]** should move 'box_blue' towards a potential target or an agent that can use it, but there's no 'target_blue' observed directly.\n\n## 4: Sequential Planning\n### Step 1:\n- **Agent[0.5, 2.5]**: move(box_red, target_red)\n\n### Step 2:\nAfter the first move, re-evaluate:\n- **Agent[0.5, 1.5]**: Can move 'box_blue' to Agent[0.5, 0.5] or [0.5, 2.5], but no target is directly observed.\n\n## 5: Continue Planning\n### Step 3:\nAssume Agent[0.5, 2.5] has moved 'box_red' to 'target_red'. Now:\n- **Agent[0.5, 1.5]**: move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5]) to get closer to potential target or another agent.\n\n## 6: Detailed Action Plan\nGiven the constraints and observations:\n1. **Step 1**:\n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n```\n\n2. **Step 2**: \n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}\n```\n\n3. **Step 3**: Assuming Agent[0.5, 2.5] has 'box_red' at 'target_red', and 'box_blue' is moved to [0.5, 2.5]:\n```json\n{\"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\"}\n```\n\nHowever, detailed step-by-step planning with optimal moves requires considering agent movements and box interactions precisely.\n\n## 7: Finalizing Action Plans\nLet's finalize with an optimal strategy considering direct moves to targets and efficiency:\n- Move 'box_red' to 'target_red' directly.\n- Move 'box_blue' towards a potential target or another agent.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 2.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square.

No boxes observed.\n- **Agent[2.5, 2.5]**: No boxes or targets observed.\n\n### Planning Moves\n\nGiven the observations and capabilities:\n\n1. **Move `box_red` to `target_red` if directly possible or move it closer**: Since `Agent[1.5, 0.5]` observes `box_red` and there's no `target_red` in its vicinity or observed list directly, it should move `box_red` to a square that gets it closer to `target_red` or directly to it if seen.\n\n2. **Move `box_green` towards `target_green`**: `Agent[1.5, 1.5]` sees `box_green` and should move it towards `target_green` if directly possible or to an adjacent square that gets it closer.\n\n3. **Move `box_blue` towards `target_blue`**: Assuming there's a `target_blue` and `box_blue` is observed by an agent, move it directly to the target.\n\n### Detailed Plan\n\nLet's assume the existence of targets and boxes not directly observed but implied through the task:\n\n- **target_red** at [1.5,2.5]\n- **target_green** at [2.5,2.5]\n- **target_blue** at [0.5,2.5]\n- **box_red** at [1.5,0.5]\n- **box_green** at [1.5,1.5]\n- **box_blue** at [2.5,0.5]\n\n### Action Plan\n\nGiven the initial setup, let's create a multi-step plan:\n\n#### Step 1\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, square[1.5, 2.5])\"}\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 2 (Adjust based on Step 1 outcomes)\nAfter moving boxes closer to their potential targets or each other:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nHowever, without exact locations of all targets and boxes, and to adhere strictly to the format and problem-solving approach:\n\n### Final Action Plan (Hypothetical Complete Information)\n\nLet's assume all agents can see their respective boxes and targets and plan accordingly:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\nBut to follow the sequential and specific action plan directive accurately with given agent capabilities and observations:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5,0.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[1.5,1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5,0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[2.5,1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5,1.5]\":\"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5,0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5,0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[2.5, 1.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_green, target_green)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n```",

Agent[1.5, 1.5] can see target_green and box_green, making it a prime candidate for an immediate match.\n\n## 4: Plan the First Set of Actions\nGiven the observations:\n- Agent[1.5, 1.5] should move box_green to target_green if possible, as it directly matches a box to its target.\n\n## 5: Generate the First Action Plan\nThe first action plan could be:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## 6: Re-evaluate the State After the First Action\nAfter Agent[1.5, 1.5] moves box_green to target_green, we re-evaluate:\n- Agent[0.5, 1.5] can still move box_blue.\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] can still move box_red.\n\n## 7: Plan Subsequent Actions\nAgent[0.5, 1.5] should move box_blue to target_blue if it's within reach or to a position that facilitates future moves.\n\n## 8: Generate the Second Action Plan\nAssuming target_blue is at [0.5, 1.5] or can be reached by moving box_blue to an adjacent square first:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 0.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\nHowever, direct movement to targets should be prioritized.\n\n## 9: Optimize for Efficiency and Direct Moves to Targets\nIf Agent[0.5, 1.5] can see target_blue and box_blue, it should move box_blue directly to target_blue.\n\n## 10: Finalize Action Plans\nGiven the direct movements and observations:\n- Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves box_red to target_red if directly possible.\n\n## 11: Construct a Comprehensive Plan\nLet's assume target_red is at [1.5, 0.5] or nearby, and target_blue is at [0.5, 1.5]:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\nThis plan directly matches boxes with their targets where possible.\n\n## 12: Validate Against Constraints\nEnsure no two agents interfere and all actions are valid.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n```",

It should move 'box_red' to 'target_red' as it's a direct match.\n\n### Action Plan for Step 1\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Further Analysis\n\nAfter the first move:\n- **Agent[1.5, 2.5]** has moved 'box_red' to 'target_red'.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Agent[1.5, 0.5]** observes 'box_green'. The closest target isn't specified, but it can move it to an adjacent square.\n\n### Assumption for Targets and Boxes\n\nAssuming 'target_green' is at [2.5,0.5] for demonstration:\n\n### Action Plan for Step 2\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHowever, without specific locations of all targets and boxes, we prioritize direct matches and efficiency.\n\n### General Approach\n\n1. **Direct Matches**: Prioritize moving boxes directly to their targets if observable.\n2. **Adjacent Moves**: If a direct match isn't possible, move boxes towards their potential targets or to a square that could facilitate a match in the next step.\n\n### Example Action Plan with Multiple Steps\n\nLet's assume there are boxes and targets as follows but without exact coordinates for all:\n\n### Step 1\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"}\n]\n```\n\n### Step 2 (if box_green is near Agent[1.5,0.5] and target_green is near [2.5,0.5])\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[2.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\n### Full Sequence Example\n\nGiven the complexity and without a detailed grid of all box and target locations, a general approach would involve:\n\n1. Identifying direct matches and executing them.\n2. Moving boxes towards potential targets or into positions for easier matching.\n\n### Sample Output\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nHowever, given the specific problem details and constraints, let's assume a simplified scenario where direct movements are prioritized and provide a structured plan:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n```",

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]).

Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2.

Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3.

The optimal plan seems to involve moving boxes towards their targets directly or incrementally.\n\n### Optimal Plan\n\nLet's refine and provide an optimal plan assuming direct movements and visibility:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n\nBut since only one action per agent per step is allowed and we have to follow the format strictly, let's assume a distribution of boxes and targets that allows for a step-by-step resolution.\n\n### Final Action Plan\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n```\n<answer>\n[\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"},\n  {\"Agent[1.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"}\n]\n</answer>\n```",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6.

Let's assume 'box_red' is closer to 'target_red' observed by **Agent[0.5, 2.5]**.\n\n2. **Agent[1.5, 0.5]** has 'box_blue' and can move it towards 'target_blue' observed by **Agent[1.5, 1.5]**.\n\n### Step 1 Action Plan\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Further Steps\n\nAs the problem evolves, we continue planning:\n\n- **Agent[0.5, 3.5]** moves 'box_red' closer to 'target_red'.\n- **Agent[1.5, 0.5]** moves 'box_blue' closer to 'target_blue'.\n\n### Step 2 Action Plan\n\nLet's assume **Agent[0.5, 2.5]** can observe 'box_red' now and **Agent[1.5, 1.5]** can see both 'target_blue' and 'target_green'.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHowever, detailed step-by-step planning requires iterative observations and adjustments based on the previous state. Given the complexity and the need for a clear step-by-step plan without visual aids, let's focus on a simplified and direct approach based on given data and constraints.\n\n### Final Action Plan\n\nGiven the constraints and goal to prioritize matching boxes to targets:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n<answer>\n[\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, square[1.5, 1.5])\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_red, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\": \"move(box_blue, target_blue)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[0.5, 3.5]\": \"move(box_green, square[0.5, 2.5])\",\n    \"Agent[0.5, 2.5]\": \"move(box_red, target_red)\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"Agent[1.5, 1.5]\": \"move(box_green, target_green)\"\n  }\n]\n</answer>\n```",

      "question": "\nYou are a central planner tasked with directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes to their corresponding color-coded targets.\nEach agent occupies a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects within its square. Agents can move a box to an adjacent square or\ndirectly to a target square of the same color. A square may contain multiple boxes and targets. The squares are identified by their center\ncoordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]). Actions are formatted as: move(box_color, destination), where box_color is the color of the box and\ndestination is either a target of the same color or an adjacent square. Your objective is to create a sequence of action plans that instructs\neach agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets in the most efficient manner.\n\nPlease adhere to the following rules when specifying your action plan:\n1. Single Action per Agent: Assign only one action to each agent at a time. However, the final answer shoule be a list of action plans for multiple steps.\n2. Unique Agent Keys: Use unique keys for each agent in the JSON format action plan. The key should be the agent's coordinates in the format \"Agent[x, y]\".\n3. Prioritize Matching Boxes to Targets: Always prioritize actions that will match a box to its target over moving a box to an adjacent square.\n4. Sequential Action Planning: The whole returned answer should be a list of action plans for multiple steps, do not just return one step plan.\n5. Clear Formatting: Ensure the action plan is clearly formatted in JSON, with each agent's action specified as a key-value pair.\n6. Conflict Resolution: Ensure that no two agents are assigned actions that would interfere with each other.\n7. Optimize Efficiency: Aim to minimize the number of moves required to match all boxes with their targets.\n\nHere is the format for your action plan:\nPlease provide your final answer as a list of action dictionaries.\nFor example:\n```json\n[{\"Agent[0.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])\", \"Agent[1.5, 0.5]\":\"move(box_red, target_red)\"}, {\"Agent[0.5, 1.5]\":\"move(box_blue, target_blue)\", \"Agent[2.5, 0.5]\":\"move...}, {...}...]\n```\nInclude an agent in the action plan only if it has a task to perform next.\n\n\nThe current left boxes and agents are: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe [], I can do []\nAgent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_red', 'target_blue', 'target_green'], I can do ['move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])']\nAgent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_blue', 'box_green'], I can do ['move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])']\n\n",
