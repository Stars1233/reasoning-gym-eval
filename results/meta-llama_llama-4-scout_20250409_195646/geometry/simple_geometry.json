Summing them gives 41.0 + 81.0 + 87.0 = 209.0\u00b0.\n\n## 5: Find the measure of the last interior angle\nTo find the measure of the last interior angle, subtract the sum of the first 3 angles from the total sum of interior angles for a 4-sided polygon: 360\u00b0 - 209.0\u00b0 = 151.0\u00b0.\n\n<answer>151.0</answer>",
