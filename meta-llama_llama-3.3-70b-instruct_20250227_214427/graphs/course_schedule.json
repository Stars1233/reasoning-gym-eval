For the given prerequisites [(1, 0), (2, 0)], we have two edges: one from 0 to 1 and another from 0 to 2.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the in-degree of each course\nNext, we calculate the in-degree of each course, which is the number of edges pointing to it. Course 0 has an in-degree of 0, course 1 has an in-degree of 1, and course 2 has an in-degree of 1. Courses 3 and 4 have no prerequisites, so their in-degrees are also 0.\n\n## Step 3: Use a queue to process courses with no prerequisites\nWe use a queue to store courses with an in-degree of 0, which are the courses that can be taken first. Initially, courses 0, 3, and 4 are in the queue.\n\n## Step 4: Process each course in the queue\nWe process each course in the queue, reducing the in-degree of its neighboring courses by 1 each time we remove a course from the queue. If a course's in-degree becomes 0, it is added to the queue.\n\n## Step 5: Check if all courses can be finished\nAfter processing all courses in the queue, we check if all courses have been processed. If the total number of courses processed is equal to the total number of courses (5 in this case), then we can finish all courses.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the process to the given problem\nApplying the above steps to the given problem:\n- Start with courses 0, 3, and 4 in the queue.\n- Process course 0: Remove it from the queue and decrease the in-degree of courses 1 and 2 to 0. Add courses 1 and 2 to the queue.\n- Process courses 1 and 2: Remove them from the queue. No new courses are added to the queue because there are no more prerequisites.\n- Process courses 3 and 4: Remove them from the queue.\n- All courses have been processed.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>True</answer>",

For example, if we have a prerequisite (a, b), we draw an arrow from b to a, indicating that b must come before a.\n\n2. **Detect Cycles:** If the graph contains a cycle, it means there's no way to order the courses such that all prerequisites are met before taking a course. For example, if A requires B, and B requires A, there's a cycle, and you cannot fulfill both requirements.\n\nGiven the prerequisites [(1, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4), (2, 0), (0, 1), (4, 3), (3, 1), (2, 3)], let's build the graph and detect for cycles.\n\nWe have the following prerequisites:\n- Course 1 requires 2\n- Course 0 requires 4\n- Course 2 requires 4\n- Course 2 requires 0\n- Course 0 requires 1\n- Course 4 requires 3\n- Course 3 requires 1\n- Course 2 requires 3\n\nLet's analyze for cycles:\n- A cycle can be observed in the requirements: Course 0 requires Course 1, Course 1 requires Course 2, Course 2 requires Course 0. Another way to see it is through the direct and indirect dependencies, like Course 0 requiring Course 1 and Course 1 requiring Course 2, but since Course 2 also requires Course 0, it creates a cycle (0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0).\n\nThis cycle indicates that we cannot fulfill all course prerequisites without violating some conditions, thus making it impossible to finish all courses as per the given prerequisites.\n\n<answer>False</answer>",

For the given list of prerequisites [(0, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2)], we can represent the graph as follows:\n- Course 0 has a prerequisite of course 2.\n- Course 2 has a prerequisite of course 1.\n- Course 3 has a prerequisite of course 2.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the in-degree of each course\nNext, we calculate the in-degree of each course, which is the number of edges pointing to it. This will help us identify courses with no prerequisites.\n- Course 0 has an in-degree of 1 (prerequisite of course 2).\n- Course 1 has an in-degree of 1 (prerequisite for course 2).\n- Course 2 has an in-degree of 1 (prerequisite for courses 0 and 3, but only counts as 1 because in-degree counts incoming edges, not the number of courses it's a prerequisite for).\n- Course 3 has an in-degree of 1 (prerequisite of course 2).\n- Course 4 has an in-degree of 0 (no prerequisites).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Topological Sorting algorithm\nWe use the Topological Sorting algorithm to order the courses in a way that for every edge (u,v), course u comes after v in the ordering. This algorithm can help us determine if it's possible to finish all courses.\n- Start with courses that have an in-degree of 0, which means they have no prerequisites. In this case, course 4.\n- Remove course 4 from the graph and decrease the in-degree of its neighboring nodes by 1. However, since course 4 has no prerequisites and is not a prerequisite for any other course in the given list, its removal does not affect the in-degrees of other courses.\n- Continue this process. Since course 4 does not affect the in-degrees of other courses, we look for other courses with an in-degree of 0 after the initial removal. However, upon reevaluation, we see that we must consider the impact of removing a course on the prerequisites of other courses.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if a cycle exists\nA cycle in the graph indicates that it's impossible to finish all courses because a course is a prerequisite for another course that is also a prerequisite for it, either directly or indirectly.\n- Looking at the prerequisites [(0, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2)], we see that course 0 requires course 2, course 2 requires course 1, but there's no direct or indirect requirement that creates a cycle involving all courses.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the algorithm considering the actual prerequisites\n- Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree of 0), which initially seems to be only course 4.\n- Course 4 can be taken first since it has no prerequisites.\n- After taking course 4, we still have courses 0, 1, 2, and 3 with their prerequisites.\n- Course 1 has no prerequisites other than itself not being a prerequisite for any other course in a way that creates a cycle, so it can be taken next.\n- After taking course 1, course 2 can be taken because its prerequisite (course 1) has been fulfilled.\n- With course 2 taken, both courses 0 and 3 can be taken because their prerequisite (course 2) has been fulfilled.\n\n## Step 6: Conclusion\nGiven the prerequisites and applying the topological sorting algorithm, we can order the courses in a way that allows all of them to be taken without violating any prerequisites. Thus, it is possible to finish all courses.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>True</answer>",

Initially, all in-degrees will be 0, but as we iterate over the prerequisites, we'll update the in-degree of each course accordingly.\n\n## Step 3: Populate the graph and update the in-degree dictionary based on the given prerequisites.\nFor each prerequisite (a, b) in the given list, we add b to the list of prerequisites for course a in the graph and increment the in-degree of course a by 1.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize a queue with courses that have an in-degree of 0, which means they can be taken first.\nSince we can take a course only after taking all its prerequisites, we start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree of 0).\n\n## Step 5: While the queue is not empty, we pop a course, decrease the in-degree of all courses for which the popped course is a prerequisite by 1, and add them to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0 after this decrement.\nBy decreasing the in-degree of the affected courses, we're essentially marking them as possible to be taken next because we've already considered one of their prerequisites. When an in-degree reaches 0, it means we've accounted for all its prerequisites, and thus we add it to the queue.\n\n## Step 6: If the total number of courses taken (which is the number of times we pop from the queue and successfully take a course) is equal to the total number of courses (5 in this case), we can finish all courses.
