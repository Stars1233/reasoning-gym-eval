We start with 844 divided by 128.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the division\n844 \u00f7 128 = 6 remainder 56. This means 844 = 128 * 6 + 56.\n\n## Step 4: Continue the Euclidean algorithm\nNext, we divide 128 by 56. 128 \u00f7 56 = 2 remainder 16. This means 128 = 56 * 2 + 16.\n\n## Step 5: Continue the algorithm further\nNow, divide 56 by 16. 56 \u00f7 16 = 3 remainder 8. This means 56 = 16 * 3 + 8.\n\n## Step 6: Continue once more\nNext, divide 16 by 8. 16 \u00f7 8 = 2 remainder 0. Since we have reached a remainder of 0, the divisor (8) is the GCD.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>8</answer>",
