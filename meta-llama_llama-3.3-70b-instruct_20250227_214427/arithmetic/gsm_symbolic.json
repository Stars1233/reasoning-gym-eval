So, the bottleneck in the process is sauteing the carrots.\n\nTo saute 180 carrots at a rate of 3.75 carrots per minute, it would take her 180 / 3.75 = 48 minutes.\n\nHowever, this calculation only accounts for the sauteing time and does not consider the peeling time, which is relatively faster. Since peeling and sauteing are sequential tasks, we should also calculate the peeling time for 180 carrots and add it to the sauteing time if necessary. But given that peeling is faster, the total time will be dictated by the sauteing.\n\nPeeling 180 carrots at 9 carrots per minute takes 180 / 9 = 20 minutes.\n\nSince sauteing dictates the overall time and peeling can be done concurrently with sauteing or beforehand without adding to the overall time due to its faster rate, the total time is essentially the time it takes to saute the carrots.\n\n<answer>48</answer>",
