Finally, add the results of the multiplication and subtraction together.\n\nLet's perform these operations:\n\n1. Multiplication: 0xbf4f * 0x6e6f = 0x3f6f * 0x6e6f (since 0xbf4f is a negative number in two's complement, we convert it to its negative decimal form for ease of calculation, but we'll keep it in hex for the operation) = -0x40 * 0x6e6f + 0x6e6f * 0xf = -0x2626f60 + 0x6e6f = -0x2625f91 (considering the actual calculation in two's complement or signed integer, the correct approach directly calculates the product of the two numbers as signed integers).\n\n2. Subtraction: 0xe39c - 0xa7c5 = 0x1b77.\n\n3. Now, add the results: The multiplication result needs to be correctly calculated considering the sign and magnitude:\n0xbf4f * 0x6e6f = -0x40 * 0x6e6f + 0x4f * 0x6e6f. However, the correct step involves understanding the signed multiplication:\n0xbf4f is -0x40 + 0x4f, but in two's complement, it's actually -0x40 (for the part that represents the negative sign in two's complement) plus 0x4f. The correct multiplication should consider the actual numerical values:\n0xbf4f = -16381 (in decimal), 0x6e6f = 28287 (in decimal), so -16381 * 28287 = -463083547.\n\nConverting -463083547 to hex: -0x1b7c5c7f.\n\nNow, adding the results of the subtraction to this product:\n-0x1b7c5c7f + 0x1b77.\n\nLet's correctly calculate the final sum:\n-0x1b7c5c7f + 0x1b77 = -0x1b7c5c7f + 0x1b77 = -0x1b7c4004.\n\n<answer>-0x1b7c4004</answer>",

Multiply 0x6f42 by 0xda47:\n   - 0x6f42 * 0xda47 = 0x447382294\n   \n2. Shift 0x5ff3 left by 0x2 (which is equivalent to multiplying by 2^2 or 4):\n   - 0x5ff3 << 0x2 = 0x5ff3 * 4 = 0x1ffc4\n\n3. Add the result of step 1 to the result of step 2:\n   - 0x447382294 + 0x1ffc4 = 0x447382494\n\nThe result of the given expression is:\n<answer>0x447382494</answer>",
