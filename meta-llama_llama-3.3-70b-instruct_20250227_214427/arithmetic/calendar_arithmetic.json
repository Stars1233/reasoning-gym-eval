Each week has 2 weekend days, so 14 weeks would have 14 * 2 = 28 weekend days.\n\n## Step 3: Adjust for partial weeks\nSince the period starts on a Thursday and ends on a Friday, we need to adjust for the partial weeks at the beginning and end. The first week (May 26 to May 29) includes 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday), and the last week (August 29 to September 2) includes 2 weekend days as well (Saturday and Sunday, August 27 and 28, and then only Friday, September 2, is counted). However, we've already accounted for full weeks, so we only need to consider if there are any additional weekend days not yet accounted for due to the start and end dates. Given the calculation of full weekend days within complete weeks, no additional adjustment is needed beyond subtracting the total weekend days from the total days.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate business days\nSubtract the total number of weekend days from the total number of days to find the number of business days. Total days = 99, weekend days = 28.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$",

      "full_model_response": "To determine if 2121 is a leap year, we follow these steps:\n1. A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.\n2. The year 2121 is not evenly divisible by 4 because 2121 divided by 4 leaves a remainder (2121 \u00f7 4 = 530.25).\n\nGiven these rules, since 2121 is not divisible by 4, it does not meet the criteria for a leap year.\n\n<answer>No</answer>",
