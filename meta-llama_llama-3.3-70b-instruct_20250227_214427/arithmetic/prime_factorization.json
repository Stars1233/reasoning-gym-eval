This means breaking down the number into its simplest building blocks, which are the prime numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Start by dividing 210 by the smallest prime number, which is 2\nDividing 210 by 2 gives us 105. This means 2 is a prime factor of 210.\n\n## Step 3: Continue the process with the quotient obtained, which is 105\nNow, we need to find the prime factors of 105. The smallest prime number that can divide 105 is 3. Dividing 105 by 3 gives us 35. So, 3 is also a prime factor of 210.\n\n## Step 4: Repeat the process with the new quotient, which is 35\nThe smallest prime number that can divide 35 is 5. Dividing 35 by 5 gives us 7. Both 5 and 7 are prime numbers, so they are prime factors of 210.\n\n## Step 5: Combine all the prime factors found\nWe have found that the prime factors of 210 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 6: Write the prime factorization in the required format\nSince we need to write the factors separated by \u00d7, the prime factorization of 210 is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7</answer>",

When we try dividing 87 by 3 and then moving to higher primes, we find that 3 does not work, but 87 divided by 3 gives a remainder, and when we reach 7 and 11 and then 13, none of these work directly as factors of 87 in a straightforward manner without leaving a remainder, except when combining them.\n\nHowever, when testing these primes, 87 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 directly without a remainder. Upon closer inspection or using trial division with primes, we notice:\n\n87 \u00f7 3 = 29\n\nBoth 3 and 29 are prime numbers. So, the prime factorization of 87 is:\n\n<answer>3 \u00d7 29</answer>",

We start by dividing 936 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we cannot divide anymore.\n\n## Step 2: Divide 936 by 2\nDividing 936 by 2 gives us 468. Since 468 is also divisible by 2, we continue.\n\n## Step 3: Continue dividing by 2\nDividing 468 by 2 gives us 234. Again, 234 is divisible by 2.\n\n## Step 4: Further division by 2\nDividing 234 by 2 gives us 117. Now, 117 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3.\n\n## Step 5: Divide by 3\nDividing 117 by 3 gives us 39. Since 39 is also divisible by 3, we continue.\n\n## Step 6: Continue dividing by 3\nDividing 39 by 3 gives us 13. Now, 13 is a prime number and cannot be divided further by any other prime numbers except for itself.\n\n## Step 7: Compile the prime factorization\nWe found that 936 can be divided by 2 three times (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2), then by 3 two times (3 \u00d7 3), and finally by 13. So, the prime factorization of 936 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13.\n\nThe final answer is: <answer>2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13</answer>",
