      "full_model_response": "## Step 1: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator\nTo simplify the fraction $13464/36504$, we first need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator (13464) and the denominator (36504).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the GCD\nWe can calculate the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm or by factorizing the numbers. Let's start by finding common factors.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize the numbers\nBoth 13464 and 36504 are divisible by 2, 3, and other common factors. Factoring them into prime factors will help us find the GCD.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the prime factorization of 13464 and 36504\nPrime factorization of 13464 is $2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 187$ (further simplifying 187 yields $11 \\times 17$), so $13464 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 11 \\times 17$. Prime factorization of 36504 is $2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 73$, so $36504 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 73$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify common prime factors to find the GCD\nThe common prime factors are $2^4$ and $3^2$. Thus, the GCD is $2^4 \\times 3^2 = 144$.\n\n## Step 6: Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCD\nTo simplify the fraction, divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD (144). So, $13464 / 144 = 93.5$ and $36504 / 144 = 253.5$, but since we need whole numbers for a simplified fraction, it seems there was a miscalculation in considering the result of the division as integers directly without considering the proper simplification of the fraction through factorization.\n\n## Step 7: Properly simplify the fraction\nSimplifying $13464/36504$ with the correct understanding that we divide both numerator and denominator by their GCD, which is 144, yields $13464/144 = 93.5$ and $36504/144 = 253.5$. This mistake indicates a misunderstanding in the simplification process, as we should simplify using the common factors directly: the GCD $2^4 \\times 3^2$ (or 144) indicates how much both can be divided by, but we look for the simplified form of the fraction, which involves canceling out common factors, not necessarily dividing both by the GCD in this step. We need to find the simplified form after correctly identifying the GCD's role in simplification.\n\n## Step 8: Correctly simplify the fraction using the GCD\nGiven the correct GCD of 144, the simplified form is actually found by dividing both the numerator and denominator by this GCD, but since the step of dividing was incorrectly applied as if seeking decimal results rather than simplifying the fraction, we should reconsider: the correct simplification involves factoring and canceling common factors from both the numerator and the denominator without turning them into decimals. The correct factorization shows that both numbers share $2^4 \\times 3^2$ as common factors. Simplifying the fraction means dividing both by these common factors: $(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 11 \\times 17) / (2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 73)$ simplifies to $(11 \\times 17) / (7 \\times 73)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11*17/7*73 = 187/511}$",

The prime factorization of 9387 is 3 * 3129, and further breaking down 3129 yields 3 * 1043. Since 1043 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 9387 is 3^2 * 1043. For 49644, the prime factorization is 2^2 * 3 * 4131, and breaking down 4131 yields 3 * 1377. Further breaking down 1377 gives 3 * 459, and breaking down 459 gives 3 * 153. Since 153 is 3 * 51, and 51 is 3 * 17, the prime factorization of 49644 is 2^2 * 3^4 * 17.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the common prime factors between the numerator and the denominator.\nFrom the prime factorizations, we see that both 9387 and 49644 share the prime factor 3.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the GCD using the common prime factors.\nThe GCD of 9387 and 49644, based on the shared prime factor 3, is 3.\n\n## Step 5: Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction.\nDivide 9387 by 3 to get 3129, and divide 49644 by 3 to get 16548. The simplified fraction is $\\frac{3129}{16548}$.\n\n## Step 6: Check if the fraction can be simplified further.\nWe need to check if 3129 and 16548 have any common factors other than 1. The prime factorization of 3129 is 3 * 1043, and for 16548, it is 2^2 * 3 * 1377. Since 1377 further breaks down into 3 * 459, and 459 into 3 * 153, and 153 into 3 * 51, and 51 into 3 * 17, the prime factorization of 16548 is 2^2 * 3^4 * 17. They share a factor of 3.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction further if possible.\nDividing both 3129 and 16548 by 3 gives $\\frac{1043}{5516}$.\n\n## Step 8: Check again for further simplification.\n1043 is a prime number, and 5516 breaks down into 2^2 * 1379. Since 1379 is a prime number, there are no more common factors besides 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1043}{5516}}$",

The numerator is 1978 and the denominator is 13915.\n\n## Step 2: Find the prime factors of the numerator and denominator\nBreaking down 1978 into its prime factors: 1978 = 2 * 989. Further breaking down 989, we find that 989 = 23 * 43. So, the prime factorization of 1978 is 2 * 23 * 43.\n\n## Step 3: Continue with the denominator\nBreaking down 13915 into its prime factors: 13915 = 5 * 2783. Further breaking down 2783, we find that 2783 = 23 * 121. Since 121 = 11^2, the prime factorization of 13915 is 5 * 11^2 * 23.\n\n## Step 4: Identify common factors\nBoth the numerator and denominator share a common prime factor, which is 23.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction\nTo simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 23. So, the simplified fraction becomes (2 * 23 * 43) / (5 * 11^2 * 23) = (2 * 43) / (5 * 11^2).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final simplified fraction\nThe simplified fraction is 86 / 605.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{86}{605}}$",
