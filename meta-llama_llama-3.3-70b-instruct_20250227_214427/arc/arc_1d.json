      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the provided examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: The first step is to look for any obvious patterns or transformations from the input to the output. At first glance, the outputs seem to be a simplified or modified version of the inputs, but the exact rule isn't immediately clear.\n\n2. **Comparing Inputs and Outputs**: \n   - In Example 1, the input contains a mix of 0s, 1s, and 2s, and the output seems to replace most of the numbers with 2s and 0s in a specific pattern.\n   - In Example 2, a similar transformation occurs, but the details of how 0s, 1s, and 2s are transformed into the output pattern are not straightforward.\n   - In Example 3, despite the input having a different arrangement of 0s, 1s, and 2s, the output again follows a pattern that seems to simplify or modify the input in a consistent way.\n\n3. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - Upon closer inspection, it seems that the outputs are not directly related to the specific values of the inputs (0, 1, or 2) but rather to their positions or the presence of certain numbers.\n   - A key observation is that in each example, the output grid starts with a sequence of 2s followed by a sequence of 0s, and then ends with a sequence of 1s. This suggests that the rule might not depend on the exact values in the input but rather on the structure or the count of certain elements.\n\n4. **Deriving the Specific Rule**:\n   - Looking at the transitions from input to output, it appears that the rule could involve replacing certain elements with others based on their counts or positions rather than their values.\n   - However, a simpler and more consistent rule that fits all examples provided is that the output grid consists of a sequence of 2s, followed by a sequence of 0s, and then a sequence of 1s. The length of each sequence seems to be consistent across the examples, with the sequence of 2s and 0s covering the first part of the output and the 1s covering the last part.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - Given the test input: 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0\n   - The rule derived suggests that the output should start with a sequence of 2s, followed by a sequence of 0s, and end with a sequence of 1s. The exact lengths of these sequences in the provided examples are consistent (7 twos, 8 zeros, and 8 ones in the examples given), suggesting a structural rather than value-based transformation.\n\nGiven the analysis, if we apply the observed pattern to the test input, where the first part of the output is filled with 2s, the middle part with 0s, and the last part with 1s, and assuming the sequence lengths are fixed as observed in the examples (which might not directly apply due to the variable nature of the inputs), we still need to determine the sequence lengths for our specific test case. Since the examples all have 23 elements and the outputs follow a specific sequence length pattern, we'll apply a similar division for our test case, which also has 23 elements.\n\n<output>2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</output>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: In Example 1, the input grid has a sequence of two 4s, which in the output grid, are moved to the beginning of the sequence, replacing the initial zeros. A similar pattern is observed in the other examples; the non-zero numbers are shifted to the left (towards the beginning of the grid) as much as possible without changing their count or sequence.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: The rule seems to be that all non-zero numbers in the input grid are moved to the leftmost positions in the output grid, maintaining their order and quantity. Zeros are then filled in the remaining spaces to the right of these non-zero numbers. This is evident in all examples: \n   - In Example 1, two 4s move to the front.\n   - In Example 2, the sequence of 9s moves to the front, shifted two positions to the left.\n   - In Example 3, two 2s move to the front, shifting two positions to the left from their original positions.\n\n3. **Applying the Rule**: Given this understanding, let's apply the rule to the test input grid: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`.\n\nFollowing the rule, all the 1s should move to the front, filling the grid from left to right with these non-zero values, and then the rest should be zeros.\n\nThus, applying the rule to the test input grid, we would get all the 1s shifted to the beginning of the grid, followed by zeros.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<output>1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

This includes examining the positions of the numbers, their values, and how they change from the input to the output.\n\n2. **Examining Boundaries**: Notice that in each example, the output grid seems to maintain the same numbers as the input grid except for certain positions. Specifically, it appears that the rule might involve the first and last occurrences of non-zero numbers and how they are treated.\n\n3. **Focusing on Non-Zero to Zero Transitions**: In Example 1, the input starts with zeros, followed by a 2, then zeros, and then a sequence of 7s. The output changes the last sequence of 7s by adding a zero at the end but keeps the sequence intact otherwise. A similar observation can be made for Example 2, where the sequence of 6s is maintained but ends with a zero in the output.\n\n4. **Understanding the Role of Zeros**: Zeros at the beginning of the sequence seem to be preserved as is. However, when a non-zero number is encountered, it and all subsequent non-zero numbers of the same value seem to be retained, but the sequence ends with a zero if it's not already at the end of the grid.\n\n5. **Deriving the Rule**: From the observations, the rule appears to be as follows:\n   - Start scanning the input grid from left to right.\n   - If the grid starts with zeros, these zeros are preserved in the output.\n   - Once a non-zero number is encountered, this number and any subsequent occurrences of the same number are kept in the output.\n   - The sequence of non-zero numbers is allowed to continue until a different non-zero number is encountered or the end of the grid is reached.\n   - If the grid ends with a sequence of the same non-zero number, this sequence is preserved in the output but is followed by a zero, unless the grid already ends with a zero.\n\n6. **Application to Test Input**: Given the test input grid \"9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\", let's apply the derived rule:\n   - The input starts with a sequence of 9s, which will be preserved.\n   - This sequence of 9s is followed by zeros, which are also preserved as they are.\n   - The input ends with a 2. According to the rule, since this is a new non-zero number, it should be preserved but since it's at the end and not part of a longer sequence that needs a trailing zero (because it's already followed by its own 'sequence' being singular and then the grid ends), it remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, applying the rule to the test input \"9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\", we get the output grid:\n\n<output>9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0</output>",

However, sequences that are bounded by zeros on both ends, like in Example 3, simply shift to the left without shortening.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's apply the rule to the test input grid:\n- Input: `0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0`\n\nApplying the observed rule, the sequence of `1`s is bounded by a `0` on the left and will shift one position to the left, but since it ends before the end of the grid (followed by `0`s), it should maintain its length but will be truncated at the end due to reaching the grid's boundary. Thus, the output should be:\n- Output: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0`\n\nHowever, carefully re-examining the rule based on the provided examples, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the handling of sequence ends. The correct interpretation seems to be that the sequence shifts one position to the left and, if extending to the end, will also be truncated by one at the end. \n\nTherefore, with the corrected understanding applied to the test input:\n- The sequence of `1`s shifts one position to the left, starting from the second position instead of the second, and since it originally ends at the 16th position before the trailing zeros, it should now start at the first position and end at the 15th position, effectively being `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`.\n\nThis corrected interpretation aligns with the examples provided where sequences not only shift to the left but also get truncated if they were originally bounded by a zero at the end.\n\nThus, the corrected output for the given input is:\n\n<output>1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

In all examples, the output seems to retain the same structure as the input in terms of the placement of zeros, but the values of 2 are sometimes replaced with 8.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it appears that the rule involves replacing certain instances of 2 with 8. To understand when a 2 is replaced with 8, let's examine the positions and patterns more closely.\n\n3. **Analyzing Example 1**: In the first example, the input starts with five 2s followed by three 0s, then seven 2s, and ends with three 0s. The output starts with two 8s followed by three 2s, then three 0s, two 8s, three 8s, three 2s, and ends with three 0s. This suggests that the first and last occurrences of a sequence of 2s (before encountering a 0 or the end of the sequence) are replaced with 8s.\n\n4. **Verifying with Other Examples**: \n   - **Example 2**: The input has a single 0, followed by three 2s, three 0s, five 2s, and ends with seven 0s. The output replaces the first 2 after the single 0 and the last two 2s before the sequence of 0s with 8s, supporting the observed rule.\n   - **Example 3**: The input starts with three 0s, followed by three 2s, three 0s, and ends with six 2s. The output changes the first 2 after the initial 0s and the first three 2s after the second set of 0s to 8s, consistent with the rule.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input \"2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", let's apply the rule. The input starts with five 2s (replace the first and last with 8s), followed by two 0s, then three 2s (replace the first with 8 since it's after 0s and the start of a new sequence of 2s), and ends with seven 0s.\n\nBased on this analysis, the predicted output should replace the first and last 2 in sequences (before hitting a 0 or the end of the input) with 8s. Thus, the first sequence of five 2s should start with an 8 and end with an 8 (8 2 2 2 8), the next sequence of three 2s should start with an 8 (8 2 2), and the rest remains the same.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<output>8 2 2 2 8 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: The first step is to observe any patterns or regularities in how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. Looking at the examples, there doesn't seem to be a straightforward arithmetic operation (like addition or multiplication) applied to each element. The transformation seems more complex.\n\n2. **Element-wise Transformation**: Let's check if there's a pattern in how each element in the input grid is transformed. In Example 1, the input starts with \"0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1\" and the output is \"2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\". One possible approach is to see if the position of elements or their values correlates with the output.\n\n3. **Focusing on Specific Values**: Let's focus on the transformation of specific values. For instance, looking at the zeros and ones:\n   - In Example 1, \"0\" appears in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and the corresponding output positions have values, but there's no direct one-to-one correspondence that applies across all examples.\n   - Similarly, looking at \"1\" and \"2\", there's no simple replacement rule that applies universally.\n\n4. **Considering the Rule Involves Counts or Positions**: Given that direct element-wise transformation doesn't yield a clear pattern, the next step is to consider if the rule involves counting occurrences of certain numbers or their positions. \n\n5. **Analyzing Example 1**: The output \"2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\" suggests that the rule could involve some form of aggregation or counting. Specifically, the number of \"2\"s, \"1\"s, and \"0\"s in the input and their distribution might play a role.\n\n6. **Hypothesis**: A possible hypothesis is that the output grid is constructed based on the counts of each digit in the input grid. Specifically, the rule could involve placing a certain number of \"2\"s, followed by \"0\"s, and then \"1\"s in the output, based on their counts in the input.\n\n7. **Testing the Hypothesis**: Let's apply this hypothesis to Example 1:\n   - Input: \"0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1\"\n   - Counts: 5 \"0\"s, 3 \"1\"s, 2 \"2\"s\n   - If the rule is to place \"2\"s first, then \"0\"s, then \"1\"s, the output could indeed start with \"2\"s (since there are 2 of them), followed by \"0\"s (since there are 5 of them but the output pattern suggests fewer \"0\"s are placed before the \"1\"s, indicating a possible misinterpretation in the direct count-to-output positioning), and finally \"1\"s.\n\n8. **Refining the Hypothesis**: Given the outputs, it seems the rule could be more about the presence and count of \"2\"s and \"1\"s, potentially ignoring the \"0\"s for the initial part of the output or considering their positions differently. The \"2\"s appear at the start of each output, followed by \"0\"s, and then \"1\"s. The exact count and positioning need further refinement.\n\n9. **Application to Other Examples**: Applying a similar analysis to Examples 2 and 3:\n   - Example 2 Input: \"1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n   - Example 3 Input: \"1 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0\"\n   - Their outputs suggest that \"2\"s are placed first, but the number of \"0\"s and \"1\"s and their positioning in the output don't directly correlate with their counts in a straightforward manner. This indicates the rule might involve a more complex logic, possibly related to the sequence or pattern of numbers rather than just their counts.\n\n10. **Re-evaluating the Rule**: Given the complexity and the fact that the outputs start with \"2\"s, have \"0\"s, and end with \"1\"s, it seems the rule might involve a sequence or pattern recognition that prioritizes the placement of \"2\"s, then possibly clears or sets \"0\"s based on some condition, and finally places \"1\"s. However, the provided examples don't clearly support a simple count-based rule for the exact positioning of \"0\"s and \"1\"s after the \"2\"s.\n\nGiven the analysis, let's apply a potential rule to the test input: \"0 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2\"\n- Count of \"2\"s: 2\n- Count of \"1\"s: 4\n- Count of \"0\"s: 5\n\nIf we follow a hypothetical rule where \"2\"s are placed first, then \"0\"s, and finally \"1\"s, based on their presence and potentially their counts or positions, the output might reflect the counts or sequences of these numbers. However, the exact rule from the provided examples isn't crystal clear, suggesting a potential misunderstanding in the direct application of counts or sequences.\n\nGiven the outputs provided in the examples and attempting to follow a logical sequence that starts with \"2\"s, followed by a pattern that could involve \"0\"s and ends with \"1\"s, the prediction for the output of the test input \"0 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2\" could be based on the observed patterns in the examples, but the precise rule remains elusive based on the given analysis.\n\n<output>2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1</output>",

Specifically, the first occurrence of '8' in the input is shifted to the right by the number of zeros preceding it, and the trailing zeros are preserved at the end.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis**:\n   - Input:  6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Observation: Here, the single '0' in the input seems to be moved to the left by the number of '6's preceding it. However, considering the pattern from Example 1, it seems more about the positioning of the first different element (in this case, '0') rather than a simple shift based on preceding elements.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis**:\n   - Input:  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   - Output: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   - Observation: When the input is uniform, the output remains the same. This suggests that the rule might only apply when there's a change in the pattern (i.e., from one number to another).\n\nConsidering these observations, the rule seems to involve shifting the first occurrence of a different element (from the start) to the right by the number of elements preceding it that are the same as the first element, but this doesn't fully explain Example 2. A simpler, unified rule could be:\n\n- The rule involves finding the first element that differs from the first element of the sequence and moving it to the fifth position if it's the first different element encountered from the left.\n\nHowever, this doesn't perfectly align with the examples given, especially when considering the movement of patterns and the preservation of trailing elements. Let's refine the understanding:\n\nUpon reevaluation, a more consistent rule seems to be related to the positioning of the first different element in the sequence:\n\n- If the sequence starts with a repeated number and then changes, the first different number (or the change point) is moved to the fifth position in the output sequence.\n\nGiven this refined rule, let's apply it to the test input:\n\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe first different element from the start is '6', which appears at the 17th position. According to the observed rule, this '6' should be moved to the fifth position. However, the rule as stated doesn't perfectly capture the behavior seen in the examples, particularly regarding how the rest of the sequence is handled after the first different element is moved.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies in deriving a precise rule from the examples and the potential for misinterpretation, let's directly apply the most straightforward observation that could fit all examples, focusing on the movement of the first different element to the fifth position and preserving the rest of the pattern as closely as possible:\n\nIf we move the first '6' (the different element) to the fifth position and preserve the rest of the sequence's integrity as much as possible, the output could look like the first different element ('6') being placed in the fifth position, followed by the rest of the elements in their original order after the shift.\n\nThus, the predicted output, following the movement of the first different element to the fifth position and maintaining the sequence's integrity, would be:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<output>0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

This could imply a rule where the leading sequence (before the zeros) is extended to fill the gap before the next sequence of 8s starts.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis**:\n   - Input:  4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n   - Output: 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n   - Observations: Similar to Example 1, the leading sequence (4 4 4 4) is extended by two more 4s before the sequence of zeros, which again seems to fill a gap before the main body of 4s.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis**:\n   - Input:  7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - Output: 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - Observations: The single leading 7 is extended to three 7s (7 7 7) before the zeros, and then the remainder of the output is filled with the pattern from the input, but with the sequence of zeros extended to fill the gap before the main sequence of 7s starts.\n\nBased on these observations, the common rule appears to be:\n- **Identify the leading sequence** (the sequence of non-zero numbers at the beginning of the input).\n- **Extend this sequence** to fill the gap between the leading sequence and the main body of the input (if the input starts with zeros, consider the first non-zero sequence as the leading sequence).\n- **Preserve the sequence of zeros** as it appears in the input but adjust its position based on the extension of the leading sequence.\n\nGiven this rule, let's apply it to the test input grid:\nInput: 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\nApplying the rule:\n- The leading sequence is \"4 4 4 4 4 4\".\n- We extend this sequence to fill the gap. Since the next sequence after the zeros is a single 4, we need to consider how the rule applies in a scenario where the pattern isn't as straightforward as the examples.\n- Given the examples, the extension seems to be about ensuring continuity of the leading number sequence before the zeros, and then the zeros act as a filler before the next sequence of numbers.\n- So, the output, following the observed pattern, should extend the leading 4s sequence, followed by the zeros (which seem to act as a buffer), and then the solo 4 at the end, but applying the rule strictly as observed, we should have the leading sequence, then the buffer of zeros, and ensure the rest of the numbers follow the established pattern.\n\nHowever, directly applying the observed rule to this specific test case might not yield a straightforward answer without assuming the rule's behavior in edge cases or slightly different patterns. But, considering the pattern of extension and preservation of sequences:\n- The leading sequence of 4s is extended.\n- The zeros are preserved and seem to act as a divider.\n- The trailing solo 4 suggests a continuation but given the provided examples, it's about extending the leading sequence and then maintaining the rest of the pattern.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need to adhere strictly to the provided examples for a precise rule, the application to the test case might slightly differ based on interpretation. But, following the general observation of extending the leading sequence and then the pattern of zeros and numbers, a possible interpretation could be extending the 4s, keeping the zeros, and ensuring the rest follows suit, but the exact match to the rule as described in the examples would suggest an output where the leading sequence is prominent, followed by the buffer of zeros, and then the continuation of the pattern.\n\nGiven the test case and the observed rule, if we were to predict the output based on the extension and preservation pattern, ensuring we're not over-specifying beyond the examples provided:\n\n<output>4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4</output>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: Looking at the examples provided, we notice that the input and output grids consist of sequences of the same number (either 0 or a non-zero number) that seem to shift or change in some pattern. The change isn't random; it follows a specific rule that we need to identify.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: \n   - In Example 1, the sequence of zeros at the beginning stays the same, but the sequence of 4s shifts two positions to the left, and two of the zeros at the end become 4s. However, observing this example closely, we see that the 4s essentially wrap around and replace two of the zeros that are at the boundary between the zeros and the 4s.\n   - In Example 2, the input has a 0 in the middle of a sequence of 6s. The output sequence keeps this 0 but moves it two positions to the left, effectively replacing two of the 6s with the 0.\n   - In Example 3, there's a block of zeros in the middle of a sequence of 8s. The output shows this block of zeros expanded by two positions to the left, replacing two of the 8s at the start of the block of 8s preceding the zeros.\n\n3. **Common Rule Identification**:\n   - From the analysis, it seems the rule involves moving or expanding a block of numbers into the adjacent block of different numbers. However, the exact mechanism isn't immediately clear from the initial observations. Let's refine our understanding:\n     - Upon closer inspection, we notice that in each case, the transition from one number to another (e.g., from 0 to a non-zero number) shifts or moves. Specifically, for any block of non-zero numbers followed by zeros, the non-zero numbers seem to move into the zeros, and for any block of zeros within non-zero numbers, the zeros seem to move into the non-zero numbers. This is a bit misleading because it simplifies to a basic observation that there's a shift or replacement at the boundary between different numbers.\n\n4. **Refined Understanding**:\n   - The actual rule appears to be simpler than initially thought. Looking at the transitions between different numbers:\n     - Example 1: The block of 4s moves into the block of zeros.\n     - Example 2: The single 0 moves into the block of 6s.\n     - Example 3: The block of zeros moves into the block of 8s.\n   - It seems the rule involves shifting the block or the boundary between two different types of numbers. However, the description was misleading because the actual transformation is more straightforward: The first occurrence of a non-zero number or zero from the left shifts two positions to the left.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - Given the input: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n   - The first non-zero (2) doesn't need to shift since it's already at the start.\n   - The first zero is at the 8th position. If we apply the observed rule (shifting the boundary or the first occurrence of a different number two positions to the left), we would shift the 0s into the 2s or vice versa. However, re-evaluating the rule based on the correction:\n     - The actual transformation seems to involve moving the first different element (either a zero moving into non-zeros or vice versa) two positions to the left. Thus, applying this to our test case, the first zero (which is the first different element from the sequence of 2s) would move two positions to the left, resulting in the output: 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nGiven this corrected understanding of the rule, let's apply it to predict the output grid for the test input.\n\n<output>2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</output>",

However, the exact nature of this rotation isn't immediately clear from the initial observation.\n\nLet's re-examine the transformation more closely:\n\n1. Example 1: The input starts with \"1 1\", and the output also starts with \"1\", but the second \"1\" in the input is replaced by \"5\" in the output, which is the next element in the input sequence. The last element of the input \"8\" moves to the last position of the output.\n2. Example 2: Similarly, \"9\" is replaced by \"3\" (the next element), and \"2\" (the last element) moves to the end.\n3. Example 3: \"8\" is replaced by \"2\" (the next element), and \"5\" (the last element) moves to the end.\n\nIt seems the rule involves moving the first element to the end and shifting the rest of the elements one position to the left.

At first glance, the transformation doesn't seem to follow a simple arithmetic operation or a direct mapping based on the position of the elements.\n\n2. **Element-wise Comparison**: Comparing each element in the input grid with its corresponding element in the output grid doesn't reveal a straightforward rule, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, that applies uniformly across all examples.\n\n3. **Looking for Dominance or Priority**: Let's examine if there's a dominance or priority rule where certain numbers influence the output more than others. Specifically, looking at the outputs, it seems that the number 1 tends to dominate or spread in the output grids, often replacing other numbers.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Spread of Numbers**: Observing the outputs more closely, it appears that the number 1 spreads to fill the first part of the grid, and the number 2 fills the last part. The transition from 1s to 2s (or 0s to 2s in some cases) seems to happen around the middle or a specific point in the grid.\n\n5. **Identifying the Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it seems the rule might involve replacing all numbers before a certain point with 1 (if there are any 1s in the first half of the input) and all numbers after that point with 2 (if there are any 2s in the second half of the input), with 0s being replaced by the dominant number in their respective half. However, this is a bit complex and might not fully capture the transformation.\n\n6. **Simplifying the Rule**: A simpler way to look at it might be to consider the grid as being divided into two parts: the first part where 1 dominates (and potentially 0s are converted to 1s if 1 is present), and the second part where 2 dominates (with 0s and potentially 1s being converted to 2s if 2 is present). The exact point of division isn't immediately clear but seems related to the distribution of 1s and 2s.\n\n7. **Testing the Rule**: Applying this simplified rule to the examples:\n    - Example 1: The input has 1s in the first half and 2s in the second half, which matches the output where 1s fill the first part and 2s fill the last part.\n    - Example 2 and 3: Similar logic applies, where the presence of 1s and 2s in different halves influences the output.\n\n8. **Applying to Test Input**: For the test input \"1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\", let's apply the observed rule. The first half of the grid contains 1s, and the second half contains 2s. Thus, we would expect 1s to dominate the first part of the output and 2s the second part.\n\nGiven the input \"1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\", applying the rule that the first half of the grid is dominated by 1 (replacing 0s) and the second half by 2 (replacing 0s and potentially 1s), we can predict the output.\n\n<output>1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2</output>",

In all examples, the number 2 is sometimes changed to 8, but not always. This suggests that the rule might depend on the position or the neighboring values of the number 2.\n\n2. **Analyzing Changes**: Let's analyze where the changes from 2 to 8 occur. In Example 1, the first two 2s are changed to 8s, and the same happens in other instances where two consecutive 2s appear at the start of a sequence of 2s. However, if a single 2 or a sequence of more than two 2s is not at the beginning of a sequence of 2s, it doesn't change.\n\n3. **Rule Hypothesis**: Based on the observation, a possible rule could be that if a 2 is at the beginning of a sequence of 2s (and it's not alone or part of a sequence that starts with more than two 2s), it changes to 8. Otherwise, it remains 2. This seems to apply to all examples given.\n\n4. **Applying the Rule**: To confirm the rule, let's apply it to the examples and see if we can reproduce the output grids:\n   - Example 1: The sequences of 2s are \"2222\" and \"2222\". Applying the rule, the first two 2s in each sequence change to 8, resulting in \"8822\" and \"8822\", which matches the output.\n   - Example 2: The sequences are \"22\" and \"2222\". The first sequence changes to \"82\", and the second sequence to \"8822\", matching the output.\n   - Example 3: The sequences are \"22222\" and \"22\". The first sequence changes to \"88222\", and the second sequence to \"82\", which matches the output.\n\n5. **Testing the Rule with the Test Input**: Now, let's apply this rule to the given test input: \"0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\".\n   - The first sequence of 2s is \"222222\", which should change to \"882222\" according to our rule.\n   - The second sequence of 2s is \"222\", which should change to \"822\".\n\nSo, applying the rule to the test input, we get: \"0 0 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 2 2\".\n\nThe final answer is: \n<output>0 0 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 2 2</output>",

The non-zero elements maintain their original order relative to each other.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\nGiven the input grid: 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0\n\n1. Identify non-zero elements and their positions: (6, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (2, 4), (6, 5), (9, 6), (8, 7), (1, 8), (7, 9)\n2. Count zeros to the left of the first non-zero element: 0 zeros\n3. Since there are no zeros to the left of the first non-zero element (6), we do not shift it based on zeros. However, following the observed pattern, we need to consider how the rule applies to shifting based on the arrangement of non-zero and zero elements.\n\nGiven the misunderstanding in the initial derivation regarding the shift based on zeros to the left, let's correct the approach by directly applying the observed pattern from the examples:\n\n- The pattern shows that non-zero elements are moved to the right and wrapped around, with their order preserved. In Example 1, elements (5, 6, 3, 9) move from the right to the left. In Example 2, (1, 5, 3) moves rightwards and wraps around. In Example 3, (8, 8) moves two positions to the right.\n\nConsidering this correction and directly observing the pattern without overcomplicating the rule:\n\n- For the input: 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0, following the pattern where non-zero elements seem to shift rightwards and wrap around, preserving their order:\n\nThe non-zero elements are 6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7. If we consider the rightmost non-zero elements and how they might shift based on the examples provided, there seems to be a misunderstanding in directly applying a simple shift rule based on the initial analysis.\n\n**Correct Approach**:\nUpon reevaluation, it seems the task requires identifying a pattern that isn't as straightforward as initially described. Given the examples, a correct interpretation involves recognizing that the non-zero numbers move to the beginning of the string, maintaining their order, and the rest of the string is filled with zeros.\n\nThus, the correct output, following the reinterpreted rule based on maintaining the order of non-zero elements and shifting them to the beginning, should directly reflect this pattern.\n\n<output>6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0</output>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the provided examples step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid Structure**: Each example is presented as a sequence of numbers that can be visualized as a 3x3 grid when the sequence is divided into rows of three elements each. For instance, the first example's input grid can be visualized as:\n   ```\n   4 4 4\n   0 0 4\n   0 0 0\n   ```\n   And its output grid as:\n   ```\n   4 4 4\n   0 4 4\n   4 4 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Identifying Patterns**: Looking at the transformation from the input to the output in each example, we can observe the following patterns:\n   - **Example 1**:\n     - Input: \n       ```\n       4 4 4\n       0 0 4\n       0 0 0\n       ```\n     - Output: \n       ```\n       4 4 4\n       0 4 4\n       4 4 4\n       ```\n     - The non-zero value (4) seems to be propagating or filling in the grid from the top and possibly spreading downwards or filling in empty spaces.\n   - **Example 2** and **Example 3** show similar patterns, but with different non-zero values (9 and 5, respectively).\n\n3. **Deriving the Rule**: From the examples, the rule appears to involve filling in the grid with the non-zero value from the top row into the empty spaces below it in a way that seems to prioritize filling rows or ensuring that every row has at least one instance of the non-zero value if possible. However, upon closer inspection, the pattern suggests that the non-zero value is filling in a way that completes a solid block or shape starting from the top row. This isn't entirely accurate as the rule seems more related to ensuring the presence of the non-zero value in each row, in a pattern that expands the influence of the top row's non-zero values downwards.\n\n4. **Revisiting the Examples for Clarity**: \n   - The description provided earlier might be misleading because it suggests a pattern that isn't fully consistent across the examples given. Upon re-examination, a simpler, more consistent rule might be at play:\n     - **Rule**: The output grid is derived by taking the first row of the input grid and using its non-zero value to fill in the first column of the output grid, ensuring each row has at least one instance of this non-zero value. This seems to be supported when looking at how the outputs are generated from the inputs in a way that prioritizes the non-zero value's presence in a structured manner.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   Given the test input grid:\n   ```\n   2 2 2\n   2 0 0\n   0 0 2\n   ```\n   Applying the observed rule, we prioritize filling the grid with the non-zero value (2) from the top row in such a way that each row contains this value, focusing on the column-wise distribution based on the top row's influence:\n   - The output, following the pattern where the first column is filled with the non-zero value from the top row (ensuring each row has this value), would look like this:\n     ```\n     2 2 2\n     2 0 0\n     2 0 2\n     ```\n   However, considering the rule might be more about ensuring the presence of the non-zero value in a manner consistent across examples and focusing on the initial analysis might have led to an incorrect interpretation. The examples actually suggest a simpler transformation where the input grid's non-zero values are used to fill in the output in a specific pattern, which seems to ensure that each row has the non-zero value if it's present in the input grid's corresponding row or column, particularly influenced by the top row's values.\n\nThe final interpretation seems to be off due to an overcomplication of the pattern. Given the initial examples and the aim for a consistent rule, the actual rule appears to simplify to ensuring the non-zero value from the top row fills the first column or is reflected in each row in a manner consistent with the examples provided, which might not directly apply as previously described.\n\nGiven the initial sequence and aiming for a correction in understanding the rule based on the provided examples:\n- The test input grid is:\n  ```\n  2 2 2\n  2 0 0\n  0 0 2\n  ```\n- The correct application of the observed pattern, considering the top row's influence and the need for the non-zero value to be present in a structured manner in each row, suggests that the grid should transform in a way that ensures this presence, potentially filling rows or columns based on the initial values.\n\nGiven the misinterpretation in the explanation process, let's correct and simplify the understanding of the rule based on the observed transformations:\n- The rule seems to involve filling the grid such that the non-zero value is propagated or ensured in each row, reflecting the top row's influence. However, the direct application of this rule was not clearly defined in the initial analysis.\n\nFor the given test input, applying the simplified understanding that the non-zero values should be reflected in a structured manner:\n```\n2 2 2\n2 0 0\n0 0 2\n```\nShould transform into an output where the non-zero value (2) is present in each row, considering the top row's pattern and its influence down the grid.\n\n<output>2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2</output>",

In Example 1, the input starts with a series of zeros, followed by a series of eights, and ends with zeros. The output shifts the series of eights two positions to the left. Similarly, in Example 2, the series of nines is shifted two positions to the left. Example 3 shows a series of eights that is also shifted two positions to the left but remains within its original bounds due to the surrounding zeros.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: From the observations, it seems the rule involves shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers two positions to the left. However, this shift is bounded by the edges of the grid and the presence of zeros. If shifting the non-zero sequence two positions to the left would move it beyond the grid's boundaries or into a position that was not originally part of the sequence, it appears to be truncated or stopped at the boundary.\n\n3. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**: Given the test input `0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`, applying the identified rule would involve shifting the sequence of nines two positions to the left. The sequence of nines is `9 9 9 9 9 9`, which starts at the 7th position and ends at the 12th position in the input grid.\n\n4. **Predicting the Output**: Shifting this sequence two positions to the left would ideally result in it starting at the 5th position. However, since the sequence cannot extend beyond the boundaries of the grid or into positions that were not part of the original sequence, we shift it as far as possible within these constraints. Thus, the sequence of nines would start at the 5th position and end at the 10th position, resulting in the output grid.\n\nThe final answer is: \n<output>0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

In all examples, the input grid contains sequences of the same number (either 7 or 4), and these sequences are flanked by zeros.\n\n2. **Analyzing Example 1**:\n   - Input: 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 7s in the input starts from the 4th position and ends at the 10th position. In the output, this sequence starts from the 2nd position and ends at the 8th position, effectively shifting the entire sequence one position to the left and truncating it by two positions from the right.\n\n3. **Analyzing Example 2**:\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: Here, the sequence of 7s starts from the 5th position and ends at the 9th position in the input. In the output, it starts from the 3rd position and ends at the 7th position, which is again a shift to the left by two positions and a truncation by two positions from the right.\n\n4. **Analyzing Example 3**:\n   - Input: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n   - Output: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 4s starts from the 4th position and ends at the 11th position in the input. In the output, it starts from the 2nd position and ends at the 9th position, showing a similar leftward shift and rightward truncation.\n\n5. **Generalizing the Rule**: Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:\n   - Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n   - Shift this sequence one position to the left.\n   - Truncate the sequence by two positions from the right.\n\n6. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - Input: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - The sequence of non-zero numbers is \"3\", starting and ending at the 3rd position.\n   - Applying the shift: Since there's only one \"3\", shifting it to the left would place it at the 2nd position.\n   - Applying the truncation: There's nothing to truncate since the sequence is just one element.\n\nTherefore, following the derived rule, the predicted output grid for the given test input should reflect the shifted and truncated sequence of non-zero numbers, which in this case is simply shifting the single \"3\" one position to the left.\n\n<output>0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

It's noticeable that the input grids are composed of sequences of the same number, and these sequences are separated by zeros.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it appears that whenever there is a sequence of the same non-zero number in the input grid, the corresponding output grid replaces all but the first occurrence of this number with a '1' within that sequence, until the sequence ends (i.e., until a zero or another number is encountered). The zeros in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n3. **Applying the Rule to Examples**:\n   - **Example 1**: The input sequence \"2 2 2 2 2 2\" becomes \"1 1 1 1 1 1\" in the output because all but the first '2' are replaced with '1'. However, this initial observation seems to have been misinterpreted. Correctly, the sequence \"2 2 2 2 2 2\" remains unchanged in all examples, suggesting the rule might be simpler: any sequence of the same non-zero number that is followed by a zero and then the number again, or starts the grid, remains unchanged. However, sequences that continue without interruption and are not at the start might be replaced by '1's after the first occurrence, but this doesn't hold across all examples provided. \n   - **Example 2 & 3**: Upon reevaluation, the rule seems to consistently apply as follows: The first occurrence of any non-zero number in a sequence remains unchanged, but if the sequence of the same number continues (without being interrupted by a zero or another number), the rest of the numbers in that sequence are replaced by '1's. However, the correct interpretation from the examples is that the first sequence of non-zero numbers remains as is, but if the same number appears later in a different sequence, it's replaced by '1's, indicating a potential misunderstanding in the initial rule formulation.\n\n4. **Reevaluating the Rule**:\n   - The correct rule seems to be: The first sequence of any non-zero number remains unchanged. If the same number appears later (after a zero), all instances of this number in the new sequence are replaced with '1's.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - The test input grid is \"0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\".\n   - The first sequence of '9's (\"9 9 9 9\") remains unchanged.\n   - The second sequence of '9's (\"9 9 9 9 9 9\") should have all its '9's replaced with '1's because it's a continuation of '9' after a zero, following the observed pattern.\n   - The third sequence of '9's (\"9 9 9 9\") should also have all its '9's replaced with '1's for the same reason.\n\nGiven the corrected understanding of the rule, the output grid should be:\n\"0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\".\n\n<output>0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0</output>",

Let's test this hypothesis by sorting the input grids from the examples and comparing them with the output grids.\n\n3. **Testing the Hypothesis**:\n    - **Example 1 Input Sorted**: Sorting the input grid from Example 1 yields a sequence of 0s followed by 1s and then 2s. Specifically, there are 11 zeros, 12 ones, and 3 twos. The output grid has all zeros first, followed by a sequence of ones, and then twos, which aligns with the sorted version of the input.\n    - **Example 2 Input Sorted**: Similarly, sorting the input from Example 2 results in a sequence that starts with zeros, followed by ones, and ends with twos. The counts are 12 zeros, 6 ones, and 8 twos. The output reflects this sorted arrangement.\n    - **Example 3 Input Sorted**: For Example 3, after sorting, we get a sequence that begins with zeros, followed by ones, and then twos, with counts of 13 zeros, 6 ones, and 7 twos.

In Example 1, the input starts with a series of zeros, followed by a series of sixes, and ends with zeros. The output, however, has a more distributed pattern of sixes, starting earlier and ending later than in the input, with the zeros being more confined to the ends.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it appears that the rule might involve shifting or spreading out the non-zero values (sixes in the examples) towards the edges while maintaining or adjusting the zero values accordingly. \n\n3. **Analyzing Example 1**: The input in Example 1 has a block of sixes starting from the 5th position to the 27th position. In the output, this block seems to expand, starting from the 2nd position and ending at the 26th position, effectively moving the start of the block earlier and the end of the block slightly earlier as well, but mostly it seems to fill in the gaps at the beginning and end with sixes.\n\n4. **Considering Example 2 and 3**: These examples further reinforce the idea that the non-zero block (of sixes) is being shifted or expanded. In Example 2, the block of sixes already starts early and expands even further to the left, filling in more positions with sixes at the beginning. In Example 3, where the block of sixes is more centrally located and smaller, the expansion still occurs, moving the block's start to an earlier position and spreading it out.\n\n5. **Deriving the Specific Rule**: It seems that the rule involves moving the first occurrence of a non-zero value (in these cases, '6') to the second position (if it's not already there or earlier), and the last occurrence of the non-zero value to the second last position that maintains the continuity of non-zero values without isolating any zeros within the non-zero block. However, the exact behavior, especially concerning how the non-zero values fill the gaps or move, requires a clearer pattern recognition.\n\n6. **Applying to the Test Input**: Given the input `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`, if we follow the observed pattern of expanding the non-zero block towards the edges while keeping the rule's specifics in mind, we should see the block of '3's expanding. The block starts at the 10th position and ends at the 17th position. According to the pattern, we might expect this block to expand, possibly starting from the 2nd position and ending at the 26th position, filling in gaps with the non-zero value ('3' in this case) and adjusting the zeros accordingly.\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, a more consistent interpretation of the rule, considering the expansion and filling pattern observed across examples, suggests that the non-zero elements (in this case, '3's) should fill the space between the first and last occurrence of these elements in the output, similar to how the '6's did in the examples. Given the input pattern and the aim to maintain continuity of non-zero values while filling in the gaps, the rule seems to imply a shift and expansion that ensures the non-zero block is as contiguous and expanded as possible within the constraints of the input's pattern.\n\nThus, considering this interpretation and applying it to the test input, we would anticipate the output to reflect this expansion and filling pattern, while keeping in mind the need to start and end the non-zero block in a manner consistent with the examples provided.\n\nGiven the test input and the derived rule, the predicted output, focusing on expanding the '3's block while maintaining the integrity of the observed patterns, would logically involve starting the '3's earlier and possibly ending them later, but always ensuring the block remains contiguous and expanded as per the examples.\n\n<output>0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

Thus, for the given input, moving elements to the left to remove gaps:\n  - The output would maintain the initial sequence: 3 8 4\n  - Followed by the next sequence without gaps: 7 7 1\n  - And the single element: 5\n  - With the rest of the elements being zeros due to the removal and shifting process.\n\nApplying this understanding, the output should be the initial sequences followed by the subsequent non-zero elements shifted as necessary, with the last element being zero if it was affected by such shifting or removals. \n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid, considering the pattern observed and the process described, would result in the non-zero elements being compacted towards the front while maintaining the integrity of the first sequence of non-zero numbers, and ensuring that the output ends with zeros to fill any gaps created by shifting elements according to the rule.\n\n<output>3 8 4 7 7 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

      "full_model_response": "To find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step.\n\n1. **Observing Patterns**: Looking at the examples, the first step is to identify any patterns or consistent changes from the input to the output. In all examples, the first element of the input grid is replaced by a different number in the output grid, but this difference is not immediately clear without further analysis.\n\n2. **Comparing Element by Element**: \n   - **Example 1 Input**: 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Example 1 Output**: 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Example 2 Input**: 3 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Example 2 Output**: 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Example 3 Input**: 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Example 3 Output**: 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   From these comparisons, it seems the rule might involve shifting or replacing certain elements based on their position or value, but the zeros seem to be playing a crucial role in determining the output.\n\n3. **Identifying the Rule**:\n   - In each example, the second non-zero element from the start is moved to the first position if we were to rearrange the non-zero elements in their original order but starting from the second non-zero element.\n   - However, looking closer, a simpler pattern emerges: the first non-zero number remains the same, the next non-zero number after a zero (if any) is moved to the second position (overwriting the existing second element), and the rest of the numbers seem to shift accordingly but only within their respective \"groups\" of non-zero or zero sequences.\n\n4. **Applying the Rule to the Examples**:\n   - In **Example 1**, the sequence starts with 6 (which remains), then there's a sequence of 6s followed by a 0. The next non-zero after this 0 (which is 6) is what gets reflected in the change from the input to the output, essentially the second 6 after the first 0 is moved forward.\n   - The same logic applies to **Example 2** and **Example 3**, where the non-zero element after the first zero is essentially \"promoted\" or moved forward in the sequence.\n\n5. **Deriving the Rule**:\n   - The rule appears to involve promoting the first non-zero number encountered after a zero to the position right after the first number, replacing whatever is in that position. This means if we have a sequence like \"X X 0 X\", it becomes \"X 0 X X\" after applying the rule, where X is any non-zero number.\n\n6. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - Given the input: 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Following the identified rule, the first non-zero after the first zero (which is 9) is moved to the second position. Thus, the output should be: 9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBased on the detailed analysis and the application of the identified rule, the predicted output for the given input grid is derived by applying the rule of promoting the first non-zero number after a zero to the position right after the first number.\n\n<output>9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

However, a more consistent rule seems to be related to the idea of \"expanding\" or \"moving\" the block of numbers to fill a certain space or to adjust its position relative to the zeros.\n\nUpon closer inspection, a clear rule emerges:\n- Identify the block of non-zero numbers.\n- If the block is not at the center (or seems out of place), adjust it so that it fills the space up to a certain point or moves to a specific position relative to the zeros.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\nGiven the test input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero number is '2'. Considering the rule and the patterns observed, it seems the task is to fill the space around the '2' with more '2's or move the '2' to a specific position. However, given the patterns observed, a direct shift or expansion similar to the examples isn't clearly defined without a consistent block of numbers to work with. \n\nGiven the lack of a clear, consistent pattern from the examples provided that directly applies to a single, isolated non-zero value in a sea of zeros, the most straightforward interpretation based on the given examples (involving blocks of numbers) doesn't neatly apply to this very different scenario of a single non-zero value.\n\nHowever, considering a possible misinterpretation in the analysis and aiming to follow the format as requested for the answer:\n\n<output>0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

The transformation seems to depend on the values present in the grid.\n\n2. **Analyze Columns**: Given the examples, it seems that the rule could be related to the maximum value present in each column of the grid or the presence of specific numbers.\n\n3. **Maximum Value Rule**: Observing the transformation, it appears that the output grid could be influenced by the maximum value in each position across the input grid. However, simply taking the maximum of each column doesn't exactly replicate the outputs provided.\n\n4. **Presence of Numbers**: Another approach is to consider the presence of numbers (0, 1, 2) and how they influence the output. In the outputs, we see segments of the same number, which suggests a rule based on the presence or absence of certain numbers.\n\n5. **Segmentation and Replacement**: Looking closely, it seems the rule might involve segmenting the grid based on the presence of '2's and then replacing segments with '2's or '0's based on some condition. Specifically, '2's seem to propagate or dominate certain sections of the grid.\n\n6. **Detailed Analysis of Example 1**:\n   - Input: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 2\n   - Output: 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n   - Observing the transformation, it appears that '2's have a dominant effect. Whenever '2' is present, it seems to fill in the gaps before the next significant segment (defined by '1's or other '2's). The '1's appear after a segment of '0's following a '2'.\n\n7. **Testing the Hypothesis**:\n   - Applying this observation to the other examples:\n     - In Example 2, the presence of '2's dictates the segments of '2's and '0's in the output, with '1's appearing in segments that are unrelated to the direct positioning of '2's in the input.\n     - In Example 3, the rule seems to hold as well, with '2's being dominant and dictating the structure of the output, and '1's appearing in later segments.\n\n8. **Deriving the Rule**:\n   - The rule seems to be: If a '2' is present in the input grid, the corresponding and preceding positions in the output grid are filled with '2's until a segment that would naturally be filled with '0's is encountered (based on the absence of '2's and the presence of '1's in the input). '1's appear in segments after a sequence of '0's following a '2' in the input.\n\n9. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - Input: 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0\n   - Applying the observed rule, we would fill the output grid based on the presence of '2's, the natural segmentation, and the appearance of '1's after segments of '0's.\n\nGiven the analysis, let's apply the derived rule to predict the output for the provided test input.\n\n<output>2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1</output>",

In the given examples, the input and output grids consist of numbers, but the specific numbers used in the examples are limited (0, 6, and 1 in the examples). This suggests that the rule might not depend on the specific values but rather on their presence or absence (i.e., binary presence/absence or a specific threshold).\n\n2. **Binary Representation**: Considering the numbers as binary (where any number greater than 0 is considered as 1), we can simplify the examples:\n   - Example 1 Input: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n   - Example 1 Output: 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Example 2 Input: 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Example 2 Output: 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Example 3 Input: 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\n   - Example 3 Output: 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Rule Identification**: Looking at the patterns, it seems that the rule could involve a transformation based on the presence or absence of a number in the input grid. However, the exact rule is not immediately clear from the binary simplification alone.\n\n4. **Analyzing Transitions**: Another approach is to look at how each element in the input grid influences the corresponding and neighboring elements in the output grid. Given the examples, it seems that the output might depend on the count of non-zero elements in a certain neighborhood around each cell in the input grid.\n\n5. **Specific Rule**: After closer inspection, a possible rule that fits all examples is:\n   - For each cell in the input grid, count the number of non-zero cells in its 3x3 neighborhood (including the cell itself).\n   - If the count is greater than or equal to 5, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to the maximum non-zero value present in the input grid's 3x3 neighborhood. Otherwise, it is set to 0.\n\nApplying this rule to the examples provided:\n- Example 1 and Example 2 seem to follow this rule when considering the transformation from input to output.\n- Example 3, although using different numbers (1 instead of 6), also follows the rule when considering the binary presence/absence interpretation.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\nGiven the test input grid:\n0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply the identified rule:\n- For each cell, count non-zero neighbors and itself within a 3x3 window.\n- If the count is >= 5, set the output cell to the maximum non-zero value in that window; otherwise, set it to 0.\n\nGiven the specific arrangement of the test input, we can predict the output by applying the rule cell by cell.\n\n**Output Calculation**:\nCalculating for each cell based on the rule provided:\n- The first row (considering the grid is arranged in rows of 4 for simplicity): \n  - First cell: 0 (since the 3x3 window around it doesn't have 5 non-zero cells).\n  - Second cell: 7 (because the window around it includes at least 5 non-zero cells).\n  - Third cell: 7 (same reason).\n  - Fourth cell: 7 (same reason).\n- Continuing this process for each cell, we observe patterns where clusters of non-zero values in the input grid lead to non-zero values in the output grid, according to the rule.\n\n**Final Output**:\nAfter applying the rule to each cell in the test input grid, the resulting output grid, based on the pattern and rule identified, would reflect the transformation according to the presence and clustering of non-zero values.\n\n<output>7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

The '3's are all moved to the front in the first part of the output, and the zeros are then appended.\n\n2. **Example 2**:\n   - Input:  5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\n   - Output: 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n   - Observation: Similar to Example 1, the non-zero numbers seem to be replicated in the first part of the output, and the rest is filled with zeros except for the last element.\n\n3. **Example 3**:\n   - Input:  1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n   - Output: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: This example seems to slightly differ from the first two, as the replication of '1's does not extend to fill the first part of the output as observed in Examples 1 and 2. However, looking closer, it seems that the pattern might involve moving or reflecting a certain portion of the input to the output.\n\nUpon closer inspection and considering all examples, the initial observations seem to have been somewhat misleading due to the attempt to find a pattern based on limited and possibly incorrect assumptions. Given the examples provided, a more accurate approach involves recognizing a pattern that might not directly relate to simple mirroring or replication but involves a transformation based on the input's structure.\n\nHowever, given the complexity and the seeming inconsistency across examples, let's reassess with a focus on a logical transformation rule that could apply:\n\n- A common rule could involve the distribution or transformation of the non-zero elements in a way that doesn't directly correlate with simple copying or mirroring. The rule seems complex and not straightforward from the examples provided.\n\nGiven the test input:\n2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nAnd reevaluating the examples with a focus on finding a consistent rule, it appears the initial analysis might not directly lead to a clear, simple transformation rule without making several assumptions. The examples provided suggest a transformation that isn't immediately clear or consistent across all cases without a more detailed or specific rule being applied.\n\nUpon further reflection, it seems the task requires identifying a pattern or rule that isn't directly inferable from the given examples without a deeper understanding of the intended transformation. The output grids seem to reflect a change in the distribution of numbers but in a manner that isn't uniformly applied across all examples provided.\n\nGiven the constraint of the format and the need to provide an answer, the process highlights the complexity of deriving a rule from the given examples. The correct approach involves carefully analyzing the input-output pairs to discern a consistent pattern or rule, which may involve more complex transformations than initially considered.\n\nGiven the provided examples and the test input, predicting the output based on a clear, identifiable rule from the examples is challenging without further clarification on the transformation logic. However, the task implies that there should be a recognizable pattern or rule at play.\n\n<output>2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2</output>",

This rule is observed in the transition from the input to the output.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis**:\n   - Input:  2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 8 2 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observations: Similar to Example 1, sequences of '2's not adjacent to '0's are replaced with '8's, while '2's adjacent to '0's remain '2'. This example reinforces the idea that adjacency to '0' is a determinant factor in whether a '2' is converted to an '8'.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis**:\n   - Input:  0 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 8 2 0 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observations: This example further supports the rule observed. The '2's that are not directly next to a '0' are converted to '8's, while those '2's directly adjacent to '0's are not converted, remaining as '2's.\n\nGiven these observations, the common rule appears to be:\n- Replace sequences of '2's with '8's, but do not convert a '2' to an '8' if it is directly adjacent to a '0'.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input grid:\nInput: 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n\nWe should convert all '2's to '8's except for those directly adjacent to '0's. So, the first sequence of '2's is not adjacent to '0' on its left (since it starts with '0' and the '0' is on the left) but is adjacent on its right. The last sequence of '2's is adjacent to '0' on its right.\n\nThus, the output should reflect '2's being converted to '8's except where adjacent to '0's:\nOutput: 0 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 8 8 8 8 8 0\n\nLet's correct this based on a strict interpretation of the rule where '2's are converted unless directly adjacent to a '0'. The precise application considering left and right adjacency to '0's for every '2' yields:\n0 2 (adjacent to 0) remains 2, \nthe sequence 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 not adjacent to any 0 (on the right side of the first 0 and before the next 0) should be converted to 8's. \nThen 2 (before the double 0) remains 2, \nthe zeros remain zeros, \nthe last sequence 2 2 2 2 2 2 is also not adjacent to any 0 (since it ends with a 0 which doesn't convert the preceding 2 to an 8 based on the rules observed) so it should convert to 8's except possibly the last due to adjacency. However, in our analysis of examples, conversion happens unless there's direct adjacency, suggesting these should convert fully except the immediate one next to the zero. \n\nTherefore, applying the corrected understanding of the rule:\nThe first '2' remains a '2', the long sequence of '2's converts to '8's, the '2' before the double '0' remains a '2', the last sequence of '2's also converts except possibly the one right next to '0'.\n\nFinal application considering this detailed step-by-step analysis provides the output:\n<output>0 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 8 8 8 8 8 0</output>",

In the output, this sequence starts at the 16th position and ends at the 25th position. Essentially, the block of 1s has shifted 4 positions to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis**:\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 5s in the input starts at the 16th position and ends at the 18th position.

The block of 5s has shifted 3 positions to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis**:\n   - Input: 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 9s in the input starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 14th position. In the output, this sequence starts at the 5th position and ends at the 17th position. The block of 9s has shifted 3 positions to the right.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer that the rule involves shifting the block of non-zero numbers in the input grid to the right by a certain number of positions to obtain the output grid. However, the exact number of positions to shift is not constant across all examples, which suggests that the shift might depend on the length of the block of non-zero numbers or its starting position.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it seems that the block of non-zero numbers is shifted to the right by a number of positions equal to the difference between the total length of the grid and the length of the block of non-zero numbers, divided by 2, or simply by a fixed number of positions that seems consistent with the examples provided, which could be misinterpreted without a clear pattern.\n\nGiven the examples, a simpler and more consistent interpretation could be that the block of non-zero numbers is shifted to the right by a fixed number of positions, which appears to be 4 in Example 1. However, this does not hold consistently across all examples provided, suggesting that the actual rule might involve a different kind of transformation or a more complex condition for the shift.\n\nReevaluating the examples with the goal of finding a consistent rule:\n- In Example 1, the block of 1s shifts 4 positions to the right.\n- In Example 2, the block of 5s shifts 3 positions to the right.\n- In Example 3, the block of 9s effectively expands and shifts, but if we consider the shift of the right edge of the block, it also moves.\n\nGiven the inconsistency in the shift amounts and the expansion in Example 3, let's reconsider the rule:\n- The rule might not be a simple shift but could involve expanding or shifting the block of non-zero numbers based on its length or position within the grid.\n\nHowever, a simpler rule that could apply, given the examples, is that the block of non-zero numbers is shifted to the right, but the exact mechanism of this shift isn't clearly defined by a single operation (like a fixed shift) across all examples. The expansion in Example 3 suggests a potential for the block to grow or move based on its initial position and length.\n\nGiven the test input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnd considering the need for a consistent rule that applies across the examples provided, let's apply a potential rule that could fit, assuming a shift or expansion pattern. However, without a clear, consistent rule from the examples, the prediction might not align perfectly with the intended output.\n\nIf we were to apply a shift similar to the examples, considering the block of 8s is 4 positions long, starting at the 14th position, a potential shift could involve moving this block, but the direction and amount are not clearly defined by the examples provided.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies and the attempt to find a rule that fits all examples, let's predict the output based on a potential for the block to shift or expand, acknowledging that the provided examples do not clearly define a single, consistent rule for all cases.\n\n<output>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

In all examples, the input grid contains a sequence of zeros and a block of identical non-zero numbers (3, 2, and 6 in the examples).\n\n2. **Analyzing Example 1**:\n   - Input: A block of zeros, followed by a block of 3s, and then another block of zeros.\n   - Output: The block of 3s extends into the preceding block of zeros by one position from the left but does not extend into the following block of zeros on the right; instead, it stops one position before the end of the 3s block in the input and is followed by zeros.\n   \n3. **Analyzing Example 2**:\n   - Input: Similar to Example 1, but with 2s instead of 3s.\n   - Output: The block of 2s extends one position to the left into the zeros but stops two positions before the end of the 2s block in the input, with the last two positions of the output being zeros.\n   \n4. **Analyzing Example 3**:\n   - Input: A block of zeros, followed by a block of 6s, and then another block of zeros.\n   - Output: The block of 6s extends one position to the left into the block of zeros but stops one position before the end of the 6s block in the input, with the rest being zeros.\n\n**Deriving the Rule**:\nFrom these observations, a common rule can be inferred:\n- The non-zero block in the input extends one position to the left into the preceding block of zeros.\n- The non-zero block stops one position before its original end in the input, and the rest of the output is filled with zeros.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\nGiven the test input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the derived rule:\n- The block of 6s extends one position to the left, so the 13th position (originally a zero) becomes a 6.\n- The block of 6s stops one position before its original end.

The output shifts the block of 7s to the left by one position.\n   - **Example 2** has a block of 8s in the middle, surrounded by zeros. The output shifts this block of 8s to the left by two positions.\n   - **Example 3** presents a block of 4s centered in the grid, also surrounded by zeros. The output shifts this block of 4s to the left by two positions as well.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**:\n   - From the examples, it appears that the rule involves shifting the block of non-zero numbers (the \"block\") within the grid. \n   - The shift seems to be towards the left, but the number of positions shifted varies in the examples provided.\n\n3. **Determining the Shift Amount**:\n   - Looking closer, the shift might be related to the number of elements in the block or its position within the grid. However, a simpler explanation could be that the block is shifted by a fixed amount, regardless of its size or content.\n   - The first example shifts one position to the left, which could be an anomaly or a special case. The second and third examples both shift the block two positions to the left. This inconsistency requires further consideration.\n\n4. **Reevaluating the Examples**:\n   - Upon reevaluation, it seems that the initial observation might have been too hasty. The shift doesn't seem to directly correlate with the size or specific value of the block but rather with a fixed adjustment in its position.\n   - Considering the examples again with the focus on the overall pattern rather than the specifics of each block (size, value), a more consistent rule might involve shifting the block to the left by a fixed number of positions, which appears to be two positions based on the majority of the examples.\n\n5. **Deriving the Rule**:\n   - Given the analysis, a plausible rule is that the block of non-zero numbers is shifted two positions to the left. This rule applies to all examples provided, except for the first, which could be seen as an outlier or a test of the observer's ability to discern patterns beyond simple numerical shifts.\n\n6. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - The test input contains a block of 8s: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`.\n   - Applying the derived rule, we shift the block of 8s two positions to the left, resulting in the output grid.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis and application of the derived rule, the predicted output for the test input grid is:\n\n<output>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

In all examples, the input grid consists of two types of numbers: a non-zero number (which varies across examples, e.g., 9 in Example 1 and 3 in Examples 2 and 3) and zeros. The output grid also consists of the same non-zero number and zeros but arranged differently.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: Upon closer inspection, it seems that the rule involves replicating or extending the non-zero numbers in such a way that they form a larger solid block or \"fill in\" certain areas of the grid, while zeros are either maintained or become part of the areas where the non-zero numbers expand.\n\n3. **Detailed Analysis**:\n   - **Example 1**: The input has a row of 9s at the top and bottom, with zeros in between except for a block of 9s in the middle row. The output essentially fills in the middle part with 9s, ensuring that the top and bottom rows are fully connected with the middle block of 9s.\n   - **Example 2**: Here, the input starts with a row of 3s, followed by a row of zeros, then a 3 in the middle row surrounded by zeros. The output connects the top row of 3s with the middle 3, forming a larger block of connected 3s, and also extends the 3s at the bottom to fill in what seems to be a \"missing\" column of 3s.\n   - **Example 3**: Similar to Example 2, the input has a top row of 3s, a middle row with a single 3, and a layout that suggests the 3s are trying to form a connected block. The output extends the 3s to fill in gaps, making sure that the 3s form a larger, more connected block.\n\n4. **Deriving the Rule**: From these observations, the rule seems to be about **connecting and expanding blocks of non-zero numbers** to form larger, solid blocks or to connect separate blocks of the same non-zero number. The goal is to have as few disconnected blocks of the non-zero number as possible, ideally aiming for a single large block or a configuration where these numbers are maximally connected.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   Given the input:\n   ```\n3 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n   To apply the rule, we need to connect the blocks of 3s. The input can be visualized as a grid where the first row and parts of subsequent rows contain 3s, with zeros separating them. The goal is to extend or connect these 3s to form a larger block.\n\n   **Visualizing the Grid** (assuming a 5x5 grid for simplicity, given 25 numbers):\n   ```\n3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3\n   ```\n   **Applying the Rule**: We want to connect the blocks of 3s. Given the layout, we can achieve this by filling in the gaps between the 3s, especially focusing on connecting the top row with the column of 3s below it.\n\n   **Output**:\n   ```\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n   ```\n   This output connects all the 3s into a single large block, applying the observed rule of maximizing the connection between blocks of the same non-zero number.\n\n<output>3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3</output>",

      "full_model_response": "To derive the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n1. **Observation of Patterns**: The first step is to look for patterns or changes from the input to the output grids. In all examples, the number 2 in the input grid sometimes changes to 8 in the output grid, but not consistently. This indicates that the transformation rule might depend on the position or context of the number 2 within the grid.\n\n2. **Contextual Transformation**: Looking closer, it seems that the transformation of 2 to 8 might be related to its position relative to other numbers, particularly zeros. However, the exact pattern isn't immediately clear because the transformation doesn't seem to follow a simple rule based on immediate neighbors.\n\n3. **Row or Column-Based Transformation**: Another possibility is that the transformation rule applies to rows or columns. In the examples, when a row or column contains more than a certain number of consecutive 2s, those 2s are transformed into 8s, except for the last two 2s in such a sequence.\n\n4. **Deriving the Rule**: Given the observations, the rule could be as follows: In any sequence of 2s within a row (assuming the grid is structured in rows as implied by the examples), if the sequence has more than 4 consecutive 2s, the first 2s in the sequence are transformed into 8s until only two 2s are left at the end of the sequence. Sequences with 4 or fewer consecutive 2s remain unchanged.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the provided test input grid:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\nBreaking down the input into sequences based on the presence of zeros:\n- The first sequence is `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`, which has 8 consecutive 2s. According to the rule, this should transform into `8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2`.\n- The second sequence, separated by a zero, is `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`, which also has 8 consecutive 2s. Applying the rule, it transforms into `8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2`.\n- The trailing zeros remain unchanged as they do not contain sequences of 2s that need transformation.\n\nTherefore, applying the derived rule to the test input grid, the predicted output grid would be:\n```\n8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n<output>8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</output>",

Otherwise, leave the zero unchanged, especially if it is at the end of a sequence leading into more zeros or is an isolated zero without adjacent non-zero numbers to connect.\n\n6. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - Input: 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n   - Applying the observed pattern:\n     - The first zero is between 4 and 5, so it becomes 3.\n     - The second zero is also between 4 and 5, so it becomes 3.\n     - The third and fourth zeros are between 5 and 9, so they become 3.\n     - The fifth zero is after 9 and before more zeros, so it remains 0.\n     - The last zeros trail off without connecting any non-zero numbers, so they remain 0.\n\nGiven the rule, the output for the test input should reflect the replacement of zeros according to the pattern observed and the rule derived.\n\n<output>4 3 3 5 5 3 3 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0</output>",
