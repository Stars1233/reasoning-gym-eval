In that circle, every colleague knows each other, so each female in that circle (including Matilda) has the other 2 females as colleagues. John's circle has 4 male and 1 female colleague, which is Matilda. However, aside from Matilda, the persons in John's circle are isolated within that group. Since the only female in John's circle is Matilda herself, she gains no additional female colleagues from that circle. Thus, the only female colleagues Matilda has are the other two from Jennifer's circle.\n</think>\n<answer>2</answer>",
