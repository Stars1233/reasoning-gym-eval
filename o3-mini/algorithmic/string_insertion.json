If there is a substring CDEA in the string, insert the character C after the substring.\n4. If there is a substring DEAB in the string, insert the character D after the substring.\n5. If there is a substring EABC in the string, insert the character E after the substring.\n\nOnce you have inserted a character, you have to skip over the substring and the inserted character and continue the search from the next character.\n\nExample\n- Input: DDABCDEEDEAB\n- Output: DDABCDAEEDEABD\n- Explanation:\n    - Theere are two inserted characters: DDABCD[A]EEDEAB[D] (shown in square brackets)\n    - First, we insert A after ABCD.\n    - Even though with the newly inserted 'A' we can obtain the substring BCD[A], we can't use it to insert another character.\n    - Lastly, we insert D after DEAB.\n    - Therefore, the final answer is DDABCDAEEDEABD (represented as a string, instead of a list of characters).\n\nGiven the following string, provide the answer after inserting the characters according to the pattern: ECAACBBDABEAEEAECDAA\n",
